{"paragraphes": ["James Earl   Jimmy   Carter, Jr. (born October 1, 1924) is an American politician and author who served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Carter Center . ", "Carter, a Democrat raised in rural Georgia , was a peanut farmer who served two terms as a Georgia State Senator , from 1963 to 1967, and one as the Governor of Georgia , from 1971 to 1975. He was elected President in 1976 , defeating incumbent President Gerald Ford in a relatively close election, the Electoral College margin of 57 votes was the closest at that time since 1916 . ", "On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all evaders of the Vietnam War drafts. During his term as President, Carter created two new cabinet-level departments, the Department of Energy and the Department of Education . He established a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the Camp David Accords , the Panama Canal Treaties , the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. On the economic front he confronted persistent  stagflation  , a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 19791981 Iran hostage crisis , the 1979 energy crisis , the Three Mile Island nuclear accident , and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In response to the Soviet move he ended dtente, escalated the Cold War, and led the international boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. By 1980, Carter's popularity had eroded such that, running for re-election that year, he ran against Ted Kennedy in the Democratic Party's primaries for the presidential nomination , marking the most recent Democratic primary in which an incumbent faced opposition. Carter won the 1980 primary with a mere 51.13% of the vote (all incumbent candidates since have won at least 72.8% of their party's primary votes) but lost the general election in an electoral landslide to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan , who won 44 of 50 states. ", "Although many consider him to have accomplished more with his post-presidency work, his presidency has drawn medium-low responses from historians. He set up the Carter Center in 1982 as his base for advancing human rights. He has also traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, observe elections, and advance disease prevention and eradication in developing nations. Additionally, Carter is a key figure in the Habitat for Humanity project. Regarding current political views, he has criticized of some of Israel's actions and policies in regards to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict . He has vigorously opposed the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC to strike down McCain-Feingold limits on campaign spending by corporations and unions, saying that America is  no longer a functioning democracy  and now has a system of  unlimited political bribery .  He is a supporter of President Obama but has been critical of aspects of his foreign policy, particularly with regard to the use of drones and Obama's decision not to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp . ", "In August 2015, at age 90, Carter was diagnosed with melanoma which had metastasized to his liver and brain, and he began treatment which included surgery, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy. ", "", "", "Carter was born on October 1, 1924, at the Wise Sanatorium in Plains, Georgia . [ note 1 ] He is a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in Virginia in 1635. Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia. Established in Sumter County , Plains was a boomtown of 600 people when Carter was born. Carter's father, James Earl Carter, Sr. , was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and had begun to invest in farmland. He had been a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps during World War I . Carter's mother, Bessie Lillian Gordy , was a nurse at the Wise hospital. Carter was the first of Earl and Lillian's children; they moved several times during his infancy.   ", "The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery, which was almost entirely populated by impoverished African American families. They eventually had three more children Gloria , Ruth , and Billy . Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood. Although Earl was staunchly pro-segregation, he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children. An enterprising teenager, Carter was given his own acre of Earl's farmland where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts. Carter also rented out a section of tenant housing he had purchased.   ", "Carter attended the Plains High School from 1930, first grade, to 1941. The Great Depression had by then impoverished Archery and Plains, but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies, and Earl took a position as a community leader. Young Carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. [ note 2 ] Carter's teacher, Julia Coleman, was an especially strong influence. As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team; he also joined the Future Farmers of America and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking.   ", "Carter had long dreamed of attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis . Meanwhile, he enrolled at Georgia Southwestern College in nearby Americus . After taking additional mathematics courses at Georgia Tech , he was finally admitted to the Naval Academy in 1943. With his diminutive stature, Carter barely met the minimum physical requirements for entry. He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen. While at the academy, Carter fell in love with his sister Ruth's friend Rosalynn Smith, whom he would marry shortly after his graduation in 1946.   Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 and was commissioned as an ensign .   From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived temporarily in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, and California, as he served deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets .   Promoted to a LTJG , he completed qualification for command of a diesel-electric submarine. In late 1952, he was admitted to the US Navy's fledgling nuclear submarine program led by then-Captain Hyman G. Rickover . Rickover's demands on his men and machines were legendary, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover was the greatest influence on his life.   ", "On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada 's Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown. The resulting explosion caused millions of liters of radioactive water to flood the reactor building's basement, and the reactor's core was no longer usable.   Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U.S. maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor.   The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for a few minutes at a time, limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor. During and after his presidency, Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease development of a neutron bomb .   ", "Carter took non-credit classes at Union College in Schenectady, New York, in 1953.   Upon the death of his father that July, the family business became his, but deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult. Rosalynn had also grown comfortable with their life. Returning to small-town life in Plains seemed  a monumental step backward,  she said later. On the other hand, Carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his father's. Thus resigning his commission, Carter was honorably discharged from the Navy on October 9, 1953.     ", "Earl Carter died a relatively wealthy man, having also recently been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives . However, between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs, his son Jimmy inherited comparatively little. For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains; Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in housing subsidized for the poor. Knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, however, Carter set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business. The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult, as the harvest his first year failed due to drought; Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat. Meanwhile, he also took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books. Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful.     ", "Racial tension was inflamed in Plains by the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court 's anti-segregation ruling in Brown v. Board of Education . Carter was in favor of racial tolerance and integrationat one point, the local White Citizens' Council boycotted his peanut warehouse when he refused to join thembut he often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies. By 1961 he was a prominent member of the community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board, where he began to speak more loudly in favor of school integration.   A state Senate seat was opened by the dissolution of Georgia's County Unit System in 1962; Carter announced his run for the seat 15 days before the election. Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. The initial results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the sheriff of Quitman County . Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won.   ", "The Civil Rights Movement was well underway as Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch John F. Kennedy supporters. In 1962, the town of Americus was the site of mass beatings and incarcerations of black protesters, echoing similar unrest throughout the country. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. He did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the Georgia Constitution which, he felt, implied a compulsion to practice religion.   A diligent legislator, Carter took speed-reading courses to keep up with the workload. Within two years his connections landed him on the state Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration. When Bo Callaway was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter immediately began planning to unseat him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state; Carter wanted it to go to Georgia Southwestern College in Americus, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus . Carter saw Callaway, a Republican , as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics.   ", "Carter was re-elected in 1964 to serve a second two-year term. For a time in the State Senate, he chaired its Education Committee; he also sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term. Before his term ended he contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. The last day of the term, he announced his run for Congress.   ", "The congressional race was shaken up in mid-May when Callaway dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia instead. Callaway was a very strong candidate, and state Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since Reconstruction . Carter soon decided to follow Callaway and run for governor himself. In the Democratic primary he ran as a moderate alternative to both the liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox . In a press conference he described his ideology as  Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road. ... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.    He lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox. A chain of events then resulted in Maddox, the dark horse candidate , being elected governor. [ note 3 ] The result was a sharp blow to Carter, who was left deeply in debt. His attempt to rescue the race from Callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist Maddox, which he considered an even worse outcome.   ", "Carter returned to his agriculture business and, during the next four years, carefully planned his next campaign for Governor in 1970. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he grew increasingly evangelical, undertaking several religious missions in other states. Inspired by his sister Ruth and liberal theologians such as Reinhold Niebuhr , he declared himself born again , a growing movement in 1960s America. His last child Amy was born around this time.     ", "The liberal former governor, Carl Sanders , was Carter's main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign this time around, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to poll data, Carter leaned more conservative than before. He positioned himself as a populist , quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth (labeling him  Cufflinks Carl ) and associating him with the national Democratic Party. He accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, could come up with no evidence.     Throughout the campaign Carter sought both the black vote and the  Wallace vote , after the prominent segregationist George Wallace . While he met with black figures such as Martin Luther King, Sr. and Andrew Young , and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. He implied support or dislike of private schools depending on the audience. The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.     ", "That September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff. The campaign grew even more bitter; Carter's campaign criticized Sanders for supporting Martin Luther King, Jr. Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the votewinning 7 percent of the black voteand went on to win the general election easily over the Republican Hal Suit , a local news anchor. Once he was elected, Carter began to speak confidently against Georgia's racist politics. Leroy Johnson , a black state Senator, voiced his support for Carter, saying,  I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign. ... I don't believe you can win this state without being a racist.    ", "Carter was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. He declared in his inaugural speech that  the time of racial segregation was over. No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever again have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education, a job, or simple justice.  The crowd was reportedly shocked by this message, contrasting starkly with Georgia's political culture and particularly Carter's campaign. The many segregationists who had supported Carter during the race felt betrayed. Time magazine ran a story on the progressive   New South   governors elected that year in a May 1971 issue, featuring a cover illustration of Carter.       ", "Lester Maddox , Carter's predecessor as governor, became lieutenant governor . Carter had endorsed Maddox, although the two did not campaign as a ticket . The two found little common ground during their four years of service, often publicly feuding with each other.   Richard Russell, Jr. , then President pro tempore of the United States Senate , died in office during Carter's second week in office; the newly inaugurated governor appointed David H. Gambrell , state Democratic Party chair, to fill Russell's unexpired term in the Senate.   ", "With Carter's reluctance to engage in back-slapping and political favors, the legislature found him frustrating to work with.     He looked to aggressively expand the governor's authority while reducing the complexity of the state government. Therefore, he negotiated a bill allowing him to propose executive restructuring and to force a vote on it. He implemented zero-based budgeting within state departments and added a Judicial Selection Commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor.   The reorganization plan was submitted in January 1972, but had a cool reception in the legislature. After two weeks of negotiations it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session.   Ultimately he merged about 300 state agencies into 22a fact he would emphasize in his presidential runalthough it is disputed that there were any overall cost savings from doing so.   ", "Civil rights were a heartfelt priority for Carter. He expanded the number of black state employees, judges, and board members. He hired Rita Jackson Samuels, a black woman, to advise him on potential appointments.   He placed portraits of Martin Luther King, Jr., and two other prominent black Georgians in the capitol building, even as the Ku Klux Klan picketed the unveiling ceremony.   Still, Carter tried to keep his conservative allies comfortable. He co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.   After the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Georgia's death penalty statute in Furman v. Georgia (1972), Carter signed a revised death penalty statute which addressed the court's objections, thus re-introducing the practice in the state. Carter later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying,  I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now.    ", "Carter pushed reforms through the legislature to provide equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of Georgia, set up community centers for mentally handicapped children, and increased educational programs for convicts. He took pride in his program for the appointment of judges and state government officials. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit, rather than political influence.     ", "In one of his more controversial decisions,   he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River . After surveying the river and the literature himself, he argued that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was underestimating both the project's cost and its impact on the region. The veto won the attention of environmentalists nationwide.   When Lieutenant William Calley was convicted in a military trial and sentenced to life for his role in the My Lai Massacre in South Vietnam , a politically polarizing issue, Carter avoided paying direct tribute to Calley. He instead instituted  American Fighting Man's Day  and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of the military.   ", "Looking toward a potential presidential run, Carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention , where the liberal U.S. Senator George McGovern was the likely presidential nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative, anti-McGovern voters, so that the convention would consider him for McGovern's running mate on a compromise ticket. He endorsed Senator Henry  Scoop  Jackson , in part to distance himself from George Wallace. Carter was still fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the 1972 Democratic ticket went to McGovern and Senator Thomas Eagleton .   ", "After McGovern's loss in November 1972, Carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff. He had quietly decided to begin putting a presidential bid together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the National Governors Association to boost his visibility. On David Rockefeller 's endorsement he was named to the Trilateral Commission in April 1973. The following year he was named chairman of the Democratic National Committee 's congressional, as well as gubernatorial, campaigns.   In 1973 he appeared on the game show What's My Line , where a group of celebrity panelists would try to guess his occupation. None recognized him and it took several rounds of question-and-answer before movie critic Gene Shalit correctly guessed he was a governor.   ", "When Carter entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries in 1976, he was considered to have little chance against nationally better-known politicians; his name recognition was two percent. As the Watergate scandal of President Nixon was still fresh in the voters' minds, Carter's position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C., became an asset. He promoted government reorganization. Carter published Why Not the Best? in June 1976 to help introduce himself to the American public.   ", "Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary . He used a two-prong strategy: In the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama's George Wallace , Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters; he had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there. He had traveled over 50,000 miles, visited 37 states, and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidates announced that they were in the race.   Initially dismissed as a regional candidate, Carter proved to be the only Democrat with a truly national strategy, and he clinched the nomination.

It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.   ", "Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of Playboy for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said:  I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.    He is the only interviewee of Playboy to become US president.   ", "As late as January 26, 1976, Carter was the first choice of only four percent of Democratic voters, according to a Gallup poll . [ citation needed ] Yet  by mid-March 1976 Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, he also led President Ford by a few percentage points , according to Shoup.   ", "He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale as his running mate. He attacked Washington in his speeches, and offered a religious salve for the nation's wounds.   ", "Carter began the race with a sizable lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in a narrow defeat on November 2, 1976. Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240. Carter became the first contender from the Deep South to be elected President since the 1848 election . Carter carried fewer states than Ford23 states to the defeated Ford's 27yet Carter won with the largest percentage of the popular vote (50.1 percent) of any non-incumbent since Dwight Eisenhower . [ citation needed ] ", "Carter's tenure was a time of continuing inflation and recession , as well as an energy crisis . Among his first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War -era draft evaders .     On January 7, 1980, Carter signed Law H.R. 5860 aka Public Law 96-185 known as The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, bailing out Chrysler Corporation . He canceled military pay raises during a time of high inflation and government deficits. [ citation needed ] ", "Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world, most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the Camp David Accords ; giving back the Panama Canal ; and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev . His final year was marred by the Iran hostage crisis , which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan .   There is strong evidence that he supported and helped to instigate the IranIraq War .   ", "On November 4, 1979 a group of Iranian students, belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line , who were supporting the Iranian Revolution , took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran .   Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for the next 444 days until January 20, 1981. During the crisis, Carter remained in isolation in the White House for more than 100 days, until he left to participate in the lighting of the National Menorah on the ellipse.   On April 24, 1980, Carter ordered Operation Eagle Claw to try free the hostages. The mission failed leaving eight American servicemen dead and the destruction of two aircraft. ", "On April 18, 1977, Carter delivered a televised speech declaring that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was the moral equivalent of war . He encouraged energy conservation by all U.S. citizens and installed solar water heating panels on the White House .     He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House.   ", "In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls, New York . More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created in response to the situation.   Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which were built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes. This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken. Carter acknowledged that several more  Love Canals  existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was  one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era .   ", "In 1977, Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn , a professor of economics at Cornell University , to be chair of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading 'think tanks' in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978. [ citation needed ] ", "The Airline Deregulation Act ( Pub.L. 95504 ) was signed into law by President Carter on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from commercial aviation . The Civil Aeronautics Board 's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the FAA's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.

This Carter deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft microbrew culture in the United States, with 3,418 micro breweries, brewpubs, and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2014.   ", "In response to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , Carter called for a boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which raised a bitter controversy.   It was the only time since the founding of the modern Olympics in 1896 that the United States had not participated in a Summer or Winter Olympics. The Soviet Union retaliated by boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. It did not withdraw troops from Afghanistan until 1989 (eight years after Carter left office). ", "Carter later wrote that the most intense and mounting opposition to his policies came from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which he attributed to Ted Kennedy 's ambition to replace him as president.   Kennedy surprised his supporters by running a weak campaign, and Carter won most of the primaries and secured renomination. However, Kennedy had mobilized the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which gave Carter weak support in the fall election.   ", "Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980 was one of the most difficult, and least successful, in history. He faced strong challenges from the right (Republican Ronald Reagan ), the center (independent John B. Anderson ), and the left (Democrat Ted Kennedy ).

He alienated liberal college students, who were expected to be his base, by re-instating registration for the military draft. His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft , stepped down some five weeks before the general election amid what turned out to have been an uncorroborated allegation of cocaine use.

Carter described Blair's actions as  abominable  and stated that the British Prime Minister's  almost undeviating support for the ill-advised policies of President Bush in Iraq have been a major tragedy for the world.  Carter said he believes that had Blair distanced himself from the Bush administration during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , it might have made a crucial difference to American political and public opinion, and consequently the invasion might not have gone ahead. Carter states that  one of the defenses of the Bush administration... has been, okay, we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because Great Britain is backing us.

Wade and I did everything I could to minimize the need for abortions. I made it easy to adopt children for instance who were unwanted and also initiated the program called Women and Infant Children or WIC program that's still in existence now. But except for the times when a mother's life is in danger or when a pregnancy is caused by rape or incest I would certainly not or never have approved of any abortions.

He said that the view that women are inferior is not confined to one faith,  nor, tragically does its influence stop at the walls of the church, mosque, synagogue or temple.  Carter stated: ", "The truth is that male religious leaders have hadand still havean option to interpret holy teachings either to exalt or subjugate women. They have, for their own selfish ends, overwhelmingly chosen the latter. Their continuing choice provides the foundation or justification for much of the pervasive persecution and abuse of women throughout the world. This is in clear violation not just of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but also the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Apostle Paul, Moses and the prophets, Muhammad, and founders of other great religionsall of whom have called for proper and equitable treatment of all the children of God.
