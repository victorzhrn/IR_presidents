of the United States  18171825   Monroe was the last president who was a Founding Father of the United States and the last president from the Virginian dynasty and the Republican Generation     Born in Westmoreland County   Virginia   Monroe was of the planter class and fought in the American Revolutionary War   He was wounded in the Battle of Trenton with a musket ball to his shoulder  After studying law under Thomas Jefferson from 1780 to 1783  he served as a delegate in the Continental Congress   As an anti federalist delegate to the Virginia convention that considered ratification of the United States Constitution   Monroe opposed ratification   claiming it gave too much power to the central government  He took an active part in the new government  and in 1790 he was elected to the Senate of the first United States Congress   where he joined the Jeffersonians   He gained experience as an executive as the Governor of Virginia and rose to national prominence as a diplomat in France  when he helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase in 1803  During the War of 1812   Monroe held the critical roles of Secretary of State and the Secretary of War under President James Madison      Facing little opposition from the fractured Federalist Party   Monroe was easily elected president in 1816  winning over 80 percent of the electoral vote and becoming the last president during the First Party System era of American politics  As president  he bought Florida from Spain and sought to ease partisan tensions  embarking on a tour of the country that was generally well received  With the ratification of the Treaty of 1818   under the successful diplomacy of his Secretary of State John Quincy Adams   the United States extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific   giving America harbor and fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest   The United States and Britain jointly occupied the Oregon Country   In addition to the acquisition of Florida  the landmark Treaty of 1819 secured the border of the United States along the 42nd Parallel to the Pacific Ocean and represented America s first determined attempt at creating an  American global empire     As nationalism surged  partisan fury subsided and the   Era of Good Feelings   ensued until the Panic of 1819 struck and dispute over the admission of Missouri embroiled the country in 1820  Nonetheless  Monroe won near unanimous reelection    Monroe supported the founding of colonies in Africa for free African Americans that would eventually form the nation of Liberia   whose capital  Monrovia   is named in his honor  In 1823  he announced the United States  opposition to any European intervention in the recently independent countries of the Americas with the Monroe Doctrine   which became a landmark in American foreign policy  His presidency concluded the first period of American presidential history before the beginning of Jacksonian democracy and the Second Party System era  Following his retirement in 1825  Monroe was plagued by financial difficulties  He died in New York City on July 4  1831     James Monroe was born on April 28  1758  in his parents  house located in a wooded area of Westmoreland County  Virginia   The site is marked and is one mile from the unincorporated community known today as Monroe Hall  Virginia   The James Monroe Family Home Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979    His father Spence Monroe  17271774  was a moderately prosperous planter who also practiced carpentry  His mother Elizabeth Jones  17301774  married Spence Monroe in 1752 and they had several children     His paternal great grandfather Patrick Andrew Monroe emigrated to America from Scotland in the mid 17th century  In 1650 he patented a large tract of land in Washington Parish  Westmoreland County  Virginia   Among James Monroe s ancestors were French Huguenot immigrants  who came to Virginia in 1700     First tutored at home by his mother Elizabeth  between the ages of 11 and 16  the young Monroe studied at Campbell town Academy  a school run by Reverend Archibald Campbell of Washington Parish  There he excelled as a pupil and progressed through Latin and mathematics faster than most boys his age  John Marshall   later Chief Justice of the United States   was among his classmates   Upon the death of his father in 1774  Monroe inherited his small plantation and slaves  officially joining the ruling class of the planter elite in what had become the slave society of Virginia    Sixteen years old  he began forming a close relationship with his maternal uncle  the influential Judge Joseph Jones   who had been educated at the Inns of Court in London and was the executor of his father s estate  That same year  Monroe enrolled in the College of William and Mary   At the time  most students were charged with excitement over the prospect of rebellion against King George III    In early 1776  about a year and a half after his enrollment  Monroe dropped out of college and joined the 3rd Virginia Regiment  established December 28  1775  in the Continental Army where his background as a college student and the son of a well known planter enabled him to obtain an officer s commission  He never returned to earn a degree    In June 1775  after the battles of Lexington and Concord  Monroe  and some other William and Mary students joined 24 older men in raiding the arsenal at the Governor s Palace in Williamsburg  They used the loot of 200 muskets and 300 swords to arm the Williamsburg militia    Although Andrew Jackson served as a courier in a militia unit at age thirteen  Monroe is regarded as the last U S  President who was a Revolutionary War veteran  since he served as an officer of the Continental Army and took part in combat    With the rest of Washington s army  Monroe s regiment was chased off Long Island in the fall of 1776 and down the length of New Jersey crossing the Delaware River in December 1776  Down to mere days before their enlistments expired  the Army s commander  General Washington decided that only a bold step could save the Army and the revolutionary cause from oblivion  Washington ordered his force  that had shrunk 90  since the Battle of Brooklyn which is also known by the wider name  Battle of Long Island   and down to under 3 000 effective soldiers  to cross the Delaware River on Christmas Day 1776 in the Battle of Trenton   Monroe and his regiment crossed over and marched through a Nor easter snow storm north and then east towards Trenton  Along the way  the soldiers were spotted by a young patriot doctor  John Riker  whose dogs had been awakened in the pre dawn early morning  Riker volunteered to lend his medical bag to the efforts saying that as many doctors as possible would be needed fearing severe casualties from a clash with the battle tested German speaking Hessian professional mercenary soldiers  Avoiding detection  the Americans approached the center of Trenton from north and south  When the Hessians sounded the alarm  they tried to get several of their artillery pieces in action to pour grapeshot into the Americans marching down towards the homes they had commandeered  Knowing that this would slow the assault  after a volley of artillery fire  Lieutenant Monroe and General Washington s cousin  Captain William Washington and their men rushed to seize the guns before they could fire  Both young officers were severely wounded  Captain Washington was badly wounded in both hands  and young Lieutenant James Monroe was carried from the field bleeding badly after he was struck in the left shoulder by a musket ball  which severed an artery  It would be the young volunteer doctor  John Riker who clamped the artery  keeping him from bleeding to death and saving the life of a man who would go on to achieve so much in politics both as a Virginian and on the national stage as a future President    The wounded soldier  Monroe was sent home to Virginia to nurse his injuries  The Battle of Trenton would be Monroe s only battle as he would spend the next three months recuperating from his wound  In John Trumbull  s painting Capture of the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton   Monroe can be seen lying wounded at left center of the painting  In the famous painting  Washington Crossing the Delaware   Monroe is depicted holding the American flag     After recuperating from his wound  he was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia  and tasked to recruit and lead a regiment  but the regiment was never raised  He returned to Williamsburg in September of 1779 and studied law with George Wythe   and then moved to Richmond to study law with Thomas Jefferson  In 1780 the British invaded Richmond  and as Governor   Jefferson commissioned Monroe as a colonel to command the militia raised in response and act as liaison to the Continental Army in North Carolina       Monroe resumed studying law under Jefferson   and continued until 1783      Monroe was not particularly interested in legal theory or practice  but chose to take it up because he thought that it offered  the most immediate rewards  and could ease his path to wealth  social standing  and political influence    After passing the bar  he practiced law in Fredericksburg  Virginia      James Monroe married Elizabeth Kortright  17681830     daughter of Laurence Kortright and Hannah Aspinwall Kortright  on February 16  1786  in New York City  He had met her while serving with the Continental Congress  which then met in New York  the temporary capital of the new nation  After a brief honeymoon on Long Island  New York   the Monroes returned to New York City to live with her father until Congress adjourned  The Monroes had the following children   Monroe sold his small inherited Virginia plantation in 1783 to enter law and politics  Monroe later fulfilled his youthful dream of becoming the owner of a large plantation and wielding great political power  but his plantation was never profitable  Although he owned much more land and slaves and speculated in property  he was rarely on site to oversee the operations  Overseers treated the slaves harshly to force production  but the plantations barely broke even  Monroe incurred debts by his lavish and expensive lifestyle and often sold property  including slaves  to pay them off     Monroe was a wealthy Loudoun County plantation owner who owned numerous slave plantations including Oak Hill in Aldie     Monroe was an absentee slaveholder in that he had his overseers run the plantations while he lived elsewhere    Overseers moved or separated slave families from different Monroe plantations in accordance with production and maintenance needs of each satellite plantation    One of Monroe s slaves named Daniel often ran away from Monroe s plantation in Albermarle County   to visit other slaves or separated family members    Monroe commonly referred to Daniel as a  scoundrel  and described the  worthlessness  of Daniel as a runaway slave    Monroe s practice of moving and separating slave families was common treatment of slaves in the South     Monroe was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1782  He was elected to Congress in November 1783 and served in Annapolis until Congress left for Trenton in June 1784  He had served a total of three years when he finally retired from that office by the rule of rotation    By that time  the government was meeting in the temporary capital of New York City    In Virginia  the struggle in 1788 over the ratification of the proposed Constitution involved more than a simple clash between federalists and anti federalists  Virginians held a full spectrum of opinions about the merits of the proposed change in national government  George Washington and James Madison were leading supporters  Patrick Henry and George Mason were leading opponents  Those who held the middle ground in the ideological struggle became the central figures  Led by Monroe and Edmund Pendleton   these  federalists who are for amendments   criticized the absence of a bill of rights and worried about surrendering taxation powers to the central government  Virginia ratified the Constitution in June 1788  largely because Monroe  Pendleton and followers suspended their reservations and vowed to press for changes after the new government had been established     Virginia narrowly ratified the Constitution  Monroe ran for a House seat in the First Congress but was defeated by Madison  In 1790 he was elected by the Virginia legislature as United States Senator   He soon joined the  Democratic Republican  faction led by Jefferson and Madison  and by 1791 was the party leader in the Senate     Monroe resigned his Senate seat after being appointed Minister to France in 1794    As ambassador  Monroe secured the release of Thomas Paine in revolutionary France after his arrest for opposition to the execution of Louis XVI   The government insisted that Paine be deported to the United States     Monroe arranged to free all the Americans held in French prisons  He also gained the freedom of Adrienne de La Fayette and issued her and her family American passports  they had been granted citizenship by the U S  government for contributions during the Revolution   She used that for travel to her husband   imprisoned in Olmutz      A strong friend of the French Revolution   Monroe tried to assure France that George Washington  s policy of strict neutrality did not favor Britain  But American policy had come to favor Britain  and Monroe was stunned by the United States  signing of the Jay Treaty in London  With France and Britain at war  the Jay Treaty alarmed and angered the French  Washington had differences with Monroe and discharged him as Minister to France  claiming his  inefficiency  disruptive maneuvers  and failure to safeguard the interests of his country      Monroe had long been concerned about foreign influence on the presidency  He was alarmed by the Spanish diplomat Don Diego de Gardoqui   who in 1785 tried to convince Congress to allow Spain to close the Mississippi River to American traffic for 30 years  Spain controlled much of the Mississippi since taking over former French territory  including the important port of New Orleans  Monroe thought that Spain could have endangered the U S  retention of its Southwest and caused the dominance of the Northeast    Monroe believed in both a strong presidency and the system of checks and balances   In the 1790s he fretted over an aging George Washington being too much influenced by close advisers such as Alexander Hamilton   whom Monroe thought too close to Britain  He was humiliated by Washington s criticism for his support of revolutionary France as minister to the nation     Out of office  Monroe returned to practicing law in Virginia until elected governor there as a Democratic Republican  his first term serving from 1799 to 1802  He was reelected Virginia s governor in 1811    He called out the state militia to suppress Gabriel s Rebellion   Gabriel and 26 other enslaved people who participated were all hanged for treason  Monroe thought that foreign and Federalist elements had created the Quasi War of 17981800 and were behind efforts to prevent the election of Thomas Jefferson as president in 1800  As governor he considered using the Virginia militia to force the outcome in favor of Jefferson    Federalists were likewise suspicious of Monroe  some seeing him as at best a French dupe and at worst a traitor     President Jefferson sent Monroe to France to assist Robert R  Livingston in negotiating the Louisiana Purchase   Monroe was then appointed Minister to the Court of St  James s in London from 1803 to 1807  In 1806 he negotiated a treaty with Great Britain  known as the MonroePinkney Treaty   It would have extended the Jay Treaty of 1794 which had expired after ten years  Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 179495 because he felt it would allow the British to subvert American republicanism   The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants  but Jefferson was still hostile  When Monroe and the British signed a renewal in December 1806  Jefferson decided not to even submit it to the Senate for ratification  Although the new treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees that would have been good for business  Jefferson refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain and was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice of impressment of American sailors  Jefferson did not attempt to obtain another treaty  and as a result  the two nations drifted from peace toward the War of 1812     After the failure of the treaty  Monroe returned to the United States in 1807  Monroe was deeply hurt by the administration s repudiation of the treaty  and Monroe fell out with Secretary of State James Madison     The Democratic Republican Party was increasingly factionalized  with   Old Republicans   or  Quids  denouncing the Jefferson administration for abandoning true republican principles  The Quids  seeing that Monroe s foreign policy had been rejected by Jefferson  tried to enlist Monroe in their cause  The plan was to run Monroe for president in the 1808 election in cooperation with the Federalist Party   which had a strong base in New England  John Randolph of Roanoke led the Quid effort to stop Jefferson s choice of James Madison   However  the regular Democratic Republicans overcame the Quids in the nominating caucus  kept control of the party in Virginia  and protected Madison s base  Monroe was not a candidate for president  and Madison was elected    After the election Monroe quickly reconciled with Jefferson  but did not speak with Madison  a former friend  until 1810     Monroe returned to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was elected to another term as governor in 1811  but only served four months  In April 1811  Madison appointed Monroe as Secretary of State in hopes of shoring up the support of the more radical factions of the Democratic Republicans    Monroe had little to do with the War of 1812   as President Madison and the War Hawks in Congress were dominant  The war went very badly  and when the British burned the U S  Capitol and the White House on August 24  1814  Madison removed John Armstrong as Secretary of War and turned to Monroe for help  appointing him Secretary of War on September 27    Monroe resigned as Secretary of State on October 1  but no successor was ever appointed and thus from October 1  1814 to February 28  1815  Monroe effectively held both Cabinet posts  Monroe formulated plans for an offensive invasion of Canada to win the war  but a peace treaty was ratified in February 1815  before any armies moved north  Monroe therefore resigned as Secretary of War on March 15  1815 and was formally reappointed Secretary of State  Monroe stayed on at State until March 4  1817  when he began his term as the new President of the United States     The Congressional nominating caucus experienced little opposition during the administrations of Jefferson and Madison  but this situation changed in the election year of 1816  An indeterminate number of anti Virginia Republicans  led by the New York delegation  objected to the caucus system along with the Federalists  Disorganization and failure to agree on William H  Crawford   Daniel Tompkins   Henry Clay or another possible contender weakened opposition to Monroe  The boycott by Virginia delegates of the March 12 caucus removed the chances of Monroe s opponents  and he received the caucus nomination four days later    With the Federalist Party in disarray due to the unpopularity of their opposition to the War of 1812   Monroe easily won election    The Federalists did not even name a candidate  though Rufus King of New York did run in opposition to Monroe under the Federalist banner    King carried only Connecticut  Delaware  and Massachusetts and won only 34 of 217 electoral votes cast     The collapse of the Federalists left Monroe with no organized opposition at the end of his first term  and he ran for reelection unopposed    the only president other than Washington to do so  A single elector from New Hampshire cast a vote for John Quincy Adams   preventing a unanimous vote in the Electoral College      Monroe largely ignored old party lines in making appointments to lower posts  which reduced political tensions and enabled the   Era of Good Feelings    which lasted through his administration  He made two long national tours in 1817 to build national trust  Frequent stops on these tours allowed innumerable ceremonies of welcome and expressions of good will  The Federalist Party continued to fade away during his administration  it maintained its vitality and organizational integrity in Delaware and a few localities  but lacked influence in national politics  Lacking serious opposition  the Democratic Republican Party  s Congressional caucus stopped meeting  and for practical purposes the Democratic Republican Party stopped operating     Monroe s popularity remained undiminished even when he followed difficult nationalist policies at a time when the country s commitment to nationalism started to show serious fractures    citation needed   The Panic of 1819 caused a painful economic depression  The application for statehood in 1819 by the Missouri Territory as a slave state failed  An amended bill for gradually eliminating slavery in Missouri precipitated two years of bitter debate in Congress  The Missouri Compromise bill of 1820 resolved the struggle  pairing Missouri as a slave state with Maine   a free state  and barring slavery north of latitude 36 30  N forever  The Missouri Compromise lasted until 1854  when Stephen A  Douglas s Kansas Nebraska Act repealed it  In 1857 Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney held that it had always been unconstitutional  as part of the Dred Scott decision   Congress demanded high subsidies for internal improvements  such as for the improvement of the Cumberland Road   during Monroe s presidency    Monroe vetoed the Cumberland Road Bill   which provided for yearly improvements to the road  because he believed it to be unconstitutional for the government to have such a large hand in what was essentially a civics bill deserving of attention on a state by state basis  This defiance underlined Monroe s populist ideals and added credit to the local offices that he was so fond of visiting on his speech tours     Monroe sparked a constitutional controversy when  in 1817  he sent General Andrew Jackson to move against Spanish Florida to pursue hostile Seminole Indians and punish the Spanish for aiding them  News of Jackson s exploits ignited a congressional investigation of the 1st Seminole War  Dominated by Democratic Republicans  the 15th Congress was generally expansionist and more likely to support the popular Jackson  Ulterior political agendas of many congressmen dismantled partisan and sectional coalitions  so that Jackson s opponents argued weakly and became easily discredited  After much debate  the House of Representatives voted down all resolutions that condemned Jackson in any way  thus implicitly endorsing Monroe s actions and leaving the issue surrounding the role of the executive with respect to war powers unanswered     Monroe believed that the Indians must progress from the hunting stage to become an agricultural people  noting in 1817   A hunter or savage state requires a greater extent of territory to sustain it than is compatible with progress and just claims of civilised life     His proposals to speed up the assimilation process were ignored by Congress     Relations with Spain over the purchase of Spanish Florida proved to be troublesome  especially after Andrew Jackson invaded that territory on what he believed to be the president s authorization  which Monroe later denied giving  But largely through the skillful work of John Quincy Adams  a treaty was signed with Spain in 1819 that ceded Florida to the United States in return for the assumption of  5 000 000  about  92 592 593 in 2014 dollars  in claims and the relinquishment of any claims to Texas    Florida was ceded to the U S  in 1821   After the Napoleonic wars  which ended in 1815   almost all of Spain s and Portugal s colonies in Latin America revolted and declared independence  Americans welcomed this development as a validation of the spirit of Republicanism   Secretary of State John Quincy Adams suggested delaying formal recognition until Florida was secured  The problem of imperial invasion was intensified by a Russian claim to the Pacific coast down to the fifty first parallel and simultaneous European pressure to have all of Latin America returned to its colonial status    citation needed    Monroe informed Congress in March 1822 that permanent stable governments had been established in the United Provinces of the Ro de la Plata  the core of present day Argentina    Chile   Peru   Colombia and Mexico   Adams  under Monroe s supervision  wrote the instructions for the ministers  ambassadors  to these new countries  They declared that the policy of the United States was to uphold republican institutions and to seek treaties of commerce on a most favored nation basis  The United States would support inter American congresses dedicated to the development of economic and political institutions fundamentally differing from those prevailing in Europe  The articulation of an  American system  distinct from that of Europe was a basic tenet of Monroe s policy toward Latin America  Monroe took pride as the United States was the first nation to extend recognition and to set an example to the rest of the world for its support of the  cause of liberty and humanity     citation needed    Monroe formally announced in his message to Congress on December 2  1823  what was later called the Monroe Doctrine   He proclaimed that the Americas should be free from future European colonization and free from European interference in sovereign countries  affairs  It further stated the United States  intention to stay neutral in European wars and wars between European powers and their colonies  but to consider new colonies or interference with independent countries in the Americas as hostile acts toward the United States    citation needed    Although it is Monroe s most famous contribution to history  the speech was written by Adams  who designed the doctrine in cooperation with Britain    Monroe and Adams realized that American recognition would not protect the new countries against military intervention to restore Spain s power  In October 1823  Richard Rush   the American minister in London  advised that Foreign Secretary George Canning was proposing that the U S  and Britain jointly declare their opposition to European intervention  Britain  with its powerful navy  also opposed re conquest of Latin America and suggested that the United States join in proclaiming a  hands off  policy  Galvanized by the British initiative  Monroe consulted with American leaders and then formulated a plan with Adams  Ex Presidents Jefferson and Madison counseled Monroe to accept the offer  but Adams advised   It would be more candid     to avow our principles explicitly to Russia and France  than to come in as a cock boat in the wake of the British man of war   Monroe accepted Adams  advice  Not only must Latin America be left alone  he warned  but also Russia must not encroach southward on the Pacific coast      the American continents   he stated   by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain  are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European Power     citation needed    The Monroe Doctrine at the time of its adoption thus pertained more to the Russians in North America than to the former Spanish colonies  The result was a system of American isolationism under the sponsorship of the British navy  The Monroe Doctrine held that the United States considered the Western Hemisphere as no longer a place for European colonization  that any future effort to gain further political control in the hemisphere or to violate the independence of existing states would be treated as an act of hostility  and finally that there existed two different and incompatible political systems in the world  The United States  therefore  promised to refrain from intervention in European affairs and demanded Europe to abstain from interfering with American matters  There were few serious European attempts at intervention     Monroe made balanced Cabinet choices  naming a southerner  John C  Calhoun   as Secretary of War  and a northerner  John Quincy Adams   as Secretary of State  Both proved outstanding  as Adams was a master diplomat   and Calhoun completely reorganized the War Department to overcome the serious deficiencies that had hobbled it during the War of 1812    Monroe decided on political grounds not to offer Henry Clay the State Department  and Clay turned down the War Department and remained Speaker of the House  so Monroe lacked an outstanding westerner in his cabinet   Monroe appointed one Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States   Smith Thompson   He appointed 21 other federal judges  all to United States district courts   as no vacancies occurred on the one circuit court existing at the time   When his presidency ended on March 4  1825  James Monroe resided at Monroe Hill   what is now included in the grounds of the University of Virginia   He had operated the family farm from 1788 to 1817  but sold it in the first year of his presidency to the new college  He served on the college s Board of Visitors under Jefferson and under the second rector James Madison   both former presidents  almost until his death   Monroe had racked up many debts during his years of public life  He sold off his Highland Plantation  now called Ash Lawn Highland    It is now owned by his alma mater   the College of William and Mary   which has opened it to the public as an historic site  Throughout his life  he was not financially solvent  and his wife s poor health made matters worse     He and his wife lived in Oak Hill   Virginia  until Elizabeth s death on September 23  1830  In August 1825  the Monroes had received the Marquis de Lafayette and President John Quincy Adams as guests there     Upon Elizabeth s death in 1830  Monroe moved to New York City to live with his daughter Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur who had married Samuel L  Gouverneur in the White House  Monroe s health began to slowly fail by the end of the 1820s and John Quincy Adams visited him there in April 1831    Adams found him alert and eager to discuss the situation in Europe  but in ill health  Adams cut the visit short when he thought he was tiring Monroe   Monroe died there from heart failure and tuberculosis on July 4  1831  thus becoming the third president to have died on Independence Day   July 4  His death came 55 years after the U S  Declaration of Independence was proclaimed and 5 years after the death of two other Founding Fathers who became Presidents  John Adams and Thomas Jefferson   Monroe was originally buried in New York at the Gouverneur family s vault in the New York City Marble Cemetery   Twenty seven years later  in 1858  the body was re interred to the President s Circle at the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond  Virginia   The James Monroe Tomb is a U S  National Historic Landmark     When it comes to Monroe s thoughts on religion   Bliss Isely notes   less is known than that of any other President   No letters survive in which he discussed his religious beliefs  Nor did his friends  family or associates comment on his beliefs  Letters that do survive  such as ones written after the death of his son  contain no discussion of religion     Monroe was raised in a family that belonged to the Church of England when it was the state church in Virginia before the Revolution  As an adult  he frequently attended Episcopal churches  though there is no record he ever took communion    citation needed   Some historians see  deistic tendencies  in his few references to an impersonal God    Unlike Jefferson  Monroe was rarely attacked as an atheist or infidel  In 1832 James Renwick Willson   a Reformed Presbyterian minister in Albany  New York  criticized Monroe for having  lived and died like a second rate Athenian philosopher      As Secretary of State  Monroe dismissed Mordecai Manuel Noah in 1815 from his post as consul to Tunis because he was Jewish    Noah protested and gained letters from Adams  Jefferson  and Madison supporting church state separation and tolerance for Jews     Monroe may have believed in an interactive God for he said    If we persevere   we can not fail  under the favor of a gracious Providence   My fervent prayers to the Almighty that He will be graciously pleased to continue to us that protection which He has already so conspicuously displayed in our favor      Monroe owned dozens of slaves   According to William Seale  he took several slaves with him to Washington to serve at the White House from 1817 to 1825  This was typical of other slaveholders  as Congress did not provide for domestic staff of the presidents at that time     On October 15  1799  as some slave traders tried to transport a group of slaves from Southampton to Georgia  the slaves revolted and killed the traders    According to Scheer s article on the subject  a nearby slave patrol responded and killed ten slaves on the spot in extrajudicial killings without the benefit of trial  Of the initial group  the patrol took five slaves alive  They were tried in an oyer and terminer court without the benefit of a jury    and four were convicted   The fifth pleaded benefit of clergy and was flogged and branded   Governor Monroe postponed the slaves  executions to check their identities  he granted a pardon to one  and allowed two to hang  The fourth died in jail from exposure to the cold  Scheer says that Monroe  help ed  secure a modicum of civil protection for slaves sentenced to death for capital crimes      When Monroe was Governor of Virginia in 1800  hundreds of slaves from Virginia planned to kidnap him  take Richmond   and negotiate for their freedom  Due to a storm on August 30  they were unable to attack  What became known as Gabriel s slave conspiracy became public knowledge     In response  Governor Monroe called out the militia  the slave patrols soon captured some slaves accused of involvement  Sidbury says some trials had a few measures to prevent abuses  such as an appointed attorney  but they were  hardly  fair    Slave codes prevented slaves from being treated like whites  and they were given quick trials without a jury    Monroe influenced the Executive Council to pardon and sell some slaves instead of hanging them    Historians say the Virginia courts executed between 26 and 35 slaves  None of the executed slaves had killed any whites because the uprising had been foiled before it began     As president of Virginia s constitutional convention in the fall of 1829  Monroe reiterated his belief that slavery was a blight which  even as a British colony  Virginia had attempted to eradicate   What was the origin of our slave population   he rhetorically asked   The evil commenced when we were in our Colonial state  but acts were passed by our Colonial Legislature  prohibiting the importation  of more slaves  into the Colony  These were rejected by the Crown   To the dismay of states  rights proponents  he was willing to accept the federal government s financial assistance to emancipate and transport freed slaves to other countries  At the convention  Monroe made his final public statement on slavery  proposing that Virginia emancipate and deport its bondsmen with  the aid of the Union      Monroe was part of the American Colonization Society formed in 1816  the members of which included Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson   They found common ground with some abolitionists in supporting colonization  They helped send several thousand freed slaves to the new colony of Liberia in Africa from 1820 to 1840  Slave owners like Monroe and Jackson wanted to prevent free blacks from encouraging slaves in the South to rebel  With about  100 000 in Federal grant money  the organization also bought land for the freedmen in what is today Liberia    The capital of Liberia was named Monrovia after President Monroe     Monroe was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in April 1818    ", "Lincoln": "Family and childhood Early life and

  e  b r   h  m   l     k  n    February 12  1809  April 15  1865  was the 16th President of the United States   serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865   Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War its bloodiest war and its greatest moral  constitutional  and political crisis      In doing so  he preserved the Union   abolished slavery  strengthened the federal government  and modernized the economy   Born in Hodgenville  Kentucky   Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana   Largely self educated  he became a lawyer in Illinois   a Whig Party leader   and a member of the Illinois House of Representatives   where he served from 1834 to 1846  Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846  Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks  tariffs  and railroads  Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress  and because his opposition to the MexicanAmerican War was unpopular among Illinois voters  Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed his successful law practice  Reentering politics in 1854  he became a leader in building the new Republican Party   which had a statewide majority in Illinois  In 1858  while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival  Democrat Stephen A  Douglas   Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery  but lost the U S  Senate race to Douglas   In 1860  Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state  With very little support in the slaveholding states of the South  he swept the North and was elected president in 1860   His victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House   no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession  Subsequently  on April 12  1861  a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union in a declaration of war  As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party  Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans  who demanded harsher treatment of the South  War Democrats   who called for more compromise  anti war Democrats  called Copperheads    who despised him  and irreconcilable secessionists  who plotted his assassination  Politically  Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other  by carefully planned political patronage   and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory    His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism  republicanism  equal rights  liberty  and democracy   Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war  His primary goal was to reunite the nation  He suspended habeas corpus   leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision  and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861  Lincoln closely supervised the war effort  especially the selection of top generals  including his most successful general  Ulysses S  Grant   He also made major decisions on Union war strategy  including a naval blockade that shut down the South s normal trade  moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee  and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system  Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond   each time a general failed  Lincoln substituted another  until finally Grant succeeded  As the war progressed  his complex moves toward ending slavery began with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863  subsequently  Lincoln used the U S  Army to protect escaped slaves  encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery  and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution   which permanently outlawed slavery   An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state  Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re election campaign in the 1864 presidential election   Anticipating the war s conclusion  Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction   seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness  On April 14  1865  five days after the April 9th surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E  Lee   Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth   a Confederate sympathizer   Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars   and the public   as one of the three greatest U S  presidents     Abraham Lincoln was born February 12  1809  the second child of Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln   in a one room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm in Hardin County   Kentucky    now LaRue County    He is a descendant of Samuel Lincoln   who migrated from Norfolk   England to Hingham   Massachusetts  in 1638  Samuel s grandson and great grandson began the family s western migration  which passed through New Jersey   Pennsylvania   and Virginia       Lincoln s paternal grandfather and namesake  Captain Abraham Lincoln   moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County  Kentucky in the 1780s    Captain Lincoln was killed in an Indian raid in 1786  His children  including six year old Thomas  the future president s father  witnessed the attack      After his father s murder  Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier  working at odd jobs in Kentucky and in Tennessee   before settling with members of his family in Hardin County  Kentucky  in the early 1800s       Lincoln s mother  Nancy  was the daughter of Lucy Shipley Hanks  and was born in what is now Mineral County   West Virginia  then part of Virginia  The identity of Lincoln s maternal grandfather is unclear    According to William Ensign Lincoln s book The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln   Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks    however  the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock  Lucy Hanks migrated to Kentucky with her daughter  Nancy  The two women resided with relatives in Washington County  Kentucky       Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12  1806  in Washington County  and moved to Elizabethtown  Kentucky   following their marriage    They became the parents of three children  Sarah  born on February 10  1807  Abraham  on February 12  1809  and another son  Thomas  who died in infancy    Thomas Lincoln bought or leased several farms in Kentucky  including the Sinking Spring farm  where Abraham was born  however  a land title dispute soon forced the Lincolns to move      In 1811 the family relocated eight miles north  to Knob Creek Farm   where Thomas acquired title to 230 acres  93ha  of land  In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm    Of the 816 5 acres that Thomas held in Kentucky  he lost all but 200 acres  81ha  of his land in court disputes over property titles    Frustrated over the lack of security provided by Kentucky courts  Thomas sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814  and began planning a move to Indiana   where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure     In 1816 the family moved north across the Ohio River to Indiana   a free  non slaveholding territory  where they settled in an  unbroken forest    in Hurricane Township  Perry County    Their land in southern Indiana became part of Spencer County  Indiana   when the county was established in 1818       The farm is preserved as part of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial   In 1860 Lincoln noted that the family s move to Indiana was  partly on account of slavery   but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky      During the family s years in Kentucky and Indiana  Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer  cabinetmaker  and carpenter    He owned farms  several town lots and livestock  paid taxes  sat on juries  appraised estates  served on country slave patrols  and guarded prisoners  Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a Separate Baptists church  which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol  dancing  and slavery    Within a year of the family s arrival in Indiana  Thomas claimed title to 160 acres  65ha  of Indiana land  Despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to 80 acres  32ha  of land in what became known as the Little Pigeon Creek Community in Spencer County    Prior to the family s move to Illinois in 1830  Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property     Several significant family events took place during Lincoln s youth in Indiana  On October 5  1818  Nancy Lincoln died of milk sickness   leaving eleven year old Sarah in charge of a household that included her father  nine year old Abraham  and Dennis Hanks  Nancy s nineteen year old orphaned cousin    On December 2  1819  Lincoln s father married Sarah  Sally  Bush Johnston   a widow from Elizabethtown  Kentucky  with three children of her own    Abraham became very close to his stepmother  whom he referred to as  Mother       Those who knew Lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister Sarah s death on January 20  1828  while giving birth to a stillborn son       As a youth  Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life  Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his  reading  scribbling  writing  ciphering  writing Poetry  etc          and must have done it to avoid manual labor  His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy  physical labor   but loved to read    Lincoln was largely self educated  His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent  the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year  however  he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning      Family  neighbors  and schoolmates of Lincoln s youth recalled that he read and reread the King James Bible   Aesop s Fables   Bunyan  s The Pilgrim s Progress   Defoe  s Robinson Crusoe   Weems s The Life of Washington   and Franklin  s Autobiography   among others           As he grew into his teens  Lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household  He also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty one    Abraham became adept at using an axe  Tall for his age  Lincoln was also strong and athletic    He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as  the Clary s Grove boys      In early March 1830  fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River  the Lincoln family moved west to Illinois  a non slaveholding state  They settled on a site in Macon County  Illinois   10 miles  16km  west of Decatur       Historians disagree on who initiated the move    After the family relocated to Illinois  Abraham became increasingly distant from his father    in part because of his father s lack of education  and occasionally lent him money    In 1831  as Thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County  Illinois   Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own    Traveling down the Sangamon River   he ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County     Later that spring  Denton Offutt   a New Salem merchant  hired Lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon  Illinois  and Mississippi rivers  After arriving in New Orleansand witnessing slavery firsthandLincoln returned to New Salem  where he remained for the next six years       Lincoln s first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge   whom he met when he first moved to New Salem  by 1835  they were in a relationship but not formally engaged  She died at the age of 22 on August 25  1835  most likely of typhoid fever     In the early 1830s  he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister     Late in 1836  Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem  Mary did return in November 1836  and Lincoln courted her for a time  however  they both had second thoughts about their relationship  On August 16  1837  Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship  She never replied and the courtship ended     In 1840  Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd   who was from a wealthy slave holding family in Lexington   Kentucky    They met in Springfield   Illinois  in December 1839   and were engaged the following December    A wedding set for January 1  1841  was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln s initiative      They later met again at a party and married on November 4  1842  in the Springfield mansion of Mary s married sister    While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again  Lincoln  when asked where he was going  replied   To hell  I suppose      In 1844  the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln s law office  Mary Todd Lincoln kept house  often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl    Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln  Eddie  in 1846  Lincoln  was remarkably fond of children     and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children     Edward died on February 1  1850  in Springfield  probably of tuberculosis   Willie  Lincoln was born on December 21  1850  and died of a fever on February 20  1862  The Lincolns  fourth son  Thomas  Tad  Lincoln   was born on April 4  1853  and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16  1871    Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children  His last descendant  great grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith   died in 1985     The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents  Later in life  Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons  and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875    Abraham Lincoln suffered from   melancholy    a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression      Lincoln s father in law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders  Lincoln was close to the Todds  and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington    He was an affectionate  though often absent  husband and father of four children   In 1832  at age 23  Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem   Illinois    Although the economy was booming in the region  the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share  That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly   He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem  though he lacked an education  powerful friends  and money  which may be why he lost  He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River       Before the election  Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War     Following his return  Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly  At 6feet 4inches  193cm     he was tall and  strong enough to intimidate any rival   At his first speech  when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked  Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his  neck and the seat of his trousers  and threw him    Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates  the top four were elected   though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct     Lincoln served as New Salem s postmaster and later as county surveyor  all the while reading voraciously  He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone  s Commentaries on the Laws of England and other law books  Of his learning method  Lincoln stated   I studied with nobody     His second campaign in 1834 was successful  He won election to the state legislature  though he ran as a Whig   many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent     Admitted to the bar in 1836    he moved to Springfield  Illinois  and began to practice law under John T  Stuart   Mary Todd s cousin    Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross examinations and closing arguments  He partnered with Stephen T  Logan from 1841 until 1844  Then Lincoln began his practice with William Herndon   whom Lincoln thought  a studious young man      Successful on his second run for office  Lincoln served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County    He supported the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal   which he remained involved with later as a Canal Commissioner    In the 183536 legislative session  he voted to expand suffrage to white males  whether landowners or not    He was known for his  free soil  stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism   He first articulated this in 1837  saying    The  Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy  but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils     His stance closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa     From the early 1830s  Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be   an old line Whig  a disciple of Henry Clay     The party  including Lincoln  favored economic modernization in banking  protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads  and espoused urbanization as well     In 1846  Lincoln was elected to the U S  House of Representatives   where he served one two year term  He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation  but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line    Lincoln  in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R  Giddings   wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners  enforcement to capture fugitive slaves  and a popular vote on the matter  He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters     On foreign and military policy  Lincoln spoke out against the MexicanAmerican War   which he attributed to President Polk  s desire for  military glorythat attractive rainbow  that rises in showers of blood     Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso   which  if it had been adopted  would have banned slavery in any U S  territory won from Mexico     Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions   The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U S  Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had  invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil         Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil     Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it  the national papers ignored it  and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district  One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him  spotty Lincoln         Lincoln later regretted some of his statements  especially his attack on the presidential war making powers     Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency  Lincoln  who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House  supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election     Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office   but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival  Justin Butterfield   considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer  but in Lincoln s view  an  old fossil     The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory   This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold  and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois  so he declined and resumed his law practice     Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield  handling  every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer     Twice a year for 16 years  10 weeks at a time  he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session    Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation s western expansion  particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges  As a riverboat man  Lincoln initially favored those interests  but ultimately represented whoever hired him    In fact  he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge      In 1849  he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water  The idea was never commercialized  but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent       In 1851  he represented the Alton   Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders  James A  Barret  who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route      Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of Barret s pledge  the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer  superior  and less expensive route  and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret s payment  The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation    Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases  in 51 as sole counsel  of which 31 were decided in his favor    From 1853 to 1860  another of Lincoln s largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad     Lincoln s reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname  Honest Abe      Lincoln s most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William  Duff  Armstrong   who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker    The case is famous for Lincoln s use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness  After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight  Lincoln produced a Farmers  Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle  drastically reducing visibility  Based on this evidence  Armstrong was acquitted     Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom  but in an 1859 case  where he defended a cousin  Peachy Harrison  who was accused of stabbing another to death  Lincoln angrily protested the judge s decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client  Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected  the judge  a Democrat  reversed his ruling  allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison       By the 1850s  slavery was still legal in the southern United States  but had been generally outlawed in the northern states  including Illinois  whose original 1818 Constitution forbade slavery  as required by the Northwest Ordinance     Lincoln disapproved of slavery  and the spread of slavery to new U S  territory in the west    He returned to politics to oppose the pro slavery KansasNebraska Act  1854   this law repealed the slavery restricting Missouri Compromise  1820   Senior Senator Stephen A  Douglas of Illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the Act  Douglas  provision  which Lincoln opposed  specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U S  territory  rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress     Eric Foner  2010  contrasts the abolitionists and anti slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin  with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress  Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle  opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers   especially the equality of all men and democratic self government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence      On October 16  1854  in his   Peoria Speech    Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery  which he repeated en route to the presidency    Speaking in his Kentucky accent  with a very powerful voice    he said the Kansas Act had a   declared indifference  but as I must think  a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery  I cannot but hate it  I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself  I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world        In late 1854  Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U S  Senate seat from Illinois  At that time  senators were elected by the state legislature    After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly  his support began to dwindle  and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull   who defeated opponent Joel Aldrich Matteson     The Whigs had been irreparably split by the KansasNebraska Act  Lincoln wrote   I think I am a Whig  but others say there are no Whigs  and that I am an abolitionist       I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery      Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party  and on disenchanted Free Soil   Liberty   and Democratic Party members  he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party     At the 1856 Republican National Convention   Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party s candidate for vice president     In 18571858  Douglas broke with President James Buchanan   leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party  Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858  since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution   which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state     In March 1857  the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dred Scott v  Sandford   Chief Justice Roger B  Taney opined that blacks were not citizens  and derived no rights from the Constitution  Lincoln denounced the decision  alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power     Lincoln argued   The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended  to say all were equal in color  size  intellect  moral developments  or social capacity   but they  did consider all men created equalequal in certain inalienable rights  among which are life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness       After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U S  Senate in 1858  Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech   drawing on Mark 3 25    A house divided against itself cannot stand  I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free  I do not expect the Union to be dissolvedI do not expect the house to fallbut I do expect it will cease to be divided  It will become all one thing  or all the other     The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate  and rallied Republicans across the North    The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would  in turn  select Lincoln or Douglas as its U S  senator     The Senate campaign featured the seven LincolnDouglas debates of 1858  the most famous political debates in American history    The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically  Lincoln warned that   The Slave Power   was threatening the values of republicanism  and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal   while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine   that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not  and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists    The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands  Lincoln stated Douglas  popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation s morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states  Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U S  Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision     Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes  the Democrats won more seats  and the legislature re elected Douglas to the Senate  Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln  his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation    In May 1859  Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats Anzeiger  a German language newspaper which was consistently supportive  most of the state s 130 000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German language paper could mobilize     On February 27  1860  New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans  Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery  Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery  and rejected any  groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong     Despite his inelegant appearancemany in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly   Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination  Journalist Noah Brooks reported   No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience        Historian Donald described the speech as a  superb political move for an unannounced candidate  to appear in one rival s   William H  Seward   own state at an event sponsored by the second rival s   Salmon P  Chase   loyalists  while not mentioning either by name during its delivery     In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions  Lincoln said   The taste is in my mouth a little      On May 910  1860  the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur    Lincoln s followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis   Norman Judd   Leonard Swett   and Jesse DuBois  and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency    Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father  clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax   Lincoln s supporters adopted the label of  The Rail Candidate      On May 18  at the Republican National Convention in Chicago  Lincoln s friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot  beating candidates such as William H  Seward and Salmon P  Chase  A former Democrat  Hannibal Hamlin of Maine  was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket  Lincoln s success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue  and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff     On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top  Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs    Lincoln s managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others  while following Lincoln s strong dictate to  Make no contracts that bind me      Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party  as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan  Throughout the 1850s  Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war  and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession    Meanwhile  Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats  Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the Democratic convention   disagreeing with Douglas  position on popular sovereignty  and ultimately selected John C  Breckinridge as their candidate     As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns  Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches  Instead  he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party  The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North  and produced an abundance of campaign posters  leaflets  and newspaper editorials  There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform  and second on Lincoln s life story  emphasizing his childhood poverty  The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of  free labor   whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts    The Republican Party s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition  a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln s life  and sold 100 000 to 200 000 copies     On November 6  1860  Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States  beating Democrat Stephen A  Douglas  John C  Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats  and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party   He was the first president from the Republican Party  His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West  no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states  and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states     Lincoln received 1 866 452 votes  Douglas 1 376 957 votes  Breckinridge 849 781 votes  and Bell 588 789 votes  Turnout was 82 2percent  with Lincoln winning the free Northern states  as well as California and Oregon  Douglas won Missouri  and split New Jersey with Lincoln    Bell won Virginia  Tennessee  and Kentucky  and Breckinridge won the rest of the South     Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote  his victory in the electoral college was decisive  Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123  There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln s opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York  New Jersey  and Rhode Island  but even if the anti Lincoln vote had been combined in every state  Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College     As Lincoln s election became evident  secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March    On December 20  1860  South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession  by February 1  1861  Florida  Mississippi  Alabama  Georgia  Louisiana  and Texas followed      Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation  the Confederate States of America     The upper South and border states  Delaware  Maryland  Virginia  North Carolina  Tennessee  Kentucky  Missouri  and Arkansas  listened to  but initially rejected  the secessionist appeal    President Buchanan and President elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy  declaring secession illegal    The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9  1861     There were attempts at compromise  The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820  dividing the territories into slave and free  contrary to the Republican Party s free soil platform    Lincoln rejected the idea  saying   I will suffer death before I consent    to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right      Lincoln  however  did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution  which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states  That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent      A few weeks before the war  Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution    Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution     En route to his inauguration by train  Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North    The president elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore  who were uncovered by Lincoln s head of security  Allan Pinkerton   On February 23  1861  he arrived in disguise in Washington  D C   which was placed under substantial military guard    Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South  proclaiming once again that he had no intention  or inclination  to abolish slavery in the Southern states   Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered  There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension  Indeed  the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection  It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you  I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that  I have no purpose  directly or indirectly  to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists  I believe I have no lawful right to do so  and I have no inclination to do so    The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South   We are not enemies  but friends  We must not be enemies    The mystic chords of memory  stretching from every battlefield  and patriot grave  to every living heart and hearthstone  all over this broad land  will yet swell the chorus of the Union  when again touched  as surely they will be  by the better angels of our nature     The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible  By March 1861  no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms  Meanwhile  Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated    Lincoln said as the war was ending   The commander of Fort Sumter  South Carolina  Major Robert Anderson   sent a request for provisions to Washington  and the execution of Lincoln s order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war  On April 12  1861  Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter   forcing them to surrender  and began the war  Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations  underestimating the gravity of the crisis  exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South  and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion     William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was  sadly disappointed  at his failure to realize that  the country was sleeping on a volcano  and that the South was preparing for war    Donald concludes that   His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft  Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood  But he also vowed not to surrender the forts  The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot  they did just that      On April 15  Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75 000 troops to recapture forts  protect Washington  and  preserve the Union   which  in his view  still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states  This call forced the states to choose sides  Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital  despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines  North Carolina  Tennessee  and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months  Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland  but did not prevail  Kentucky tried to be neutral    The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the Mason Dixon line to the defense of the American nation  Historian Allan Nevins says   States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincoln s call to save the capital and confront the rebellion  On April 19  mobs in Baltimore  which controlled the rail links  attacked Union troops who were changing trains  and local leaders  groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital  The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials  Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington    John Merryman   a Maryland official involved in hindering the U S  troop movements  petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander  Roger B  Taney   author of the controversial pro slavery Dred Scott opinion  to issue a writ of habeas corpus  and in June Taney  acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court  issued the writ  because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ  Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling       After the Battle of Fort Sumter   Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion  Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis  and he responded as commander in chief   using unprecedented powers  He expanded his war powers  and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports  disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress  and after suspending habeas corpus   arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers  Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions  In addition  Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict     The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln  and dominated his time and attention  From the start  it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort  and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle  such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army  Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue  Conversely  the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery    On August 6  1861  Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort  In practice  the law had little effect  but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy     In late August 1861  General John C  Frmont   the 1856 Republican presidential nominee  issued  without consulting his superiors in Washington  a proclamation of martial law in Missouri  He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court martialed and shot  and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed  Frmont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption  Lincoln overruled Frmont s proclamation  Lincoln believed that Fremont s emancipation was political  neither militarily necessary nor legal    After Lincoln acted  Union enlistments from Maryland  Kentucky  and Missouri increased by over 40 000 troops     The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain  The U S  Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship  the Trent   on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys  Britain protested vehemently while the U S  cheered  Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain    Lincoln s foreign policy approach had been initially hands off  due to his inexperience  he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State  William Seward  Seward s initial reaction to the Trent affair  however  was too bellicose  so Lincoln also turned to Senator Charles Sumner   the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy     To learn technical military terms  Lincoln borrowed and studied Henry Halleck  s book  Elements of Military Art and Science from the Library of Congress     Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the War Department in Washington  D C  He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort  consulted with governors  and selected generals based on their past success  as well as their state and party   In January 1862  after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department  Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary   Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction  Nevertheless  he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official   Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together   say Thomas and Hyman     In terms of war strategy  Lincoln articulated two priorities  to ensure that Washington was well defended  and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt  decisive victory  major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days    Twice a week  Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon  and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard    Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General Henry Halleck  a student of the European strategist Jomini   of the critical need to control strategic points  such as the Mississippi River    he also knew well the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy s army  rather than simply capturing territory     After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861  Lincoln appointed Major General George B  McClellan general in chief of all the Union armies    McClellan  a young West Point graduate  railroad executive  and Pennsylvania Democrat  took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign   longer than Lincoln wanted  The campaign s objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital  McClellan s repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress  as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington  Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan s troops in defense of the capital  McClellan  who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops  blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign     Lincoln removed McClellan as general in chief and appointed Henry Wager Halleck in March 1862  after McClellan s  Harrison s Landing Letter   in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort    McClellan s letter incensed Radical Republicans  who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope   a Republican  as head of the new Army of Virginia   Pope complied with Lincoln s strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north  thus protecting the capital from attack     However  lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan  now commanding the Army of the Potomac  Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862  forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time    The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia   formerly the USS Merrimack   damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk  Virginia  before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor   Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads      Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan s failure to reinforce Pope  Lincoln was desperate  and restored him to command of all forces around Washington  to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward    Two days after McClellan s return to command  General Robert E  Lee  s forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland  leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862    The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history  but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January  Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier  Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation     McClellan then resisted the President s demand that he pursue Lee s retreating and exposed army  while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee  As a result  Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans   and  after the 1862 midterm elections  he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside   Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander in Chief     Burnside  against the advice of the president  prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December  Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield  but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined  Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg    Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker   despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship     The mid term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war  as well as rising inflation  new high taxes  rumors of corruption  the suspension of habeas corpus  the military draft law   and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market  The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest  but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest     While Republicans were discouraged  Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania  Ohio  Indiana  and New York  The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states  except New York  The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were  depressed by the interminable nature of this war  as so far conducted  and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress      In the spring of 1863  Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together  these plans included Hooker s attack on Lee north of Richmond  Rosecrans  on Chattanooga  Grant s on Vicksburg  and a naval assault on Charleston     Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May    but continued to command his troops for some weeks  He ignored Lincoln s order to divide his troops  and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper s Ferry   and tendered his resignation  which Lincoln accepted  He was replaced by George Meade   who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign   which was a victory for the Union  though Lee s army avoided capture  At the same time  after initial setbacks  Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor    After the Battle of Gettysburg  Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general in chief on to his generals  who resented his civilian interference with their own plans  Even so  he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander in Chief     Lincoln understood that the Federal government s power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution  which before 1865  committed the issue to individual states  He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U S  territory  At the beginning of the war  he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery  Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it  as envisioned by the Founding Fathers   under the constitution    President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C  Frmont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862  on the grounds that it was not within their power  and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union     On June 19  1862  endorsed by Lincoln  Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory  In July 1862  the Second Confiscation Act was passed  which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion  Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress s power to free the slaves within the states  he approved the bill in deference to the legislature  He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander in Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution  and Lincoln was planning to take that action  In that month  Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet  In it  he stated that  as a fit and necessary military measure  on January 1  1863  all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward  and forever  be free      Privately  Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated  However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification  Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy    and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22  1862  Although he said he personally wished all men could be free  Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U S  president  he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his  official duty   was that of preserving the Union     My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union  and is not either to save or to destroy slavery  If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it  and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it  and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that  What I do about slavery  and the colored race  I do because I believe it helps to save the Union  and what I forbear  I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union       I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty  and I intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free     The Emancipation Proclamation  issued on September 22  1862  and put into effect on January 1  1863  declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control  with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states    Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation  while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites     Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective  as Union armies advanced south  more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed  Lincoln s comment on the signing of the Proclamation was   I never  in my life  felt more certain that I was doing right  than I do in signing this paper     For some time  Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves  He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation  but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed    A few days after Emancipation was announced  13 Republican governors met at the War Governors  Conference   they supported the president s Proclamation  but suggested the removal of General George B  McClellan as commander of the Union Army     Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation  By the spring of 1863  Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers  In a letter to Andrew Johnson   the military governor of Tennessee  encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops  Lincoln wrote   The bare sight of 50 000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once     By the end of 1863  at Lincoln s direction  General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley    Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln   In his company  I was never reminded of my humble origin  or of my unpopular color      With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863  and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall  Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort  despite the New York City draft riots   The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19  1863    Defying Lincoln s prediction that  the world will little note  nor long remember what we say here   the Address became the most quoted speech in American history     In 272 words  and three minutes  Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789  but in 1776   conceived in Liberty  and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal   He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all  The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort  He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain  that slavery would end as a result of the losses  and the future of democracy in the world would be assured  that  government of the people  by the people  for the people  shall not perish from the earth   Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective  a new birth of freedom in the nation       Meade s failure to capture Lee s army as it retreated from Gettysburg  and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac  persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed  General Ulysses S  Grant  s victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army  Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh  Lincoln had said   I can t spare this man  He fights     With Grant in command  Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters  and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops     Nevertheless  Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864  as McClellan was  Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant s political intentions  and being assured that he had none  submitted to the Senate Grant s promotion to commander of the Union Army  He obtained Congress s consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General  which no officer had held since George Washington     Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864  This is often characterized as a war of attrition   given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor   Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive  the Confederate forces had  almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces     The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North  Grant had lost a third of his army  and Lincoln asked what Grant s plans were  to which the general replied   I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer      The Confederacy lacked reinforcements  so Lee s army shrank with every costly battle  Grant s army moved south  crossed the James River   forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg  Virginia   Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant s headquarters at City Point  Virginia  This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities  as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina    Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North  and replaced the Union losses     Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructuresuch as plantations  railroads  and bridgeshoping to destroy the South s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting  Grant s move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South  This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia s Shenandoah Valley   The damage caused by Sherman s March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a 60 mile  97km  swath  but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal  but rather defeat of the Confederate armies  Mark E  Neely Jr  has argued that there was no effort to engage in   total war   against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II      vague    Confederate general Jubal Anderson Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital  During Early s raid on Washington  D C  in 1864  Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position  Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him   Get down  you damn fool  before you get shot     After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington  Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched     As Grant continued to wear down Lee s forces  efforts to discuss peace began  Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln  Seward  and others at Hampton Roads   Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal  his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results    On April 1  1865  Grant successfully outflanked Lee s forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg  and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond  Days later  when that city fell  Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital  as he walked through the city  white Southerners were stone faced  but freedmen greeted him as a hero  On April 9  Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over     While the war was still being waged  Lincoln faced reelection in 1864  Lincoln was a master politician  bringing togetherand holding togetherall the main factions of the Republican Party  and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M  Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well  Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powersgreatly expanded over peacetimeto hold the factions of his party together  build support for his own policies  and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket      At its 1864 convention  the Republican Party selected Johnson  a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee  as his running mate  To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans  Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party      When Grant s 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted  the lack of military success wore heavily on the President s re election prospects  and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated  Sharing this fear  Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that  if he should lose the election  he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House     This morning  as for some days past  it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re elected  Then it will be my duty to so co operate with the President elect  as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration  as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward     Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet  but asked them to sign the sealed envelope   While the Democratic platform followed the  Peace wing  of the party and called the war a  failure   their candidate  General George B  McClellan  supported the war and repudiated the platform  Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort  Sherman s capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut  s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters    the Democratic Party was deeply split  with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln  By contrast  the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue  and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads    On November 8  Lincoln was re elected in a landslide  carrying all but three states  and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers  vote       On March 4  1865  Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address   In it  he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God s will  Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks  among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world     Lincoln said   Fondly do we hopefervently do we praythat this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away  Yet  if God wills that it continue  until all the wealth piled by the bond man s 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk  and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash  shall be paid by another drawn with the sword  as was said 3 000 years ago  so still it must be said   the judgments of the Lord  are true and righteous altogether   With malice toward none  with charity for all  with firmness in the right  as God gives us to see the right  let us strive on to finish the work we are in  to bind up the nation s wounds  to care for him who shall have borne the battle  and for his widow  and his orphanto do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace  among ourselves  and with all nations     Reconstruction began during the war  as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states  and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves  Shortly after Lee s surrender  a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated  and Lincoln replied   Let  em up easy     In keeping with that sentiment  Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy  and was opposed by the Radical Republicans  under Rep  Thaddeus Stevens   Sen  Charles Sumner and Sen  Benjamin Wade   political allies of the president on other issues  Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South  Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war  His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8  1863  offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office  had not mistreated Union prisoners  and would sign an oath of allegiance     As Southern states were subdued  critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re formed  Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas  where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors  respectively  In Louisiana  Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P  Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it  Lincoln s Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans  political aspirations  On the other hand  the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient  and passed their own plan  the Wade Davis Bill   in 1864  When Lincoln vetoed the bill  the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana  Arkansas  and Tennessee     Lincoln s appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness  To fill Chief Justice Taney s seat on the Supreme Court  he named the choice of the Radicals  Salmon P  Chase  who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies     After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation  which did not apply to every state  Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment  Lincoln declared that such an amendment would  clinch the whole matter     By December 1863  a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage  This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass  falling short of the required two thirds majority on June 15  1864  in the House of Representatives  Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican Unionist platform in the election of 1864  After a long debate in the House  a second attempt passed Congress on January 31  1865  and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification      Upon ratification  it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6  1865     As the war drew to a close  Lincoln s presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux  having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen  He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner s Freedmen s Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves  The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen  Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction  Shortly before his assassination  Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction  Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short term military control over southern states  until readmission under the control of southern Unionists     Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived  but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen  Lincoln biographers James G  Randall and Richard Current   according to David Lincove  argue that   Eric Foner argues that   The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country  The term  the United States  has historically been used  sometimes in the plural   these United States    and other times in the singular  without any particular grammatical consistency  The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century     In recent years  historians such as Harry Jaffa  Herman Belz  John Diggins  Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln s redefinition of republican values   As early as the 1850s  a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution  Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political valueswhat he called the  sheet anchor  of republicanism    The Declaration s emphasis on freedom and equality for all  in contrast to the Constitution s tolerance of slavery  shifted the debate  As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860   Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself     His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism  rather than its legalisms    Nevertheless  in 1861  Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms  the Constitution was a contract  and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree   and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state    Burton  2008  argues that Lincoln s republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated     In March 1861  in Lincoln s first inaugural address   he explored the nature of democracy  He denounced secession as anarchy  and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system  He said  A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations  and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments  is the only true sovereign of a free people      Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency  which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them  Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress  the only important one was the Wade Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction    He signed the Homestead Act in 1862  making millions of acres of government held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost  The Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act   also signed in 1862  provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state  The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States  First Transcontinental Railroad   which was completed in 1869    The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s     Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government  tariffs  a policy with long precedent   and a new Federal income tax  In 1861  Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff   the first having become law under James Buchanan  Also in 1861  Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861   creating the first U S  income tax    This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above  800   21 000 in current dollar terms   which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure     Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government s economic influence in several other areas  The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country  It also established a national currency  In 1862  Congress created  with Lincoln s approval  the Department of Agriculture     In 1862  Lincoln sent a senior general  John Pope  to put down the   Sioux Uprising   in Minnesota  Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers  Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants  eventually approving 39 for execution  one was later reprieved     President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy     In the wake of Grant s casualties in his campaign against Lee  Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft  but it was never issued  In response to rumors of one  however  the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market  Lincoln s reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior  he ordered the military to seize the two papers  The seizure lasted for two days     Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States    Before Lincoln s presidency  Thanksgiving  while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century  had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates  The last such proclamation had been during James Madison  s presidency 50 years before  In 1863  Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving    In June 1864  Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress  which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park      Lincoln s declared philosophy on court nominations was that  we cannot ask a man what he will do  and if we should  and he should answer us  we should despise him for it  Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known     Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court  Noah Haynes Swayne   nominated January 21  1862 and appointed January 24  1862  was chosen as an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union  Samuel Freeman Miller   nominated and appointed on July 16  1862  supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist  David Davis  Lincoln s campaign manager in 1860  nominated December 1  1862 and appointed December 8  1862  had also served as a judge in Lincoln s Illinois court circuit  Stephen Johnson Field   a previous California Supreme Court justice  was nominated March 6  1863 and appointed March 10  1863  and provided geographic balance  as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat  Finally  Lincoln s Treasury Secretary  Salmon P  Chase  was nominated as Chief Justice  and appointed the same day  on December 6  1864  Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist  would support Reconstruction legislation  and that his appointment united the Republican Party     Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges  including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States   and 27 judges to the United States district courts   Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office   West Virginia   admitted to the Union June 20  1863  contained the former north westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union  As a condition for its admission  West Virginia s constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery  Nevada   which became the third State in the far west of the continent  was admitted as a free state on October 31  1864     John Wilkes Booth was a well known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland  though he never joined the Confederate army  he had contacts with the Confederate secret service    In 1864  Booth formulated a plan  very similar to one of Thomas N  Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy    to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners  After attending an April 11  1865  speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks  an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president    Learning that the President and Grant would be attending Ford s Theatre   Booth formulated a plan with co conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater  as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes  Without his main bodyguard  Ward Hill Lamon   Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14  At the last minute  Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play     Lincoln s bodyguard  John Parker  left Ford s Theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door  The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony  Seizing the opportunity  Booth crept up from behind and at about 10 13pm  aimed at the back of Lincoln s head and fired at point blank range  mortally wounding the President  Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth  but Booth stabbed him and escaped       After being on the run for 12 days  Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia  some 70 miles  110km  south of Washington  After refusing to surrender to Union troops  Booth was killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April 26       Doctor Charles Leale   an Army surgeon  found the President unresponsive  barely breathing and with no detectable pulse  Having determined that the President had been shot in the head  and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought  he made an attempt to clear the blood clot  after which the President began to breathe more naturally    The dying President was taken across the street to Petersen House   After remaining in a coma for nine hours  Lincoln died at 7 22am on April 15  Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said   Now he belongs to the ages      Lincoln s flag enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers  while the city s church bells rang  President Johnson was sworn in at 10 00am  less than 3 hours after Lincoln s death  The late President lay in state in the East Room  and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21  For his final journey with his son Willie  both caskets were transported in the executive coach  United States  and for three weeks the Lincoln Special funeral train decorated in black bunting   bore Lincoln s remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D C  to Springfield  Illinois  stopping at many cities across the North for large scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands  as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands  bonfires  and hymn singing     or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by  Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom d to eulogize Lincoln  one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president    Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow  but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news    African Americans were especially moved  they had lost  their Moses    In a larger sense  the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended     As a young man  Lincoln was a religious skeptic     or  in the words of a biographer  an iconoclast     Later in life  Lincoln s frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences  who were mostly evangelical Protestants    He never joined a church  although he frequently attended with his wife    However  he was deeply familiar with the Bible  and he both quoted and praised it    He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others  Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs  However he did believe in an all powerful God that shaped events and  by 1865  was expressing those beliefs in major speeches     In the 1840s  Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity  a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power    In the 1850s  Lincoln believed in  providence  in a general way  and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals  he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence    When he suffered the death of his son Edward  Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God    The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace    After Willie s death  Lincoln considered why  from a divine standpoint  the severity of the war was necessary  He wrote at this time that God  could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest  Yet the contest began  And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day  Yet the contest proceeds     On the day Lincoln was assassinated  he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land      Several claims abound that Lincoln s health was declining before the assassination  These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting  One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder MEN2b     which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma   mucosal neuromas and a Marfinoid appearance   Others simply claim he had Marfan s syndrome   based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers  and the association of possible aortic regurgitation   which can cause bobbing of the head   DeMusset s sign    based on blurring of Lincoln s head in photographs  which back then had a long exposure time  DNA analysis is so far being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia     In surveys of U S  scholars ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s  Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three  often as number one      A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one  while legal scholars placed him second after Washington    In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948  Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls  Schlesinger 1948  Schlesinger 1962  1982 Murray Blessing Survey  Chicago Tribune 1982 poll  Schlesinger 1996  CSPAN 1996  Ridings McIver 1996  Time 2008  and CSPAN 2009  Generally  the top three presidents are rated as 1  Lincoln  2  George Washington  and 3  Franklin D  Roosevelt  although Lincoln and Washington  and Washington and Roosevelt  occasionally are reversed     President Lincoln s assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr  Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty  Republicans linked Lincoln s name to their party  Many  though not all  in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability     Schwartz argues that Lincoln s reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era  19001920s  when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history  with even white Southerners in agreement  The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington    In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president  but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state  In the Cold War years  Lincoln s image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes     By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives   for his intense nationalism  support for business  his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage  his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition  and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers        As a Whig activist  Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests  favoring high tariffs  banks  internal improvements  and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats     William C  Harris found that Lincoln s  reverence for the Founding Fathers  the Constitution  the laws under it  and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism     James G  Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation  in his preference for orderly progress  his distrust of dangerous agitation  and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform   Randall concludes that   he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called  radicalism  which involved abuse of the South  hatred for the slaveholder  thirst for vengeance  partisan plotting  and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders      By the late 1960s  liberals  such as historian Lerone Bennett   were having second thoughts  especially regarding Lincoln s views on racial issues      Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968    He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs  told jokes that ridiculed blacks  insisted he opposed social equality  and proposed sending freed slaves to another country  Defenders  such as authors Dirck and Cashin  retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day    and that he was a  moral visionary  who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause  as fast as politically possible    The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery  or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation      Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln s image suffered  erosion  fading prestige  benign ridicule  in the late 20th century    On the other hand  Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability   defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were  content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts  and not compelled toward fact or reason      Today s U S  President  however  seems to be promoting a sympathetic resurgence for his predecessor  Lincoln  Indeed  President Obama  has insisted on using Lincoln s Bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations      bettersourceneeded    Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood  almost always in a flattering light       Lincoln s portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency   the penny and the  5 bill   His likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town  city  and county names    including the capital of Nebraska     The most famous and most visited memorials are the Lincoln Memorial in Washington  D C   Lincoln s sculpture on Mount Rushmore     Ford s Theatre and Petersen House  where he died  in Washington and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum   located in Springfield  Illinois  not far from Lincoln s home and his tomb        There was also the Great Moments with Mr  Lincoln exhibit in Disneyland   and the Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World   which had to do with Walt Disney admiring Lincoln ever since he was a little boy   Barry Schwartz  a sociologist who has examined America s cultural memory  argues that in the 1930s and 1940s  the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with  a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life   During the Great Depression  he argues  Lincoln served  as a means for seeing the world s disappointments  for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful   Franklin D  Roosevelt  preparing America for war  used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan  Americans asked   What would Lincoln do     However  Schwartz also finds that since World War II  Lincoln s symbolic power has lost relevance  and this  fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness   He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept    ", "McKinley": "Early life and family Civil War Western Virginia and Antietam Shenandoah Valley and promotion Legal career and marriage Rising

 January 29  1843  September 14  1901  was the 25th President of the United States   serving from March 4  1897  until his assassination in September 1901  six months into his second term  McKinley led the nation to victory in the SpanishAmerican War   raised protective tariffs to promote American industry  and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals    McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War   beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major  After the war  he settled in Canton  Ohio   where he practiced law and married Ida Saxton   In 1876  he was elected to Congress   where he became the Republican Party s expert on the protective tariff   which he promised would bring prosperity  His 1890 McKinley Tariff was highly controversial  which together with a Democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office  led to his defeat in the Democratic landslide of 1890  He was elected Ohio s governor in 1891 and 1893  steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests  With the aid of his close adviser Mark Hanna   he secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896  amid a deep economic depression  He defeated his Democratic rival  William Jennings Bryan   after a front porch campaign in which he advocated  sound money   the gold standard unless altered by international agreement  and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity   Rapid economic growth marked McKinley s presidency  He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition  and in 1900  he secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act   McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict  but when negotiation failed  he led the nation in the SpanishAmerican War of 1898  the U S  victory was quick and decisive  As part of the peace settlement   Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico   Guam   and the Philippines   Cuba was promised independence  but at that time remained under the control of the U S  Army  The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 and it became a U S  territory    Historians regard McKinley s 1896 victory as a realigning election   in which the political stalemate of the post Civil War era gave way to the Republican dominated Fourth Party System   which began with the Progressive Era   McKinley defeated Bryan again in the 1900 presidential election   in a campaign focused on imperialism   protectionism   and free silver  However  his legacy was quickly cut short when he was assassinated on September 6  1901  by Leon Czolgosz   a second generation Polish  American with anarchist leanings  McKinley was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt   As an innovator of American interventionism and pro business sentiment  McKinley s presidency is generally considered above average   though his universally positive public perception was soon overshadowed by Roosevelt     William McKinley Jr   was born in 1843 in Niles  Ohio   the seventh child of William and Nancy  ne Allison  McKinley    The McKinleys were of English and Scots Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century  There  the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township      The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy  settling in New Lisbon  now Lisbon   He met Nancy Allison there  and married her later    The Allison family was of mostly English blood and among Pennsylvanias earliest settlers    The family trade on both sides was iron making  and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio  in New Lisbon  Niles  Poland   and finally Canton     The McKinley household was  like many from Ohio s Western Reserve   steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment  the latter based on the family s staunch Methodist beliefs    William followed in the Methodist tradition  becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen     He was a lifelong pious Methodist    In 1852  the family moved from Niles to Poland  Ohio so that their children could attend the better school there  Graduating in 1859  he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville  Pennsylvania   He remained at Allegheny for only one year  returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed  He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance   Ohio where he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon   He did not graduate from either university    Although his health recovered  family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny  first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland  Ohio     When the Southern states seceded from the Union and the American Civil War began  thousands of men in Ohio volunteered for service    Among them were McKinley and his cousin William McKinley Osbourne  who enlisted as privates in the newly formed Poland Guards in July 1861    The men left for Columbus where they were consolidated with other small units to form the 23rd Ohio Infantry     The men were unhappy to learn that  unlike Ohios earlier volunteer regiments   they would not be permitted to elect their officers  they would be designated by Ohios governor  William Dennison     Dennison appointed Colonel William Rosecrans as the commander of the regiment  and the men began training on the outskirts of Columbus    McKinley quickly took to the soldiers life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling the army and the Union cause     Delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons again brought the men into conflict with their officers  but Major Rutherford B  Hayes convinced them to accept what the government had issued them  his style in dealing with the men impressed McKinley  beginning an association and friendship that would last until Hayes death in 1893     After a month of training  McKinley and the 23rd Ohio  now led by Colonel Eliakim P  Scammon   set out for western Virginia  today part of West Virginia  in June 1861 as a part of the Kanawha Division     McKinley initially thought Scammon was a martinet   but when the regiment finally saw battle  he came to appreciate the value of their relentless drilling    Their first contact with the enemy came in September when they drove back Confederate troops at Carnifex Ferry in present day West Virginia    Three days after the battle  McKinley was assigned to duty in the brigade quartermaster office  where he worked both to supply his regiment  and as a clerk    In November  the regiment established winter quarters near Fayetteville  today in West Virginia     McKinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill  and in April 1862 he was promoted to that rank    The regiment resumed its advance that spring with Hayes in command  Scammon by then led the brigade  and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces     That September  McKinleys regiment was called east to reinforce General John Pope s Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run     Delayed in passing through Washington  D C   the 23rd Ohio did not arrive in time for the battle  but joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E  Lee s Army of Northern Virginia as it advanced into Maryland    The 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14    After severe losses  Union forces drove back the Confederates and continued to Sharpsburg   Maryland  where they engaged Lees army at the Battle of Antietam   one of the bloodiest battles of the war    The 23rd was also in the thick of the fighting at Antietam  and McKinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to the men on the line      a   McKinleys regiment again suffered many casualties  but the Army of the Potomac was victorious and the Confederates retreated into Virginia    The regiment was then detached from the Army of the Potomac and returned by train to western Virginia     While the regiment went into winter quarters near Charleston  Virginia  present day West Virginia   McKinley was ordered back to Ohio with some other sergeants to recruit fresh troops    When they arrived in Columbus  Governor David Tod surprised McKinley with a commission as second lieutenant in recognition of his service at Antietam    McKinley and his comrades saw little action until July 1863  when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan s cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island     Early in 1864  the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized  and the division was assigned to George Crook s Army of West Virginia     They soon resumed the offensive  marching into southwestern Virginia to destroy salt and lead mines used by the enemy    On May 9  the army engaged Confederate troops at Cloyds Mountain   where the men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field    McKinley later said the combat there was as desperate as any witnessed during the war    Following the rout  the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and skirmished with the enemy again successfully     McKinley and his regiment moved to the Shenandoah Valley as the armies broke from winter quarters to resume hostilities   Crooks corps was attached to Major General David Hunter s Army of the Shenandoah and soon back in contact with Confederate forces  capturing Lexington  Virginia   on June 11    They continued south toward Lynchburg   tearing up railroad track as they advanced    Hunter believed the troops at Lynchburg were too powerful  however  and the brigade returned to West Virginia    Before the army could make another attempt  Confederate General Jubal Early s raid into Maryland forced their recall to the north    Earlys army surprised them at Kernstown on July 24  where McKinley came under heavy fire and the army was defeated    Retreating into Maryland  the army was reorganized again  Major General Philip Sheridan replaced Hunter  and McKinley  who had been promoted to captain after the battle  was transferred to General Crooks staff    By August  Early was retreating south in the valley  with Sheridans army in pursuit    They fended off a Confederate assault at Berryville   where McKinley had a horse shot out from under him  and advanced to Opequon Creek   where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south    They followed up the victory with another at Fishers Hill on September 22  and were engaged once more at Cedar Creek on October 19    After initially falling back from the Confederate advance  McKinley helped to rally the troops and turn the tide of the battle     After Cedar Creek  the army stayed in the vicinity through election day  when McKinley cast his first presidential ballot  for the incumbent Republican  Abraham Lincoln     The next day  they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near Kernstown    In February 1865  Crook was captured by Confederate raiders    Crook s capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized for the spring campaign  and McKinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen days  Crook  John D  Stevenson   Samuel S  Carroll   and Winfield S  Hancock     Finally assigned to Carrolls staff again  McKinley acted as the generals first and only adjutant     Lee and his army surrendered to General Ulysses S  Grant a few days later  effectively ending the war  McKinley found time to join a Freemason lodge  later renamed after him  in Winchester  Virginia   before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancocks First Veterans Corps in Washington    Just before the wars end  McKinley received his final promotion  a brevet commission as major    In July  the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service  and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties    Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley to apply for a place in the peacetime army  but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month     After the war ended in 1865  McKinley decided on a career in the law and began studying in the office of an attorney in Poland  Ohio     The following year  he continued his studies by attending Albany Law School in New York    After studying there for less than a year  McKinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in Warren  Ohio   in March 1867    That same year  he moved to Canton  the county seat of Stark County   and set up a small office    He soon formed a partnership with George W  Belden   an experienced lawyer and former judge    His practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on Main Street in Canton  which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come    When his Army friend Rutherford B  Hayes was nominated for governor in 1867  McKinley made speeches on his behalf in Stark County  his first foray into politics    The county was closely divided between Democrats and Republicans   but Hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory    In 1869  McKinley ran for the office of prosecuting attorney of Stark County  an office usually then held by Democrats  and was unexpectedly elected    When McKinley ran for re election in 1871  the Democrats nominated William A  Lynch   a prominent local lawyer  and McKinley was defeated by 143 votes     As McKinleys professional career progressed  so too did his social life blossom as he wooed Ida Saxton   the daughter of a prominent Canton family    They were married on January 25  1871  in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton  although Ida soon joined her husband s Methodist church    Their first child  Katherine   was born on Christmas Day 1871    A second daughter  Ida  followed in 1873  but died the same year    McKinleys wife descended into a deep depression at her babys death and her health  never robust  grew worse    Two years later  in 1875  Katherine died of typhoid fever   Ida never recovered from her daughters deaths  the McKinleys had no more children    Ida McKinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband s leaving her side    He remained a devoted husband and tended to his wifes medical and emotional needs for the rest of his life     Ida insisted that McKinley continue his increasingly successful career in law and politics    He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875  and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall    The next year  McKinley undertook a high profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers     Lynch  McKinley s opponent in the 1871 election  and his partner  William R  Day   were the opposing counsel  and the mine owners included Mark Hanna   a Cleveland businessman    Taking the case pro bono   he was successful in getting all but one of the miners acquitted    The case raised McKinleys standing among laborers  a crucial part of the Stark County electorate  and also introduced him to Hanna  who would become his strongest backer in years to come     McKinleys good standing with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio s 17th congressional district     Delegates to the county conventions thought he could attract blue collar voters  and in August 1876  McKinley was nominated    By that time  Hayes had been nominated for president  and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign    Both were successful  McKinley  campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff   defeated the Democratic nominee  Levi L  Lamborn   by 3 300 votes  while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency    McKinleys victory came at a personal cost  his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer      Under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave  Protection is but the law of nature  the law of self preservation  of self development  of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man   It is said  that protection is immoral     Why  if protection builds up and elevates 63 000 000  the U S  population  of people  the influence of those 63 000 000 of people elevates the rest of the world  We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefiting mankind everywhere  Well  they say   Buy where you can buy the cheapest      Of course  that applies to labor as to everything else  Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that  and it is the protection maxim   Buy where you can pay the easiest   And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards      McKinley first took his congressional seat in October 1877  when President Hayes summoned Congress into special session    b   With the Republicans in the minority  McKinley was given unimportant committee assignments  which he undertook conscientiously    McKinleys friendship with Hayes did McKinley little good on Capitol Hill   the President was not well regarded by many leaders there    The young congressman broke with Hayes on the question of the currency  but it did not affect their friendship    The United States had effectively been placed on the gold standard by the Coinage Act of 1873   when silver prices dropped significantly  many sought to make silver again a legal tender  equally with gold  Such a course would be inflationary  but advocates argued that the economic benefits of the increased money supply would be worth the inflation  opponents warned that  free silver  would not bring the promised benefits and would harm the United States in international trade    McKinley voted for the Bland Allison Act of 1878  which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money  and also joined the large majorities in each house that overrode Hayes veto of the legislation  In so doing  McKinley voted against the position of the House Republican leader  his fellow Ohioan and friend  James Garfield      From his first term in Congress  McKinley was a strong advocate of protective tariffs  The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue  but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors  McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection   and that this may have helped form his political views  McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs  and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue    Garfields election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways and Means Committee   McKinley was selected to fill it  placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms     McKinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics  In 1880  he served a brief term as Ohios representative on the Republican National Committee   In 1884  he was elected a delegate to that years Republican convention   where he served as chair of the Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside  By 1886  McKinley  Senator John Sherman   and Governor Joseph B  Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio    Sherman  who had helped to found the Republican Party  ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s  each time failing    while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade  Hanna  once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor  supported Shermans ambitions  as well as those of Foraker  The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention   where McKinley  Foraker  and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman  Convinced Sherman could not win  Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee  Maine Senator James G  Blaine   When Blaine stated he was not a candidate  Foraker returned to Sherman  but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison   who was elected president  In the bitterness that followed the convention  Hanna abandoned Foraker  and for the rest of McKinleys life  the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions  one aligned with McKinley  Sherman  and Hanna and the other with Foraker    Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him  Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans  in the years after 1888  he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinleys political career     In 1889  with the Republicans in the majority  McKinley sought election as Speaker of the House   He failed to gain the post  which went to Thomas B  Reed of Maine   however  Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee  The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress  although McKinleys work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate  it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods     Recognizing McKinleys potential  the Democrats  whenever they controlled the Ohio legislature  sought to gerrymander or redistrict him out of office    In 1878  McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district  he won anyway  causing Hayes to exult  Oh  the good luck of McKinley  He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander  We enjoyed it as much as he did    After the 1882 election  McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party line House vote    Out of office  he was briefly depressed by the setback  but soon vowed to run again  The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election  McKinley was returned to Congress anyway     For 1890  the Democrats gerrymandered McKinley one final time  placing Stark County in the same district as one of the strongest pro Democrat counties  Holmes   populated by solidly Democratic Pennsylvania Dutch   The new boundaries seemed good  based on past results  for a Democratic majority of 2000 to 3000  The Republicans could not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891  but they could throw all their energies into the district  as the McKinley Tariff was a main theme of the Democratic campaign nationwide  and there was considerable attention paid to McKinleys race  The Republican Party sent its leading orators to Canton  including Blaine  then Secretary of State    Speaker Reed and President Harrison  The Democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues    McKinley tirelessly stumped his new district  reaching out to its 40 000 voters to explain that his tariff  was framed for the people    as a defense to their industries  as a protection to the labor of their hands  as a safeguard to the happy homes of American workingmen  and as a security to their education  their wages  and their investments    It will bring to this country a prosperity unparalleled in our own history and unrivalled in the history of the world     Democrats ran a strong candidate in former lieutenant governor John G  Warwick   To drive their point home  they hired young partisans to pretend to be peddlers  who went door to door offering 25 cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents  explaining the rise in prices was due to the McKinley Tariff  In the end  McKinley lost by 300 votes  but the Republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory     Even before McKinley completed his term in Congress  he met with a delegation of Ohioans urging him to run for governor  Governor James E  Campbell   a Democrat  who had defeated Foraker in 1889  was to seek re election in 1891  The Ohio Republican party remained divided  but McKinley quietly arranged for Foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state Republican convention  which chose McKinley by acclamation  The former congressman spent much of the second half of 1891 campaigning against Campbell  beginning in his birthplace of Niles  Hanna  however  was little seen in the campaign  he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for Sherman in the 1892 senatorial election        c   McKinley won the 1891 election by some 20 000 votes    the following January  Sherman  with considerable assistance from Hanna  turned back a challenge by Foraker to win the legislatures vote for another term in the Senate     Ohios governor had relatively little powerfor example  he could recommend legislation  but not veto itbut with Ohio a key swing state   its governor was a major figure in national politics    Although McKinley believed that the health of the nation depended on that of business  he was evenhanded in dealing with labor    He procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers who fired workers for belonging to a union     President Harrison had proven unpopular  there were divisions even within the Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re election drive  Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison  many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged  Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley  Reed  and the aging Blaine  Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate  Harrisons managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis   requiring him to play a public  neutral role  Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall  though no active effort was made to convert delegates to McKinleys cause  McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him  nevertheless he finished third  behind the renominated Harrison  and behind Blaine  who had sent word he did not want to be considered    Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket  Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in the November election   In the wake of Clevelands victory  McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896     Soon after Clevelands return to office  hard times struck the nation with the Panic of 1893   A businessman in Youngstown   Robert Walker  had lent money to McKinley in their younger days  in gratitude  McKinley had often guaranteed Walkers borrowings for his business  The governor had never kept track of what he was signing  he believed Walker a sound businessman  In fact  Walker had deceived McKinley  telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones  Walker was ruined by the recession  McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893    The total owed was over  100 000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney    Instead  McKinleys wealthy supporters  including Hanna and Chicago publisher H  H  Kohlsaat   became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid  Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property in the hands of the funds trustees  who included Hanna and Kohlsaat   and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money  All of the couples property was returned to them by the end of 1893  and when McKinley  who had promised eventual repayment  asked for the list of contributors  it was refused him  Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley  whose popularity grew    He was easily re elected in November 1893  receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War     McKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections  many party candidates in districts where he spoke were successful  His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded with the election in November 1895 of a Republican successor as governor  Asa Bushnell   and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate  McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell  who was of Forakers faction  for governor  in return  the new senator elect agreed to back McKinleys presidential ambitions  With party peace in Ohio assured  McKinley turned to the national arena     It is unclear when William McKinley began to seriously prepare a run for president  As Phillips notes  no documents  no diaries  no confidential letters to Mark Hanna  or anyone else  contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems    From the beginning  McKinleys preparations had the participation of Hanna  whose biographer William T  Horner noted  what is certainly true is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House    Sherman did not run for president again after 1888  and so Hanna could support McKinleys ambitions for that office wholeheartedly     Backed by Hannas money and organizational skills  McKinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896  When other contenders such as Speaker Reed and Iowa Senator William B  Allison sent agents outside their states to organize Republicans in support of their candidacies  they found that Hannas agents had preceded them  According to historian Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 election   Another feature common to the Reed and Allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against the tide which was running toward McKinley  In fact  both campaigns from the moment they were launched were in retreat  The calm confidence with which each candidate claimed the support of his own section  of the country  soon gave way to    bitter accusations that Hanna by winning support for McKinley in their sections had violated the rules of the game     Hanna  on McKinley s behalf  met with the eastern Republican political bosses   such as Senators Thomas Platt of New York and Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania  who were willing to guarantee McKinleys nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices  McKinley  however  was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals  and Hanna accepted that decision    Many of their early efforts were focused on the South  Hanna obtained a vacation home in southern Georgia where McKinley visited and met with Republican politicians from the region  McKinley needed 453 delegate votes to gain the nomination  he gained nearly half that number from the South and border states   Platt lamented in his memoirs   Hanna  had the South practically solid before some of us awakened     The bosses still hoped to deny McKinley a first ballot majority at the convention by boosting support for local favorite son candidates such as Quay  New York Governor  and former vice president  Levi P  Morton   and Illinois Senator Shelby Cullom   Delegate rich Illinois proved a crucial battleground  as McKinley supporters  such as Chicago businessman  and future vice president  Charles G  Dawes   sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for McKinley at the national convention in St  Louis  Cullom proved unable to stand against McKinley despite the support of local Republican machines  at the state convention at the end of April  McKinley completed a near sweep of Illinois delegates    Former president Harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race  when Harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination  the McKinley organization took control of Indiana with a speed Harrison privately found unseemly  Morton operatives who journeyed to Indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for McKinley    Wyoming Senator Francis Warren wrote  The politicians are making a hard fight against him  but if the masses could speak  McKinley is the choice of at least 75  of the entire  body of  Republican voters in the Union     By the time the national convention began in St  Louis on June 16  1896  McKinley had an ample majority of delegates  The former governor  who remained in Canton  followed events at the convention closely by telephone  and was able to hear part of Forakers speech nominating him over the line  When Ohio was reached in the roll call of states  its votes gave McKinley the nomination  which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house  anticipating the first of many crowds that gathered at the Republican candidates home  Thousands of partisans came from Canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear McKinley speak from his front porch  The convention nominated Republican National Committee vice chairman Garret Hobart of New Jersey for vice president  a choice actually made  by most accounts  by Hanna  Hobart  a wealthy lawyer  businessman  and former state legislator  was not widely known  but as Hanna biographer Herbert Croly pointed out  if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it       Before the Republican convention  McKinley had been a straddle bug on the currency question  favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing bimetallism by international agreement  In the final days before the convention  McKinley decided  after hearing from politicians and businessmen  that the platform should endorse the gold standard  though it should allow for bimetallism by international agreement  Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates  led by Colorado Senator Henry M  Teller   to walk out of the convention  However  compared with the Democrats  Republican divisions on the issue were small  especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates         The bad economic times had continued  and strengthened the hand of forces for free silver   The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party  President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard  but an increasing number of rural Democrats wanted silver  especially in the South and West  The silverites took control of the 1896 Democratic National Convention and chose William Jennings Bryan for president  he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech   Bryans financial radicalism shocked bankersthey thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy  Hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election  and they gave  3 5 million for speakers and over 200million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions       Bryans campaign had at most an estimated  500 000  With his eloquence and youthful energy his major assets in the race  Bryan decided on a whistle stop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale  Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryans tour with one of his own  the candidate declined on the grounds that the Democrat was a better stump speaker  I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan  I have to think when I speak    Instead of going to the people  McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him  according to historian R  Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election  it was  as it turned out  a brilliant strategy  McKinleys  Front Porch Campaign  became a legend in American political history     McKinley made himself available to the public every day except Sunday  receiving delegations from the front porch of his home  The railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion ratesthe pro silver Cleveland Plain Dealer disgustedly stated that going to Canton had been made cheaper than staying at home      Delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to McKinleys home on North Market Street  Once there  they crowded close to the front porchfrom which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirsas their spokesman addressed McKinley  The candidate then responded  speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation  The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks  even the spokesmans remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative  This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him         Most Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan  the major exception being the New York Journal   controlled by William Randolph Hearst   whose fortune was based on silver mines  In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of Homer Davenport   Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat  trampling on labor  McKinley was drawn as a child  easily controlled by big business    Even today  these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley  one as a heartless businessman  the other as a creature of Hanna and others of his ilk     The Democrats had pamphlets too  though not as many  Jones analyzed how voters responded to the education campaigns of the two parties   For the people it was a campaign of study and analysis  of exhortation and convictiona campaign of search for economic and political truth  Pamphlets tumbled from the presses  to be read  reread  studied  debated  to become guides to economic thought and political action  They were printed and distributed by the million    but the people hankered for more  Favorite pamphlets became dog eared  grimy  fell apart as their owners laboriously restudied their arguments and quoted from them in public and private debate     The battleground proved to be the Midwest  the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan  and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states      The Northeast was considered most likely safe for McKinley after the early voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September    By then  it was clear that public support for silver had receded  and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue  By the end of September  the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue  and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question    On November 3  1896  the voters had their say in most of the nation  McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest  he won 51  of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College   Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue  and had not appealed to urban workers  Voters in cities supported McKinley  the only city outside the South of more than 100 000 population carried by Bryan was Denver   Colorado     The 1896 presidential election is often seen as a realigning election   in which McKinleys view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed  The voting patterns established then displaced the near deadlock the major parties had seen since the Civil War  the Republican dominance begun then would continue until 1932   another realigning election with the ascent of Franklin Roosevelt     Phillips argues that  with the possible exception of Iowa Senator Allison  McKinley was the only Republican who could have defeated Bryanhe theorized that eastern candidates such as Morton or Reed would have done badly against the Illinois born Bryan in the crucial Midwest    According to the biographer  though Bryan was popular among rural voters  McKinley appealed to a very different industrialized  urbanized America     McKinley was sworn in as president on March 4  1897  as his wife and mother looked on  The new President gave a lengthy inaugural address  he urged tariff reform  and stated that the currency issue would have to await tariff legislation  He warned against foreign interventions  We want no wars of conquest  We must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression     McKinleys most controversial Cabinet appointment was that of John Sherman as Secretary of State     Sherman was not McKinleys first choice for the position  he initially offered it to Senator Allison    One consideration in Senator Shermans appointment was to provide a place in the Senate for Hanna  who had turned down a Cabinet position as Postmaster General    As Sherman had served as Secretary of the Treasury under Hayes  only the State position  the leading Cabinet post  was likely to entice him from the Senate  Shermans mental faculties were decaying even in 1896  this was widely spoken of in political circles  but McKinley did not believe the rumors    Nevertheless  McKinley sent his cousin  William McKinley Osborne  to have dinner with the 73 year old senator  he reported back that Sherman seemed as lucid as ever    McKinley wrote once the appointment was announced  the stories regarding Senator Shermans mental decay are without foundation    When I saw him last I was convinced both of his perfect health  physically and mentally  and that the prospects of life were remarkably good     After some difficulties  Ohio Governor Bushnell appointed Hanna to the Senate    Once in Cabinet office  Shermans mental incapacity became increasingly apparent  He was often bypassed by his first assistant  McKinleys Canton crony Judge William Day  and by the second secretary  Alvey A  Adee   Day  an Ohio lawyer unfamiliar with diplomacy  was often reticent in meetings  Adee was somewhat deaf  One diplomat characterized the arrangement  the head of the department knew nothing  the first assistant said nothing  and the second assistant heard nothing     Maine Congressman Nelson Dingley Jr  was McKinleys choice for Secretary of the Treasury  he declined it  preferring to remain as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee  Charles Dawes  who had been Hanna s lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign  was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young  Dawes eventually became Comptroller of the Currency   he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate  Lyman J  Gage   president of the First National Bank of Chicago and a Gold Democrat     The Navy Department was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long   an old friend from the House  on January 30  1897    Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant  there was considerable pressure on the President elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt   head of the New York City Police Commission and a former state assemblyman  McKinley was reluctant  stating to one Roosevelt booster  I want peace and I am told that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody  Nevertheless  he made the appointment     In addition to Sherman  McKinley made one other ill advised Cabinet appointment    that of Secretary of War   which fell to Russell A  Alger   former general and Michigan governor  Competent enough in peacetime  Alger proved inadequate once the conflict with Spain began  With the War Department plagued by scandal  Alger resigned at McKinley s request in mid 1899    Vice President Hobart  as was customary at the time  was not invited to Cabinet meetings  However  he proved a valuable adviser both for McKinley and for his Cabinet members  The wealthy Vice President leased a residence close to the White House  the two families visited each other without formality  and the Vice President s wife  Jennie Tuttle Hobart   sometimes substituted as Executive Mansion hostess when Ida McKinley was unwell    For most of McKinleys administration  George B  Cortelyou served as his personal secretary   Cortelyou  who served in three Cabinet positions under Theodore Roosevelt  became a combination press secretary and chief of staff to McKinley     For decades  rebels in Cuba had waged an intermittent campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule  By 1895  the conflict had expanded to a war for Cuban independence     As war engulfed the island  Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher  These included the removal of Cubans to internment camps near Spanish military bases  a strategy designed to make it hard for the rebels to receive support in the countryside    American opinion favored the rebels  and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies    As many of his countrymen called for war to liberate Cuba  McKinley favored a peaceful approach  hoping that through negotiation  Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence  or at least to allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy    The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897  but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence  while the rebels  and their American supporters  would never settle for anything less     In January 1898  Spain promised some concessions to the rebels  but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana   McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property    On February 15  the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed    Public opinion and the newspapers demanded war   but McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental    Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence  but on March 20  the court ruled that the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine     As pressure for war mounted in Congress  McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence    Spain refused McKinleys proposals  and on April 11  McKinley turned the matter over to Congress  He did not ask for war  but Congress declared war anyway on April 20  with the addition of the Teller Amendment   which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba     The expansion of the telegraph and the development of the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day to day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed  and he used the new technologies to direct the armys and navys movements as far as he was able    McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War  and did not get along with the Armys commanding general  Nelson A  Miles     Bypassing them  he looked for strategic advice first from Miless predecessor  General John Schofield   and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin     The war led to a change in McKinley s cabinet  as the President accepted Shermans resignation as Secretary of State  Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the wars end     Within a fortnight  the navy had its first victory when the Asiatic Squadron   led by Commodore George Dewey   engaged the Spanish navy at the Battle of Manila Bay in the Philippines  destroying the enemy force without the loss of a single American vessel    Deweys overwhelming victory expanded the scope of the war from one centered in the Caribbean to one that would determine the fate of all of Spain s Pacific colonies    The next month  he increased the number of troops sent to the Philippines and granted the forces commander  Major General Wesley Merritt   the power to set up legal systems and raise taxesnecessities for a long occupation    By the time the troops arrived in the Philippines at the end of June 1898  McKinley had decided that Spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the United States    He professed to be open to all views on the subject  however  he believed that as the war progressed  the public would come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war     Meanwhile  in the Caribbean theater  a large force of regulars and volunteers gathered near Tampa  Florida   for an invasion of Cuba    The army faced difficulties in supplying the rapidly expanding force even before they departed for Cuba  but by June  Corbin had made progress in resolving the problems    After lengthy delays  the army  led by Major General William Rufus Shafter   sailed from Florida on June 20  landing near Santiago de Cuba two days later    Following a skirmish at Las Guasimas on June 24  Shafters army engaged the Spanish forces on July 2 in the Battle of San Juan Hill     In an intense day long battle  the American force was victorious  although both sides suffered heavy casualties    The next day  the Spanish Caribbean squadron  which had been sheltering in Santiagos harbor  broke for the open sea but was intercepted and destroyed by Rear Admiral William T  Sampson s North Atlantic Squadron in the largest naval battle of the war     Shafter laid siege to the city of Santiago  which surrendered on July 17  placing Cuba under effective American control    McKinley and Miles also ordered an invasion of Puerto Rico   which met little resistance when it landed in July    The distance from Spain and the destruction of the Spanish navy made resupply impossible  and the Spanish government began to look for a way to end the war     On July 22  the Spanish authorized Jules Cambon   the French Ambassador to the United States  to represent Spain in negotiating peace    The Spanish initially wished to restrict the discussion to Cuba  but were quickly forced to recognize that their other possessions would be claimed as spoils of war    McKinley s cabinet agreed with him that Spain must leave Cuba and Puerto Rico  but they disagreed on the Philippines  with some wishing to annex the entire archipelago and some wishing only to retain a naval base in the area    Although public sentiment seemed to favor annexation of the Philippines  several prominent political leaders  including Bryan  ex President Cleveland  and the newly formed American Anti Imperialist League made their opposition known     McKinley proposed to open negotiations with Spain on the basis of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation  with the final status of the Philippines subject to further discussion    He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever     Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12  and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898    The talks continued until December 18  when the Treaty of Paris was signed    The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam   and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba  in exchange  the United States agreed to pay Spain  20 million    McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two thirds vote  but his lobbying  and that of Vice President Hobart  eventually saw success  as the Senate voted in favor on February 6  1899  57 to 27     During the war  McKinley also pursued the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii   The new republic  dominated by American interests  had seized power from the royal government in 1893    The lame duck Harrison administration had submitted a treaty of annexation to the Senate  Cleveland  once he returned to office  had sent a special commission to the islands  After receiving the report  Cleveland withdrew the treaty  stating that the revolution did not reflect the will of Hawaiian citizens    Nevertheless  many Americans favored annexation  and the cause gained momentum as the United States became embroiled in war with Spain    McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation  and lobbied Congress to adopt his opinion  believing that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter revolution or a Japanese takeover    Foreseeing difficulty in getting two thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation  McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G  Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress    The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins  and McKinley signed it into law on July 8  1898    McKinley biographer H  Wayne Morgan notes  McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii  showing    a firmness in pursuing it    the President told Cortelyou  We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California  It is manifest destiny     Wake Island   an uninhabited atoll between Hawaii and Guam  was claimed for the United States on July 12  1898     In acquiring Pacific possessions for the United States  McKinley expanded the nations ability to compete for trade in China     Even before peace negotiations began with Spain  McKinley asked Congress to set up a commission to examine trade opportunities in the region and espoused an  Open Door Policy   in which all nations would freely trade with China and none would seek to violate that nations territorial integrity    When John Hay replaced Day as Secretary of State at the end of the war  he circulated notes to that effect to the European powers    Great Britain favored the idea  but Russia opposed it  France  Germany  Italy and Japan agreed in principle  but only if all the other nations signed on     Trade with China became imperiled shortly thereafter as the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners and their property in China    Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and  in cooperation with other western powers  McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition     The westerners were rescued the next month  but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature    McKinleys actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military    After the rebellion ended  the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy  which became the basis of American policy toward China     Closer to home  McKinley and Hay engaged in negotiations with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America  The ClaytonBulwer Treaty   which the two nations signed in 1850  prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there  The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn     Now  with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia  a canal seemed more essential than ever  and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty    Hay and the British ambassador  Julian Pauncefote   agreed that the United States could control a future canal  provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified    McKinley was satisfied with the terms  but the Senate rejected them  demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal    Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation  but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senates demands    He was successful  and a new treaty was drafted and approved  but not before McKinleys assassination in 1901     Two of the great issues of the day  tariff reform and free silver  became intertwined in 1897    Ways and Means chairman Dingley introduced a new tariff bill  later called the Dingley Act   to revise the WilsonGorman Tariff Act of 1894    McKinley supported the bill  which increased tariffs on wool   sugar   and luxury goods   but the proposed new rates alarmed the French  who exported many luxury items to the United States    The Dingley Act passed the House easily  but was delayed in the Senate as they assessed the French objections    French representatives offered to cooperate with the United States in developing an international agreement on bimetallism if the new tariff rates were reduced  this pleased silverite Republicans in the Senate  whose votes were necessary for passage    The Senate amended the bill to allow limited reciprocity  giving France some possibility of relief   but did not reduce the rates on luxury goods    McKinley signed the bill into law and agreed to begin negotiations on an international bimetallism standard     American negotiators soon concluded a reciprocity treaty with France  and the two nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism    The Prime Minister  Lord Salisbury   and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy  Edward O  Wolcott   that he would be amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy s Executive Council there agreed    News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans  and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal    With the international effort a failure  McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard    Even without the agreement  agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage    In the absence of international agreement  McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard  but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate    By 1900  with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions  McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law  and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14  1900  using a gold pen to do so     In the wake of McKinleys election in 1896  African Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality  McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor  and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896  McKinleys priority  however  was in ending sectionalism   and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments  Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low level government posts  and received some praise for that  the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations  Blanche K  Bruce   an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi   received the post of register at the Treasury Department  this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents  McKinley appointed several black postmasters  however  when whites protested the appointment of Justin W  Lyons as postmaster of Augusta  Georgia   McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw  he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruces death in 1898     The President did appoint George B  Jackson   a former slave  to the post of customs collector in Presidio  Texas     However  African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley s victory were overlooked  few were appointed to office     The administrations response to racial violence was minimal  causing him to lose black support    When black postmasters at Hogansville  Georgia in 1897  and at Lake City  South Carolina the following year  were assaulted  McKinley issued no statement of condemnation  Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction  supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene  Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events  as Harrison had done     According to historian Clarance A  Bacote  Before the SpanishAmerican War  the Negroes  in spite of some mistakes  regarded McKinley as the best friend they ever had    African Americans saw the onset of war in 1898 as an opportunity to display their patriotism  and black soldiers fought bravely at El Caney and San Juan Hill  African Americans in the peacetime Army had formed elite units  nevertheless they were harassed by whites as they traveled from the West to Tampa for embarkation to the war  Under pressure from black leaders  McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant  The heroism of the black troops did not still racial tensions in the South  as the second half of 1898 saw several outbreaks of racial violence  11African Americans were killed in riots in Wilmington  North Carolina     McKinley toured the South in late 1898  hoping for sectional reconciliation  In addition to visiting Tuskegee Institute and black educator Booker T  Washington   he addressed the Georgia legislature  wearing a badge of gray  and visited Confederate memorials  In his tour of the South  McKinley did not mention the racial tensions or violence  Although the President received a rapturous reception from Southern whites  many African Americans  excluded from official welcoming committees  felt alienated by the Presidents words and actions       According to Gould and later biographer Phillips  given the political climate in the South  with white legislatures passing segregationist laws such as that upheld in Plessy v  Ferguson   there was little McKinley could have done to improve race relations  and he did better than later presidents Theodore Roosevelt   who doubted racial equality  and Woodrow Wilson   who supported segregation  However  Gould concluded  McKinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all Americans     After the retirement of Justice Stephen Johnson Field   McKinley appointed Attorney General Joseph McKenna to the Supreme Court of the United States in December 1897    The appointment aroused some controversy as McKennas critics in the Senate said he was too closely associated with railroad interests and lacked the qualifications of a Supreme Court justice    Despite the objections  McKennas nomination was approved unanimously    McKenna responded to the criticism of his legal education by taking some courses at Columbia Law School for several months before taking his seat    Along with his Supreme Court appointment  McKinley appointed six judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 28 judges to the United States district courts      Republicans were generally successful in state and local elections around the country in 1899  and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re election in 1900    McKinleys popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second    The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination  McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899    McKinley initially favored Elihu Root   who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War  but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him    He considered other prominent candidates  including Allison and Cornelius N  Bliss   but none were as popular as the Republican partys rising star  Theodore Roosevelt     After a stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy   Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment   they fought bravely in Cuba  and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory  Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898  Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency    Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket  and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904    McKinley remained uncommitted in public  but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor    The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive  his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas Platt   who  disliking Roosevelts reform agenda  sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president     When the Republican convention began in Philadelphia that June  no vice presidential candidate had overwhelming support  but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country    McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention  not to him    On June 21  McKinley was unanimously renominated and  with Hannas reluctant acquiescence  Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot    The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan  setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest     The candidates were the same  but the issues of the campaign had shifted  free silver was still a question that animated many voters  but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party    Democrats knew the war had been popular  even if the imperialism issue was less sure  so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power  painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business    As in 1896  Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home  this time making only one speech  to accept his nomination    Roosevelt emerged as the campaigns primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania    Bryans campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896  and McKinley never doubted that he would be re elected    On November 6  1900  he was proven correct  winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872    Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South   and McKinley even won Bryans home state of Nebraska     Soon after his second inauguration on March 4  1901  William and Ida McKinley undertook a six week tour of the nation  Traveling mostly by rail  the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest  and then up the Pacific coast and east again  to conclude with a visit on June 13  1901  to the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo  New York     However  the First Lady fell ill in California  causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches he had planned to give urging trade reciprocity  He also postponed the visit to the fair until September  planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit     Although McKinley enjoyed meeting the public  Cortelyou was concerned with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe  such as the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year  and twice tried to remove a public reception from the Presidents rescheduled visit to the Exposition  McKinley refused  and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip    On September 5  the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds  before a crowd of some 50 000 people  In his final speech  McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets  He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term       One man in the crowd  Leon Czolgosz   hoped to assassinate McKinley  He had managed to get close to the presidential podium  but did not fire  uncertain of hitting his target    Czolgosz  since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland  had decided to do something heroic  in his own mind  for the cause  After his failure to get close enough on the fifth  Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds  where the President was to meet the public  Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief  and  when he reached the head of the line  shot McKinley twice in the abdomen     McKinley urged his aides to break the news gently to Ida  and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosza request that may have saved his assassins life    McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station  where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet  Although a primitive X ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds  it was not used  McKinley was taken to the Milburn House     In the days after the shooting McKinley appeared to improve  Doctors issued increasingly optimistic bulletins  Members of the Cabinet  who had rushed to Buffalo on hearing the news  dispersed  Vice President Roosevelt departed on a camping trip to the Adirondacks     Leech wrote   It is difficult to interpret the optimism with which the Presidents physicians looked for his recovery  There was obviously the most serious danger that his wounds would become septic  In that case  he would almost certainly die  since drugs to control infection did not exist     Prominent New York City physician  Dr  McBurney was by far the worst offender in showering sanguine assurances on the correspondents  As the only big city surgeon on the case  he was eagerly questioned and quoted  and his rosy prognostications largely contributed to the delusion of the American public     Unknown to the doctors  the gangrene that would kill him was growing on the walls of his stomach  slowly poisoning his blood  On the morning of September 13  McKinley took a turn for the worse  Relatives and friends gathered around the death bed  At 2 15a m  on September 14  President McKinley died  Theodore Roosevelt had rushed back and took the oath of office as president in Buffalo  Czolgosz  put on trial for murder nine days after McKinleys death  was found guilty  sentenced to death on September 26  and executed by electric chair on October 29  1901     According to Gould  The nation experienced a wave of genuine grief at the news of McKinleys passing    The stock market  faced with sudden uncertainty  suffered a steep declinealmost unnoticed in the mourning  The nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train  first to Washington  where it first lay in the East Room of the Executive Mansion  and then in state in the Capitol  and then was taken to Canton    A hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the Capitol Rotunda   many having waited hours in the rain  in Canton  an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18  The following day  a funeral service was held at the First Methodist Church  the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house  where relatives paid their final respects    It was then transported to the receiving vault at West Lawn Cemetery in Canton  to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley already being planned     There was a widespread expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband  one family friend stated  as William McKinley lay dying  that they should be prepared for a double funeral    This did not occur  the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train  Leech noted the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train  praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love    She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton  although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street  She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life  setting up a shrine in her house  and often visiting the receiving vault  until her death at age 59 on May 26  1907    She died only months before the completion of the large marble monument to her husband in Canton  which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30  1907  William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters  atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton     In addition to the Canton site there are many memorials to McKinley  There is a monument at his birthplace in Niles  20Ohio schools bear his name    There are several schools in the United States named McKinley School   Nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of McKinley memorials in the year after his death    Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley s death that he would be ranked among the great presidents    Statues to him may be found in more than a dozen states  his name has been bestowed on streets  civic organizations  and libraries  McKinley s name is also used in the large inner city Honolulu  Hawaii high school  President William McKinley High School      Denali   in central Alaska   was named Mount McKinley in support of the then newly minted Republican nominee for President until The Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to Denali in 1975  which is how it was called by locals  The mountain s name was changed to Denali on the federal level by the Department of the Interior as a part of a visit to Alaska by President Barack Obama in August 2015    its summit  at 20 310 feet  6 190m   is the highest point in North America  Similarly  until its name was changed to Denali National Park on December 2  1980  under congressional legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter   the park in which it is located was known as Mount McKinley National Park     McKinleys biographer  H  Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history    However  the young  enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessors death  The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations  Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded  by 1920  according to Gould  McKinleys administration was deemed no more than a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelts    Beginning in the 1950s  McKinley received more favorable evaluations  nevertheless  in surveys ranking American presidents  he has generally been placed near the middle  often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland    Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinleys presidency profoundly affected the nations future  he more followed public opinion than led it  and that McKinleys standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency     There has been broad agreement among historians that McKinleys election was at the time of a transition between two political eras  dubbed the Third and Fourth Party Systems     Kenneth F  Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro business  industrial  and modernizing program  represented by McKinley    Historian Daniel P  Klinghard argued that McKinleys personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidencyrather than simply follow the party platformby representing himself as the voice of the people    However  more recently  as Republican political official Karl Rove exalted McKinley as the agent of sweeping political realignment in the 2000s  some scholars  such as David Mayhew  questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment  thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it    Historian Michael J  Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern  powerful president  this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries     Phillips writes that McKinleys low rating is undeserved  and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln  He pointed to McKinleys success at building an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation    Phillips believes that part of McKinleys legacy is the men he included in his administration  who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death  These officials included Cortelyou  who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt  and Dawes  who became vice president under Coolidge   Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day  who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years  and William Howard Taft   whom McKinley had made Governor General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president     A controversial aspect of McKinleys presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialismwith the exception of the Philippines  granted independence in 1946  the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley    The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire     Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power  he expects the debate over McKinleys actions to continue indefinitely without resolution  and notes that however one judges McKinleys actions in American expansion  one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better     Morgan alludes to the rise of interest in McKinley as part of the debate over the more assertive American foreign policy of recent decades   McKinley was a major actor in some of the most important events in American history  His decisions shaped future policies and public attitudes  He usually rises in the estimation of scholars who study his life in detail  Even those who disagree with his policies and decisions see him as an active  responsible  informed participant in charge of decision making  His dignified demeanor and subtle operations keep him somewhat remote from public perception  But he is once again at the center of events  where he started     Books  Articles  Online ",

Benjamin Harrison  August 20  1833 March 13  1901  was the 23rd President of the United States  18891893   he was the grandson of the ninth President  William Henry Harrison   Before ascending to the presidency  Harrison established himself as a prominent local attorney  Presbyterian church leader and politician in Indianapolis   Indiana  During the American Civil War   he served the Union as a colonel and on February 14  1865 was confirmed by the U S  Senate as a brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from January 23  1865  After the war  he unsuccessfully ran for the governorship of Indiana   He was later elected to the U S  Senate by the Indiana legislature   A Republican   Harrison was elected to the presidency in 1888   defeating the Democratic incumbent Grover Cleveland   Hallmarks of his administration included unprecedented economic legislation  including the McKinley Tariff   which imposed historic protective trade rates  and the Sherman Antitrust Act   Harrison facilitated the creation of the National Forests through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891  He also substantially strengthened and modernized the Navy  and conducted an active foreign policy  He proposed  in vain  federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for African Americans during his administration   Due in large part to surplus revenues from the tariffs  federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term  The spending issue in part led to the defeat of the Republicans in the 1890 mid term elections   Harrison was defeated by Cleveland in his bid for re election in 1892  due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending  He then returned to private life in Indianapolis but later represented the Republic of Venezuela in an international case against the United Kingdom   In 1900  he traveled to Europe as part of the case and  after a brief stay  returned to Indianapolis  He died the following year of complications from influenza   Although many have praised Harrison s commitment to African Americans  voting rights  scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below average  and rank him in the bottom half among U S  presidents     Harrison s paternal ancestors were the Virginia Harrisons   Their immigrant ancestor was Benjamin Harrison  who arrived in Jamestown  Virginia   in 1630  The future president Benjamin was born on August 20  1833  in North Bend   Ohio   as the second of eight children to John Scott Harrison and Elizabeth Ramsey  Irwin   Benjamin was a grandson of President William Henry Harrison and the great grandson of Benjamin Harrison V   a Virginia governor and signer of the Declaration of Independence       a   Harrison was seven years old when his grandfather was elected President  but he did not attend the inauguration    Although Harrison s family was distinguished  his parents were not wealthy  John Scott Harrison spent much of his farm income on his children s education    Despite the family s meager resources  Harrison s boyhood was enjoyable  much of it spent outdoors fishing or hunting     Benjamin Harrison s early schooling took place in a one room schoolhouse near his home  but his parents later arranged for a tutor to help him with college preparatory studies    Harrison and his brother Irwin enrolled in Farmer s College near Cincinnati  Ohio in 1847    He attended the college for two years     b   and while there met his future wife  Caroline Lavinia Scott   one of the daughters of the science professor  John Witherspoon Scott    In 1850  Harrison transferred to Miami University in Oxford  Ohio and graduated in 1852    He joined the fraternity Phi Delta Theta   which he used as a network for much of his life  He was also a member of Delta Chi   a law fraternity which permitted dual membership    Classmates included John Alexander Anderson     who became a six term congressman  and Whitelaw Reid who ran as Harrison s vice presidential candidate in his presidential reelection campaign  At Miami  Harrison was strongly influenced by history and political economy professor Robert Hamilton Bishop     Harrison joined a Presbyterian church at college and  like his mother  became a lifelong member     After completing college  Harrison took up the study of law as a legal apprentice in the Cincinnati law office of Storer   Gwynne   Before completing his law studies  Harrison returned to Oxford to marry Caroline Scott    On October 20  1853  Caroline s father  also a Presbyterian minister  performed the ceremony     The Harrisons had two children  Russell Benjamin Harrison  August 12  1854 December 13  1936   and Mary  Mamie  Scott Harrison  April 3  1858 October 28  1930      Harrison returned to live on his father s farm while finishing his law studies  That same year  he inherited  800 after the death of an aunt  and used the funds to move with Caroline to Indianapolis  Indiana in 1854    He was admitted to the bar and began practicing law in the office of John H  Ray  The same year he became a crier for the Federal Court in Indianapolis  for which he was paid  2 50 per day    Harrison became a founding member and first president of both the University Club  a private gentlemen s club and the Phi Delta Theta Alumni Club    Harrison and his wife joined and assumed leadership positions at the First Presbyterian Church     Having grown up in a Whig household  he favored that party s politics while young  He joined the Republican Party shortly after its formation in 1856  and that year campaigned on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate John C  Frmont     Harrison was elected as the Indianapolis City Attorney that year  a position that paid an annual salary of  400     In 1858  Harrison entered into a law partnership with William Wallace and they opened their office called Wallace   Harrison    In Two years hence  Harrison successfully ran as the Republican candidate for reporter of the Indiana Supreme Court   He was an active supporter of his party s platform  and served as Republican State Committee Secretary  His law partner Wallace was elected as county clerk in 1860  Harrison established a new firm with William Fishback  named Fishback   Harrison  They worked together until he entered the Army after the start of the American Civil War      In 1862  President Abraham Lincoln issued a call for more recruits for the Union Army  Harrison wanted to enlist  but worried about how to support his young family    While visiting Governor Oliver Morton   Harrison found him distressed over the shortage of men answering the latest call  Harrison told the governor   If I can be of any service  I will go      Morton asked Harrison if he could help recruit a regiment  although he would not ask him to serve  Harrison recruited throughout northern Indiana to raise a regiment  Morton offered him the command  but Harrison declined  as he had no military experience  He was initially commissioned as a captain and company commander on July 22  1862  Governor Morton commissioned Harrison as a colonel on August 7  1862  and the newly formed 70th Indiana was mustered into Federal service on August 12  1862  Once mustered  the regiment left Indiana to join the Union Army at Louisville  Kentucky       For much of its first two years  the 70th Indiana performed reconnaissance duty and guarded railroads in Kentucky and Tennessee   In 1864  Harrison and his regiment joined William T  Sherman  s Atlanta Campaign and moved to the front lines  On January 2  1864  Harrison was promoted to command the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of the XX Corps   He commanded the brigade at the battles of Resaca   Cassville   New Hope Church   Lost Mountain  Kennesaw Mountain   Marietta   Peachtree Creek and Atlanta   When Sherman s main force began its March to the Sea   Harrison s brigade was transferred to the District of Etowah and participated in the Battle of Nashville      On January 23  1865  President Lincoln nominated Harrison to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers  to rank from that date  and the Senate confirmed the nomination on February 14  1865    He rode in the Grand Review in Washington  D C  before mustering out on June 8  1865     While serving in the army in October 1864  Harrison was reelected reporter of the Supreme Court of Indiana and served four more years    Although not politically powerful  the position provided Harrison a steady income    President Grant appointed him to represent the federal government in a civil claim brought by Lambdin P  Milligan   whose wartime conviction for treason had been reversed by the Supreme Court  Due to Harrison s advocacy  the damages awarded against the government were minimal     With his increasing reputation  local Republicans urged Harrison to run for Congress  He initially confined his political activities to speaking on behalf of other Republican candidates  a task for which he received high praises from his colleagues     In 1872  Harrison campaigned for the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana   Former governor Oliver Morton favored his opponent  Thomas M  Browne   and Harrison lost his bid for statewide office    He returned to his law practice and  despite the Panic of 1873   he was financially successful enough to build a grand new home in Indianapolis in 1874    He continued to make speeches on behalf of Republican candidates and policies     In 1876  the original Republican nominee for governor dropped out of the race and Harrison accepted the Republicans  invitation to take his place on the ticket    He centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency  He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D  Williams   losing by 5 084 votes out of a total 434 457 cast    Following his defeat  Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in the state  When the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis  he helped to mediate between the workers and management and to preserve public order     When United States Senator Morton died in 1878  the Republicans nominated Harrison to run for the seat  but the party failed to gain a majority in the state legislature  which at that time elected senators  the Democratic majority elected Daniel W  Voorhees instead      c   In 1879 President Hayes appointed Harrison to the Mississippi River Commission   which worked to develop internal improvements on the river    As a delegate to the 1880 Republican National Convention the following year    he was instrumental in breaking a deadlock on candidates  and James A  Garfield won the nomination   After Harrison led the Republican delegation at the National Convention  he was considered a presumptive Senate candidate    He gave speeches in favor of Garfield in Indiana and New York  further raising his profile in the party  When the Republicans retook the state legislature   Harrison s election to the Senate was threatened by his intra party rival Judge Walter Q  Gresham   but Harrison was ultimately chosen    After Garfield s election as president in 1880  his administration offered Harrison a cabinet position which he declined in favor of continued service as senator     Harrison served in the Senate from March 4  1881  to March 4  1887 and chaired the U S  Senate Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard   47th Congress   and the U S  Senate Committee on Territories   48th and 49th Congresses       In 1881  the major issue confronting Senator Harrison was the budget surplus  Democrats wished to reduce the tariff and limit the amount of money the government took in  Republicans instead wished to spend the money on internal improvements and pensions for Civil War veterans  Harrison took his party s side and advocated for generous pensions for veterans and their widows    He also supported  unsuccessfully  aid for education of Southerners  especially the children of the freedmen  he believed that education was necessary to help the black population rise to political and economic equality with whites    Harrison opposed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882   which his party supported  as he thought it violated existing treaties with China      In 1884  Harrison and Gresham competed for influence at the 1884 Republican National Convention      the delegation ended up supporting James G  Blaine   the eventual nominee    In the Senate  Harrison achieved passage of his Dependent Pension Bill  only to see it vetoed by President Grover Cleveland     His efforts to further the admission of new western states were stymied by Democrats  who feared that the new states would elect Republicans to Congress     In 1885  the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature  which resulted in an increased Democratic majority in 1886  despite an overall Republican majority statewide    Harrison was thereby defeated in his bid for reelection  this resulted after a deadlock in the state senate   with the legislature eventually choosing Democrat David Turpie     Harrison then returned to Indianapolis and his law practice  but stayed active in state and national politics     The initial favorite for the Republican nomination was the previous nominee  James G  Blaine of Maine   After Blaine wrote several letters denying any interest in the nomination  his supporters divided among other candidates  with John Sherman of Ohio as the leader among them    Others  including Chauncey Depew of New York   Russell Alger of Michigan   and Harrison s old nemesis Walter Q  Gresham  now a federal appellate court judge in Chicago   also sought the delegates  support at the 1888 Republican National Convention     Blaine did not publicly endorse any of the candidates as a successor  however  on March 1  1888 he privately wrote that  the one man remaining who in my judgment can make the best one is Benjamin Harrison      Harrison placed fourth on the first ballot  with Sherman in the lead  and the next few ballots showed little change    The Blaine supporters shifted their support among candidates they found acceptable  and when they shifted to Harrison  they found a candidate who could attract the votes of many other delegations    He was nominated as the party s presidential candidate on the eighth ballot  by a count of 544 to 108 votes    Levi P  Morton of New York was chosen as his running mate     Harrison s opponent in the general election was incumbent President Grover Cleveland  He reprised a more traditional front porch campaign   abandoned by his immediate predecessors  he received visiting delegations to Indianapolis and made ninety plus pronouncements from his home town    The Republicans campaigned heavily in favor of protective tariffs   turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North  The election focused on the swing states of New York  New Jersey  Connecticut  and Harrison s home state of Indiana    Harrison and Cleveland split these four states  with Harrison winning in New York and Indiana    Voter turnout was 79 3   reflecting a large interest in the campaign  nearly eleven million votes were cast    Although Harrison received 90 000 fewer popular votes than Cleveland  he carried the Electoral College 233 to 168    Allegations were made against Republicans for engaging in irregular ballot practices  an example was described as Blocks of Five      Although he had made no political bargains  his supporters had given many pledges upon his behalf  When Boss Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania  who rebuffed for a Cabinet position for his political support during the convention  heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to Providence   Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know  how close a number of men were compelled to approach   the penitentiary to make him President     Harrison was known as the Centennial President because his inauguration celebrated the centenary of the first inauguration of George Washington in 1789    In congressional elections  the Republicans increased their membership in the House of Representatives by nineteen seats     Harrison was sworn into office on Monday  March 4  1889 by Chief Justice Melville Fuller     At 5  6  tall  he was only slightly taller than Madison  the shortest president  but much heavier  he was the fourth  and last  president to sport a full beard   Harrison s Inauguration ceremony took place during a rainstorm in Washington D C   Outgoing U S  President Grover Cleveland attended the ceremony and held an umbrella over Harrison s head as he took the oath of office   His speech was brief  half as long as that of his grandfather  William Henry Harrison  whose speech holds the record for the longest inaugural address of a U S  president    In his speech  Benjamin Harrison credited the nation s growth to the influences of education and religion  urged the cotton states and mining territories to attain the industrial proportions of the eastern states and promised a protective tariff  Concerning commerce  he said   If our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal obligations and duties  they would have less call to complain of the limitations of their rights or of interference with their operations     Harrison also urged early statehood for the territories and advocated pensions for veterans  a statement that was met with enthusiastic applause  In foreign affairs  Harrison reaffirmed the Monroe Doctrine as a mainstay of foreign policy  while urging modernization of the Navy and a merchant marine force  He gave his commitment to international peace through noninterference in the affairs of foreign governments     John Philip Sousa  s Marine Corps band played at the Inaugural Ball inside the Pension Building with a large crowd attending    After moving into the White House  Harrison noted  quite prophetically   There is only a door  one that is never locked  between the president s office and what are not very accurately called his private apartments  There should be an executive office building  not too far away  but wholly distinct from the dwelling house  For everyone else in the public service there is an unroofed space between the bedroom and the desk      Harrison acted quite independently in selecting his cabinet  much to the dismay of the Republican bosses  He began by delaying the presumed nomination of James G  Blaine as Secretary of State so as to preclude Blaine s involvement in the formation of the administration  as had occurred in President Garfield s term    In fact  other than Blaine  the only Republican boss initially nominated was Redfield Proctor  as Secretary of War  Senator Shelby Cullom s comment symbolizes Harrison s steadfast aversion to use federal positions for patronage   I suppose Harrison treated me as well as he did any other Senator  but whenever he did anything for me  it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please     Harrison s selections shared particular alliances  such as their service in the Civil War  Indiana citizenship and membership in the Presbyterian Church    Nevertheless  Harrison with these choices had alienated pivotal Republican operatives from New York to Pennsylvania to Iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future    Harrison s normal schedule provided for two full cabinet meetings per week  as well as separate weekly one on one meetings with each cabinet member     Civil service reform was a prominent issue following Harrison s election  Harrison had campaigned as a supporter of the merit system   as opposed to the spoils system     Although some of the civil service had been classified under the Pendleton Act by previous administrations  Harrison spent much of his first months in office deciding on political appointments    Congress was widely divided on the issue and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue in hope of preventing the alienation of either side  The issue became a political football of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned  What can I do when both parties insist on kicking     Harrison appointed Theodore Roosevelt and Hugh Smith Thompson   both reformers  to the Civil Service Commission   but otherwise did little to further the reform cause     Harrison quickly saw the enactment of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890  a cause he had championed while in Congress    In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans  regardless of the cause of their disability   the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus    Pension expenditures reached  135million under Harrison  the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history  a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R  Tanner  s expansive interpretation of the pension laws    Harrison  who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake  due to his apparent loose management style and tongue  asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B  Raum     Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases    Harrison  having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum  kept him in office for the rest of his administration     One of the first appointments Harrison was forced to reverse was that of James S  Clarkson as an assistant postmaster  Clarkson  who had expected a full cabinet position  began sabotaging the appointment from the outset  gaining the reputation for  decapitating a fourth class postmaster every three minutes   Clarkson himself stated  I am simply on detail from the Republican Committee   I am most anxious to get through this task and leave   He resigned in September 1890     The tariff levels had been a major political issue since before the Civil War  and they became the most dominant matter of the 1888 election    The high tariff rates had created a surplus of money in the Treasury  which led many Democrats  as well as the growing Populist movement  to call for lowering them    Most Republicans preferred to maintain the rates  spend the surplus on internal improvements and eliminate some internal taxes     Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W  Aldrich framed the McKinley Tariff that would raise the tariff even higher  including making some rates intentionally prohibitive    At Secretary of State James Blaine s urging  Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions  which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports    The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar   and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production    Even with the reductions and reciprocity  the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history  and the spending associated with it contributed to the reputation of the Billion Dollar Congress      Members of both parties were concerned with the growth of the power of trusts and monopolies   and one of the first acts of the 51st Congress was to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act   sponsored by Senator John Sherman of Ohio    The Act passed by wide margins in both houses  and Harrison signed it into law    The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind  and marked a new use of federal government power    While Harrison approved of the law and its intent  his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it    However  the government successfully concluded a case during Harrison s time in office  against a Tennessee coal company     d   and had initiated several other cases against trusts     One of the most volatile questions of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver   or by gold alone     The issue cut across party lines  with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver  and both parties  representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard    Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold  taxpayers paid their government bills in silver  while international creditors demanded payment in gold  resulting in a depletion of the nation s gold supply    Owing to worldwide deflation in the late 19th century  however  a strict gold standard had resulted in reduction of incomes without the equivalent reduction in debts  pushing debtors and the poor to call for silver coinage as an inflationary measure     The silver coinage issue had not been much discussed in the 1888 campaign and Harrison is said to have favored a bimetallist position    However  his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary  William Windom   encouraged the free silver supporters    Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions  advocating a free coinage of silver  but at its own value  not at a fixed ratio to gold    This failed to facilitate a compromise between the factions  In July 1890  Senator Sherman achieved passage of a bill  the Sherman Silver Purchase Act   in both houses    Harrison thought that the bill would end the controversy  and he signed it into law    The effect of the bill  however  was the increased depletion of the nation s gold supply  a problem that would persist until the second Cleveland administration resolved it      After regaining the majority in both Houses of Congress  some Republicans  led by Harrison  attempted to pass legislation to protect black Americans  civil rights    Harrison s Attorney General  William H  H  Miller   through the Justice Department  ordered the prosecutions for violation of voting rights in the South  however  white juries often failed to convict or indict violators    This prompted Harrison to urge Congress to pass legislation that would  secure all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other civil right under the Constitution and laws     Harrison endorsed the proposed Federal Elections Bill written by Representative Henry Cabot Lodge and Senator George Frisbie Hoar in 1890  but the bill was defeated in the Senate    Following the failure to pass the bill  Harrison continued to speak in favor of African American civil rights in addresses to Congress  Most notably  on December 3  1889  Harrison had gone before Congress and stated   The colored people did not intrude themselves upon us  they were brought here in chains and held in communities where they are now chiefly bound by a cruel slave code   when and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot  When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law  When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored      in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights  The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed  Every constituency in the Union is wronged     He severely questioned the states  civil rights records  arguing that if states have the authority over civil rights  then  we have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it     Harrison also supported a bill proposed by Senator Henry W  Blair   which would have granted federal funding to schools regardless of the students  races    He also endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court ruling in the Civil Rights Cases  1883  that declared much of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 unconstitutional    None of these measures gained congressional approval     In March 1891 Congress enacted and Harrison signed the Land Revision Act of 1891   This legislation resulted from a bipartisan desire to initiate reclamation of surplus lands that had been  up to that point  granted from the public domain  for potential settlement or use by railroad syndicates  As the law s drafting was finalized  Section 24 was added at the behest of Harrison by his Secretary of the Interior John Noble  which read as follows   That the President of the United States may  from time to time  set apart and reserve  in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests  in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth  whether of commercial value or not  as public reservations  and the President shall  by public proclamation  declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof     Within a month of the enactment of this law Harrison authorized the first forest reserve  to be located on public domain adjacent to Yellowstone Park  in Wyoming  Other areas were so designated by Harrison  bringing the first forest reservations total to 22 million acres in his term     During Harrison s administration  the Lakota Sioux   previously confined to reservations in South Dakota  grew restive under the influence of Wovoka   a medicine man  who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance     Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance  and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government  On December 29  1890  troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee   The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux  including many women and children    the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave    In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A  Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota  the uprising was brought to an end    Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century    Harrison s general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and  despite the massacre  he believed the policy to have been generally successful    This policy  known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act   was favored by liberal reformers at the time  but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators     In Harrison s time in office  the United States was continuing to experience advances in science and technology  Harrison was the earliest President whose voice is known to be preserved  That thirty six second recording   help  info   was originally made on a wax phonograph cylinder in 1889 by Gianni Bettini     Harrison also had electricity installed in the White House for the first time by Edison General Electric Company   but he and his wife would not touch the light switches for fear of electrocution and would often go to sleep with the lights on     Over the course of his administration Harrison marshaled the country s technology to clothe the nation with a credible naval power  When he took office there were only two commissioned warships in the Navy  In his inaugural address he said   construction of a sufficient number of warships and their necessary armaments should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection     Harrison s Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F  Tracy spearheaded the rapid construction of vessels  and within a year congressional approval was obtained for building of the warships Indiana   Texas   Oregon and Columbia   By 1898  with the help of the Carnegie Corporation  no less than ten modern warships  including steel hulls and greater displacements and armaments  had transformed the United States into a legitimate naval power  Seven of these had begun during the Harrison term     Harrison and Secretary of State Blaine were often not the most cordial of friends  but harmonized in an aggressive foreign policy and commercial reciprocity with other nations    Blaine s persistent medical problems warranted more of a hands on effort by Harrison in the conduct of foreign policy  In San Francisco   while on tour of the United States in 1891  Harrison proclaimed that the United States was in a  new epoch  of trade and that the expanding navy would protect oceanic shipping and increase American influence and prestige abroad    The First International Conference of American States met in Washington in 1889  Harrison set an aggressive agenda including customs and currency integration and named a bipartisan delegation to the conference  led by John B  Henderson and Andrew Carnegie   The conference failed to achieve any diplomatic breakthrough  due in large part to an atmosphere of suspicion fostered by the Argentinian delegation  It did succeed in establishing an information center that became the Pan American Union     In response to the diplomatic bust  Harrison and Blaine pivoted diplomatically and initiated a crusade for tariff reciprocity with Latin American nations  the Harrison administration concluded eight reciprocity treaties among these countries    On another front  Harrison sent Frederick Douglass as ambassador to Haiti   but failed in his attempts to establish a naval base there     In 1889  the United States  the United Kingdom and Germany were locked in a dispute over control of the Samoan Islands  Historian George H  Ryden s research indicates Harrison played a key role in determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations  this included selection of the local ruler  refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany  as well as the establishment of a three power protectorate  a first for the U S   These arrangements facilitated the future dominant power of the U S  in the Pacific  Secretary of State Blaine was absent due to complication of lumbago     Throughout the 1880s various European countries had imposed a ban on importation of United States pork out of an unconfirmed concern of trichinosis   at issue was over one billion pounds of pork products with a value of  80 million  annually   Harrison engaged Whitelaw Reid  minister to France  and William Walter Phelps   minister to Germany  to restore these exports for the country without delay  Harrison also successfully asked the congress to enact the Meat Inspection Act to eliminate the accusations of product compromise  The president also partnered with Agriculture Secretary Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation  by initiating an embargo in the U S  against Germany s highly demanded beet sugar  By September 1891 Germany relented  and was soon followed by Denmark  France and Austria Hungary     The first international crisis Harrison faced arose from disputed fishing rights on the Alaskan coast  Canada claimed fishing and sealing rights around many of the Aleutian Islands   in violation of U S  law    As a result  the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships    In 1891  the administration began negotiations with the British that would eventually lead to a compromise over fishing rights after international arbitration  with the British government paying compensation in 1898    In 1891  a diplomatic crisis emerged in Chile   otherwise known as the Baltimore Crisis   The American minister to Chile  Patrick Egan   granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the 1891 Chilean Civil War   Egan  previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U S   was motivated by a personal desire to thwart Great Britain s influence in Chile    his action increased tensions between Chile and the United States  which began in the early 1880s when Secretary Blaine had alienated the Chileans in the War of the Pacific    The crisis began in earnest when sailors from the USS Baltimore took shore leave in Valparaiso and a fight ensued  resulting in the deaths of two American sailors and the arrest of three dozen others    The Baltimore s captain  Winfield Schley  based on the nature of the sailors  wounds  insisted the sailors had been bayonet attacked by Chilean police without provocation  With Blaine incapacitated  Harrison drafted a demand for reparations    The Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Manuel Matta replied that Harrison s message was  erroneous or deliberately incorrect   and said that the Chilean government was treating the affair the same as any other criminal matter     Tensions increased to the brink of war  Harrison threatened to break off diplomatic relations unless the United States received a suitable apology  and said the situation required   grave and patriotic consideration   The president also remarked   If the dignity as well as the prestige and influence of the United States are not to be wholly sacrificed  we must protect those who in foreign ports display the flag or wear the colors     The Navy was also placed on a high level of preparedness    A recuperated Blaine made brief conciliatory overtures to the Chilean government which had no support in the administration  he then reversed course  joined the chorus for unconditional concessions and apology by the Chileans  who ultimately obliged  and war was averted  Theodore Roosevelt later applauded Harrison for his use of the  big stick  in the matter       In the last days of his administration  Harrison dealt with the issue of Hawaiian annexation  Following a coup d tat against Queen Liliuokalani   the new government of Hawaii led by Sanford Dole petitioned for annexation by the United States    Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands    The United States consul in Hawaii John L  Stevens recognized the new government on February 1  1893 and forwarded their proposals to Washington  With just one month left before leaving office  the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison s recommendation    The Senate failed to act  and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office     Harrison appointed four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States   The first was David Josiah Brewer   a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit   Brewer  the nephew of Justice Field   had previously been considered for a cabinet position    Shortly after Brewer s nomination  Justice Matthews died  creating another vacancy  Harrison had considered Henry Billings Brown   a Michigan judge and admiralty law expert  for the first vacancy and now nominated him for the second    For the third vacancy  which arose in 1892  Harrison nominated George Shiras   Shiras s appointment was somewhat controversial because his agesixtywas older than usual for a newly appointed Justice    Shiras also drew the opposition of Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania because they were in different factions of the Pennsylvania Republican party  but his nomination was nonetheless approved    Finally  at the end of his term  Harrison nominated Howell Edmunds Jackson to replace Justice Lamar   who died in January 1893  Harrison knew the incoming Senate would be controlled by Democrats  so he selected Jackson  a respected Tennessee Democrat with whom he was friendly to ensure his nominee would not be rejected    Jackson s nomination was indeed successful  but he died after only two years on the Court     In addition to his Supreme Court appointments  Harrison appointed ten judges to the courts of appeals   two judges to the circuit courts   and 26 judges to the district courts   Because Harrison was in office when Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the courts of appeals  he and Grover Cleveland were the only two Presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies   When Harrison took office  no new states had been admitted in more than a decade  owing to Congressional Democrats  reluctance to admit states that they believed would send Republican members  Early in Harrison s term  however  the lame duck Congress passed bills that admitted four states to the union  North Dakota and South Dakota on November 2  1889  Montana on November 8  and Washington on November 11    The following year two more states held constitutional conventions and were admitted  Idaho on July 3 and Wyoming on July 10  1890    The initial Congressional delegations from all six states were solidly Republican    More states were admitted under Harrison s presidency than any other since George Washington  s   Harrison attended the three day grand Centennial Celebration of the country in New York City on April 30  1889  He made the following remarks  We have come into the serious but always inspiring presence of Washington  He was the incarnation of duty and he teaches us today this great lesson  that those who would associate their names with events that shall outlive a century can only do so by high consecration to duty  Self seeking has no public observance or anniversary      The Harrisons made many trips out of the capital  which included speeches at most stops  including Philadelphia  New England  Indianapolis and Chicago  The President typically made his best impression speaking before large audiences  as opposed to more intimate settings    The most notable of his presidential trips  theretofore unequaled  was a five week tour of the west in the spring of 1891  aboard a lavishly outfitted train    Harrison quite enjoyed a number of short trips out of the capital  usually for hunting  to nearby Virginia or Maryland  On one such trip the game of choice was coon  for which Harrison was not well experienced  he shot and killed one Gilbert Wooten s hog  having mistaken it for a coon  while Mr  Wooten was thereby made happily famous  the president was not     During the dreadfully hot summers of Washington  favorite locations to which the Harrisons made refuge were Deer Park  Maryland and Cape May Point in New Jersey  In 1890 John Wanamaker joined with other Philadelphia devotees of the Harrisons and made an entirely unsolicited gift to them of a summer cottage at Cape May  Harrison  though appreciative  was most uncomfortable with the ethical appearance  a month later he wrote Wanamaker a  10 000 personal check for reimbursement to the various donors of the gift  Nevertheless  Harrison s opponents made the gift the subject of national ridicule  in which Mrs  Harrison and the president were both vigorously criticized     The treasury surplus had evaporated and the nation s economic health was worsening  precursors to the eventual Panic of 1893     Congressional elections in 1890 had gone against the Republicans  and although Harrison had cooperated with Congressional Republicans on legislation  several party leaders withdrew their support for him because of his adamant refusal to give party members the nod in the course of his executive appointments  Specifically  Thomas C  Platt  Mathew S  Quay  Thomas B  Reed and James Clarkson quietly organized the Grievance Committee  the ambition of which was to initiate a dump Harrison offensive  They solicited the support of Blaine  without effect however  and Harrison in reaction resolved to run for re election  seemingly forced choose one of two options   become a candidate or forever wear the name of a political coward      It was clear that Harrison would not be re nominated unanimously    Many of Harrison s detractors persisted in pushing for an incapacitated Blaine  though he announced that he was not a candidate in February 1892    Some party leaders still hoped to draft Blaine into running  and speculation increased when he resigned at the 11th hour as Secretary of State in June    At the convention in Minneapolis   Harrison prevailed on the first ballot  but encountered significant opposition     The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland  making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier  The tariff revisions of the past four years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position    Many westerners  traditionally Republican voters  defected to the new Populist Party candidate  James Weaver   who promised free silver  generous veterans  pensions  and an eight hour work day     The effects of the suppression of the Homestead Strike rebounded against the Republicans as well  although the federal government did not take action     Harrison s wife Caroline began a critical struggle with tuberculosis earlier in 1892 and two weeks before the election  on October 25  it took her life    Their daughter Mary Harrison McKee assumed the role of First Lady after her mother s death    Mrs  Harrison s terminal illness and the fact that both candidates had served in the White House called for a low key campaign  and resulted in neither of the candidates actively campaigning personally     Cleveland ultimately won the election by 277 electoral votes to Harrison s 145  and also won the popular vote by 5 556 918 to 5 176 108  this was the most decisive presidential election in 20 years       After he left office  Harrison visited the World s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in June 1893    where the nation s first commemorative postage was introduced  an initiative of his Postmaster General  John Wanamaker  After the Expo  Harrison returned to his home in Indianapolis  Harrison had been elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in 1882  and was elected as commander  president  of the Ohio Commandery on May 3  1893   For a few months in 1894  Harrison lived in San Francisco  California  where he gave law lectures at Stanford University     In 1896 some of Harrison s friends in the Republican party tried to convince him to seek the presidency again  but he declined  He traveled around the nation making appearances and speeches in support of William McKinley s candidacy for president     From July 1895 to March 1901 Harrison served on the Board of Trustees of Purdue University   where Harrison Hall  a dormitory  was named in his honor    He wrote a series of articles about the Federal government and the presidency which were republished in 1897 as a book titled This Country of Ours     In 1899 Harrison attended the First Peace Conference at The Hague    In 1896  Harrison at age 62 remarried  to Mary Scott Lord Dimmick   the widowed 37 year  old niece and former secretary of his deceased wife  Harrison s two adult children  Russell  41 years old at the time  and Mary  Mamie  McKee  38  disapproved of the marriage and did not attend the wedding  Benjamin and Mary had one child together  Elizabeth  February 21  1897 December 26  1955      In 1900  Harrison served as an attorney for the Republic of Venezuela in their British Guiana boundary dispute with the United Kingdom    An international trial was agreed upon  he filed an 800 page brief and traveled to Paris where he spent more than 25 hours in court on their behalf  Although he lost the case  his legal arguments won him international renown     Harrison developed what was thought to be influenza or grippe in February 1901  He was treated with steam vapor inhalation and oxygen  but his condition worsened  He died from pneumonia at his home on Wednesday  March 13  1901  at the age of 67    Harrison is interred in Indianapolis s Crown Hill Cemetery   next to Caroline  After her death  Mary Dimmick Harrison was buried next to him     Following the Panic of 1893   Harrison became more popular in retirement    His legacy among historians is scant  and  general accounts of his period inaccurately treat Harrison as a cipher     More recently   historians have recognized the importance of the Harrison

the United States   serving from 1969 to 1974 when he became the only U S  president to resign the office  Nixon had previously served as a U S  Representative and Senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961   Nixon was born in Yorba Linda  California   After completing his undergraduate work at Whittier College   he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law  He and his wife  Pat Nixon   moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942  He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II   Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950   His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti communist  and elevated him to national prominence  He was the running mate of Dwight D  Eisenhower   the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election   Nixon served for eight years as vice president   He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960   narrowly losing to John F  Kennedy   and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962   In 1968 he ran again for the presidency and was elected    Nixon ended American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American prisoners home  At the same time he ended military draft   Nixon s visit to the

Arab oil embargo and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal   The scandal escalated  costing Nixon much of his political support  and on August 9  1974  he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office  After his resignation  he was issued a pardon by his successor  Gerald Ford   In retirement  Nixon s work authoring several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image  He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18  1994  and died four days later at the age of 81  Nixon remains a source of considerable interest among historians     Nixon was born on January 9  1913 in Yorba Linda  California   in a house his father built      He was the son of Hannah  Milhous  Nixon and Francis A  Nixon   His mother was a Quaker and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith  Nixon s upbringing was marked by evangelical Quaker observances of the time  such as refraining from alcohol  dancing  and swearing  Nixon had four brothers  Harold  190933   Donald  191487   Arthur  191825   and Edward  born 1930     Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary England   Richard  for example  was named after Richard the Lionheart        Nixon s early life was marked by hardship  and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood   We were poor  but the glory of it was we didn t know it     The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922  and the family moved to Whittier   California  In an area with many Quakers  Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station    Richard s younger brother Arthur died in 1925 after a short illness    At the age of twelve  Richard was found to have a spot on his lung and  with a family history of tuberculosis   he was forbidden to play sports  Eventually  the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia       Young Richard attended East Whittier Elementary School  where he was president of his eighth grade class    His parents believed that attendance at Whittier High School had caused Richard s older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before the older boy fell ill of tuberculosis  he died of the disease in 1933   Instead  they sent Richard to the larger Fullerton Union High School       He received excellent grades  even though he had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman yearlater  he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week    He played junior varsity football  and seldom missed a practice  even though he was rarely used in games    He had greater success as a debater  winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton s Head of English  H  Lynn Sheller  Nixon later remembered Sheller s words   Remember  speaking is conversation    don t shout at people  Talk to them  Converse with them     Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible     His parents permitted Richard to transfer to Whittier High School for his junior year  beginning in September 1928  At Whittier High  Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat  for student body president  He generally rose at 4a m   to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market  He then drove to the store to wash and display them  before going to school  Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year  when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health  the demands on Richard increased  causing him to give up football  Nevertheless  Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207students     Nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard University   but Harold s continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store  He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College   his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather    Nixon played for the basketball team  he also tried out for football  but lacked the size to play  He remained on the team as a substitute  and was noted for his enthusiasm    Instead of fraternities and sororities  Whittier had literary societies  Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men  the Franklins  many members of the Franklins were from prominent families but Nixon was not  He responded by helping to found a new society  the Orthogonian Society    In addition to the society  schoolwork  and work at the store  Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities  becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker    In 1933  he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch  daughter of the Whittier police chief  The two broke up in 1935     After his graduation from Whittier in 1934  Nixon received a full scholarship to attend Duke University School of Law     The school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships    It paid high salaries to its professors  many of whom had national or international reputations    The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second  and third year students  forcing recipients into intense competition    Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association    inducted into the Order of the Coif     and graduated third in his class in June 1937     After graduating from Duke  Nixon initially hoped to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation   He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later that he had been hired  but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts    Instead  he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937  He began practicing with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in Whittier    working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters  as well as on wills     In later years  Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney  Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases  disliking frank sexual talk from women    In 1938  he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra  California     and became a full partner in the firm the following year     In January 1938  Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of The Dark Tower   There he played opposite a high school teacher named Thelma  Pat  Ryan     Nixon described it in his memoirs as  a case of love at first sight    for Nixon only  as Pat Ryan turned down the young lawyer several times before agreeing to date him    Once they began their courtship  Ryan was reluctant to marry Nixon  they dated for two years before she assented to his proposal  They wed at a small ceremony on June 21  1940  After a honeymoon in Mexico  the Nixons began their married life in Whittier    They had two daughters  Tricia  born 1946  and Julie  born 1948      In January 1942  the couple moved to Washington  D C   where Nixon took a job at the Office of Price Administration     In his political campaigns  Nixon would suggest that this was his response to Pearl Harbor   but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941  Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier    He was assigned to the tire rationing division  where he was tasked with replying to correspondence  He did not enjoy the role  and four months later  applied to join the United States Navy     As a birthright Quaker  he could have claimed exemption from the draft   but chose not to apply  he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service  His application to enlist was successful  and he was inducted into the Navy in August 1942     Nixon completed Officers Candidate School and was commissioned as an ensign in October 1942  His first post was as aide to the commander of the Naval Air Station Ottumwa in Iowa   Seeking more excitement  he requested sea duty and was reassigned as the naval passenger control officer for the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command   supporting the logistics of operations in the South West Pacific theater       He was Officer in Charge of the Combat Air Transport Command at Guadalcanal in the Solomons and later at Green Island  Nissan island  just north of Bougainville   His unit prepared manifests and flight plans for C 47 operations and supervised the loading and unloading of the cargo aircraft  For this service he received a Letter of Commendation for  meritorious and efficient performance of duty as Officer in Charge of the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command  On October 1  1943  Nixon was promoted to lieutenant   Nixon earned two service stars and that citation of commendation  although he saw no actual combat  Upon his return to the U S   Nixon was appointed the administrative officer of the Alameda Naval Air Station in California  In January 1945  he was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics office in Philadelphia to help negotiate the termination of war contracts  and he received another letter of commendation for his work there    Later  Nixon was transferred to other offices to work on contracts and finally to Baltimore    In October 1945  he was promoted to lieutenant commander     He resigned his commission on New Year s Day 1946     In 1945  Republicans in California s 12th congressional district   frustrated by their inability to defeat Democratic Congressman Jerry Voorhis   sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him  They formed a  Committee of 100  to decide on a candidate  hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to Voorhis victories  After the committee failed to attract higher profile candidates  Herman Perry  Whittier s Bank of America branch manager  suggested Nixon  a family friend with whom he had served on the Whittier College Board of Trustees before the war  Perry wrote to Nixon in Baltimore   After a night of excited talk between the Nixons  the naval officer responded to Perry with enthusiasm  Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee  When he left the Navy at the start of 1946  Nixon and his wife returned to Whittier  where Nixon began a year of intensive campaigning      He contended that Voorhis had been ineffective as a congressman and suggested that Voorhis s endorsement by a group linked to communists meant that Voorhis must have radical views    Nixon won the election  receiving 65 586 votes to Voorhis  49 994     In Congress  Nixon supported the TaftHartley Act of 1947  a federal law that monitors the activities and power of labor unions  and served on the Education and Labor Committee   He was part of the Herter Committee  which went to Europe to report on the need for U S  foreign aid  Nixon was the youngest member of the committee  and the only Westerner    Advocacy by Herter Committee members  including Nixon  led to congressional passage of the Marshall Plan      Nixon first gained national attention in 1948 when his investigation  as a member of the House Un American Activities Committee  HUAC   broke the Alger Hiss spy case  While many doubted Whittaker Chambers   allegations that Hiss  a former State Department official  had been a Soviet spy  Nixon believed them to be true and pressed for the committee to continue its investigation  Under suit for defamation filed by Hiss  Chambers produced documents corroborating his allegations  These included paper and microfilm copies that Chambers turned over to House investigators after having hidden them overnight in a field  they became known as the   Pumpkin Papers      Hiss was convicted of perjury in 1950 for denying under oath he had passed documents to Chambers    In 1948  Nixon successfully cross filed as a candidate in his district  winning both major party primaries    and was comfortably reelected     In 1949  Nixon began to consider running for the United States Senate against the Democratic incumbent  Sheridan Downey     and entered the race in November of that year    Downey  faced with a bitter primary battle with Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas   announced his retirement in March 1950    Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections   and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoing Korean War was a major issue    Nixon tried to focus attention on Douglas  liberal voting record  As part of that effort  a   Pink Sheet   was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that  as Douglas  voting record was similar to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio  believed by some to be a communist   their political views must be nearly identical    Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points    During this campaign  Nixon was first called  Tricky Dick  by his opponents for his campaign tactics     In the Senate  Nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism  traveling frequently and speaking out against the threat    He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti communist  the controversial Wisconsin senator  Joseph McCarthy   but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy s allegations    Nixon also criticized President Harry S  Truman  s handling of the Korean War    He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii  voted in favor of civil rights for minorities  and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia    He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions  benefits for illegal immigrants  and public power     General Dwight D  Eisenhower was nominated for president by the Republicans in 1952  He had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate  and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a   smoke filled room   and recommended Nixon to the general  who agreed to the senator s selection  Nixon s youth  he was then 39   stance against communism  and political base in Californiaone of the largest stateswere all seen as vote winners by the leaders  Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Ohio Senator Robert A  Taft   New Jersey Governor Alfred Driscoll and Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen       On the campaign trail  Eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country  leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate      In mid September  the Republican ticket faced a major crisis    The media reported that Nixon had a political fund  maintained by his backers  which reimbursed him for political expenses    Such a fund was not illegal  but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest  With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon s resignation from the ticket   the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on September 23  1952    The address  later termed the Checkers speech   was heard by about 60 million Americansincluding the largest television audience up to that point    Nixon emotionally defended himself  stating that the fund was not secret  nor had donors received special favors  He painted himself as a man of modest means  his wife had no mink coat  instead she wore a  respectable Republican cloth coat   and a patriot    The speech would be remembered for the gift which Nixon had received  but which he would not give back   a little cocker spaniel dog     sent all the way from Texas  And our little girlTricia  the 6 year oldnamed it Checkers     The speech was a masterpiece and prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon    Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket    which proved victorious in the November election      Eisenhower gave Nixon responsibilities during his term as vice presidentmore than any previous vice president    Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was absent  A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center  He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina     On his return to the United States at the end of 1953  Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations     Biographer Irwin Gellman  who chronicled Nixon s congressional years  said of his vice presidency   Eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office  The vice president welcomed the president s initiatives and worked energetically to accomplish White House objectives  Because of the collaboration between these two leaders  Nixon deserves the title   the first modern vice president      Despite intense campaigning by Nixon  who reprised his strong attacks on the Democrats  the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the 1954 elections   These losses caused Nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term    On September 24  1955  President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack  his condition was initially believed to be life threatening  Eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks  The 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution had not yet been proposed  and the Vice President had no formal power to act  Nonetheless  Nixon acted in Eisenhower s stead during this period  presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power    According to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose   Nixon had  earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis    he made no attempt to seize power      His spirits buoyed  Nixon sought a second term  but some of Eisenhower s aides aimed to displace him  In a December 1955 meeting  Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration  Nixon  however  believed such an action would destroy his political career  When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956  he hedged on the choice of his running mate  stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated  Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower  Nixon received a substantial number of write in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election  In late April  the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate    Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election      In the spring of 1957  Nixon undertook another major foreign trip  this time to Africa  On his return  he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress  The bill was weakened in the Senate  and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it  Nixon advised the President to sign the bill  which he did    Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957  and Nixon gave a press conference  assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower s brief illness     On April 27  1958  Richard and Pat Nixon embarked on a goodwill tour of South America  In Montevideo   Uruguay  Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus  where he fielded questions from students on U S  foreign policy  The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reached Lima   Peru  where he was met with student demonstrations  Nixon went to the campus  got out of his car to confront the students  and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects  At his hotel  Nixon faced another mob  and one demonstrator spat on him    In Caracas   Venezuela  Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti American demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe wielding mob    According to Ambrose  Nixon s courageous conduct  caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect      In July 1959  President Eisenhower sent Nixon to the Soviet Union for the opening of the American National Exhibition in Moscow  On July 24  while touring the exhibits with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev   the two stopped at a model of an American kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the   Kitchen Debate       In 1960  Nixon launched his first campaign for President of the United States  He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries   and chose former Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr  as his running mate    His Democratic opponent was John F  Kennedy   and the race remained close for the duration    Nixon campaigned on his experience  but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the EisenhowerNixon administration had allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the U S  in ballistic missiles  the   missile gap       A new political medium was introduced in the campaign  televised presidential debates   In the first of four such debates  Nixon appeared pale  with a five o clock shadow   in contrast to the photogenic Kennedy    Nixon s performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television  though many people listening on the radio thought that Nixon had won    Nixon lost the election narrowly  with Kennedy ahead by only 120 000 votes  0 2percent  in the popular vote     There were charges of vote fraud in Texas and Illinois  both states won by Kennedy  Nixon refused to consider contesting the election  feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States in the eyes of the world  and the uncertainty would hurt U S  interests    At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961  Nixon and his family returned to California  where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book  Six Crises   which included coverage of the Hiss case  Eisenhower s heart attack  and the Fund Crisis  which had been resolved by the Checkers speech       Local and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election     Despite initial reluctance  Nixon entered the race    The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping stone for another presidential run  some opposition from the far right of the party  and his own lack of interest in being California s governor    Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation s leading active Republican politician  and ensure he remained a major player in national politics    Instead  he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points  and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career    In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election  Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent  saying   You won t have Nixon to kick around anymore because  gentlemen  this is my last press conference     The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11  1962  episode of ABC  s Howard K  Smith  News and Comment entitled  The Political Obituary of Richard M  Nixon     Alger Hiss appeared on the program  and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president  The furor drove Smith and his program from the air    and public sympathy for Nixon grew     The Nixon family traveled to Europe in 1963  where Nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited    The family moved to New York City  where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon  Mudge  Rose  Guthrie   Alexander     Nixon had pledged  when announcing his California campaign  not to run for president in 1964  even if he had not  he believed it would be difficult to defeat Kennedy  or after his assassination   Kennedy s successor  Lyndon Johnson    In 1964  he supported Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president  when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination  Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention   Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win  Nixon campaigned for him loyally  The election was a disaster for the Republicans  Goldwater s landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors     Nixon was one of the few leading Republicans not blamed for the disastrous results  and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections  He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election     At the end of 1967  Nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time  Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life    for example  she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech     she was supportive of her husband s ambitions  Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War   a Republican had a good chance of winning  although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960     One of the most tumultuous primary election seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched  followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary  it concluded with the assassination of one of the Democratic candidates  Senator Robert F  Kennedy   just moments after his victory in the California primary  On the Republican side  Nixon s main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney   though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention   Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot    He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate  a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party  appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats     Nixon s Democratic opponent in the general election was Vice President Hubert Humphrey   who was nominated at a convention marked by violent protests     Throughout the campaign  Nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval    He appealed to what he later called the   silent majority   of socially conservative Americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the anti war demonstrators  Agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups  solidifying Nixon s position with the right     Nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign  meeting with supporters in front of cameras    He stressed that the crime rate was too high  and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the Democrats of the United States  nuclear superiority    Nixon promised   peace with honor   in the Vietnam War and proclaimed that  new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the Pacific     He did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war  resulting in media intimations that he must have a   secret plan      His slogan of  Nixon s the One  proved to be effective     Johnson s negotiators hoped to reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election  Nixon received astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger   then a consultant to U S  negotiator Averell Harriman   and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault in Saigon  She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu not to go to Paris to join the talks  hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected  Johnson was aware of what was going on  as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged  and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U S  foreign policy  On October 31  with no agreement  Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing  and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6  the day after Election Day  On November 2  after speaking with Chennault again  Thieu stated he would not go to Paris  Johnson telephoned Nixon  who denied any involvement  the President did not believe him  Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault s involvement  which had been obtained by wiretapping  but told Humphrey  who chose not to use the information     In a three way race between Nixon  Humphrey  and independent candidate former Alabama Governor George Wallace   Nixon defeated Humphrey by nearly 500 000 votes  seven tenths of a percentage point   with 301 electoral votes to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace      In his victory speech  Nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together     Nixon said   I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President  congratulating me for winning the election  I congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds  I also told him that I know exactly how he felt  I know how it feels to lose a close one      Nixon was inaugurated as president on January 20  1969  sworn in by his onetime political rival  Chief Justice Earl Warren   Pat Nixon held the family Bibles open at Isaiah 2 4  which reads   They shall beat their swords into plowshares  and their spears into pruning hooks   In his inaugural address  which received almost uniformly positive reviews  Nixon remarked that  the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker    a phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone    He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity   In these difficult years  America has suffered from a fever of words  from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver  from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds  from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading  We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another  until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices     Nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China even before he became president  writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election   There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation     Assisting him in this venture was his National Security Advisor and future Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger   with whom the President worked closely  bypassing Cabinet officials  With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir border clashes between the two took place during Nixon s first year in officeNixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations  A breakthrough came in early 1971  when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players  Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials    On July 15  1971  it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon  on television and radio  that the President would visit China the following February  The announcements astounded the world    The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact     In February 1972  Nixon and his wife traveled to China  Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40hours in preparation    Upon touching down  the President and First Lady emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai   Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou s hand  something which then Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva    Over 100television journalists accompanied the president  On Nixon s orders  television was strongly favored over printed publications  as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print  It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised     Nixon and Kissinger met for an hour with Mao and Zhou at Mao s official private residence  where they discussed a range of issues    Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon  whom he considered forthright  unlike the leftists and the Soviets    He said he was suspicious of Kissinger    though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his  encounter with history     A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the Great Hall of the People   The following day  Nixon met with Zhou  the joint communique following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China  and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification    When not in meetings  Nixon toured architectural wonders including the Forbidden City   Ming Tombs   and the Great Wall     Americans received their first glimpse into Chinese life through the cameras which accompanied Pat Nixon  who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes  schools  factories  and hospitals     The visit ushered in a new era of Sino American relations    Fearing the possibility of a Sino American alliance  the Soviet Union yielded to pressure for dtente with the United States     When Nixon took office  about 300 American soldiers were dying each week in Vietnam    and the war was broadly unpopular in the United States  with violent protests against the war ongoing  The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions  but this agreement never fully took force  According to Walter Isaacson  soon after taking office  Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly    Conversely  Black argues that Nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate North Vietnam through the   Madman theory      Nixon sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw  while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack     Nixon approved a secret bombing campaign of North Vietnamese and allied Khmer Rouge positions in Cambodia in March 1969  code named Operation Menu      a policy begun under Johnson    These operations resulted in heavy bombing of Cambodia  by one measurement more bombs were dropped over Cambodia under Johnson and Nixon than the Allies dropped during World War II    In mid 1969  Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese  sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders  and peace talks began in Paris  Initial talks  however  did not result in an agreement    In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation     In July 1969  Nixon visited South Vietnam   where he met with his U S  military commanders and President Nguyen Van Thieu   Amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout  he implemented a strategy of replacing American troops with Vietnamese troops   known as   Vietnamization      He soon instituted phased U S  troop withdrawals   but authorized incursions into Laos   in part to interrupt the Ho Chi Minh trail   used to supply North Vietnamese forces  that passed through Laos and Cambodia  Nixon announced the ground invasion of Cambodia to the American public on April 30  1970    His responses to protesters included an impromptu  early morning meeting with them at the Lincoln Memorial on May 9  1970        Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot  s then second in command  Nuon Chea     Nixon s campaign promise to curb the war  contrasted with the escalated bombing  led to claims that Nixon had a   credibility gap   on the issue     In 1971  excerpts from the   Pentagon Papers    which had been leaked by Daniel Ellsberg   were published by The New York Times and The Washington Post   When news of the leak first appeared  Nixon was inclined to do nothing  the Papers  a history of United States  involvement in Vietnam  mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations  He was persuaded by Kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared  and the President tried to prevent publication  The Supreme Court eventually ruled for the newspapers     As U S  troop withdrawals continued  conscription was reduced and in 1973 ended  the armed forces became all volunteer    After years of fighting  the Paris Peace Accords were signed at the beginning of 1973  The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops  however  it did not require the 160 000 North Vietnam Army regulars located in the South to withdraw    Once American combat support ended  there was a brief truce  before fighting broke out again  this time without American combat involvement  North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975     Nixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis   on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president  Fidel Castro   He maintained close relations with the Cuban American exile community through his friend  Bebe Rebozo   who often suggested ways of irritating Castro  These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans  who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis  In August 1970  the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding  despite his hard line against Castro  Nixon agreed  The process had not yet been completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970  A minor confrontation ensued  which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles  The final round of diplomatic notes  reaffirming the 1962 accord  were exchanged in November     The election of Marxist candidate Salvador Allende as President of Chile in September 1970 spurred Nixon and Kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende     25 first designed to convince the Chilean congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup    Other support included strikes organized against Allende and funding for Allende opponents  It was even alleged that  Nixon personally authorized   700 000 in covert funds to print anti Allende messages in a prominent Chilean newspaper     93 Following an extended period of social  political  and economic unrest  General Augusto Pinochet assumed power in a violent coup d tat on September 11  1973  among the dead was Allende      Nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace  Following the announcement of his visit to China  the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union  The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22  1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev   the General Secretary of the Communist Party   Alexei Kosygin   the Chairman of the Council of Ministers   and Nikolai Podgorny   the head of state   among other leading Soviet officials     Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev    Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties  SALT I   the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers    and the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty   which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles  Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of  peaceful coexistence   A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin      Seeking to foster better relations with the United States  both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily        Nixon later described his strategy   I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist  if possible  the help of the Soviets and the Chinese  Though rapprochement with China and dtente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves  I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war  At worst  Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing  At best  if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry  Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept     Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in U S  Soviet relations  Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974    He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony  cheering crowds  and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening    Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta   where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact  dtente  and MIRVs   While he considered proposing a comprehensive test ban treaty  Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it    There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations      As part of the Nixon Doctrine that the U S  would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible  instead giving them assistance to defend themselves  the U S  greatly increased arms sales to the Middle Eastparticularly Israel  Iran and Saudi Arabiaduring the Nixon administration    The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel  an American ally in the Middle East  but the support was not unconditional  Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it  The president believed thatexcept during the Suez Crisis the U S  had failed to intervene with Israel  and should use the leverage of the large U S  military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table  However  the Arab Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon s attention during his first termfor one thing  he felt that no matter what he did  American Jews would oppose his reelection    a    On October 6  1973  an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria  supported with tons of arms and materiel by the Soviet Union  attacked Israel in what was known as the Yom Kippur War   Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses  cutting through inter departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by Arab nations  More than a week later  by the time the U S  and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce   Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory  The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis  when Israel gained the upper hand  Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U S  USSR peacekeeping mission  which the U S  refused  When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily  Nixon ordered the U S  military to DEFCON 3    placing all U S  military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war  This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis  Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon s actions     Because Israel s victory was largely due to U S  support  the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U S   resulting in the 1973 oil crisis     The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973  and was eventually ended by the oil producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold     After the war  and under Nixon s presidency  the U S  reestablished relations with Egypt for the first time since 1967  Nixon used the Middle East crisis to restart the stalled Middle East Peace Negotiations   he wrote in a confidential memo to Kissinger on October 20   I believe that  beyond a doubt  we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East  I am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by    I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves     Nixon made one of his final international visits as president to the Middle East in June 1974  and became the first President to visit Israel     At the time Nixon took office in 1969  inflation was at 4 7percentits highest rate since the Korean War  The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson  which  together with the Vietnam War costs  was causing large budget deficits  Unemployment was low  but interest rates were at their highest in a century    Nixon s major economic goal was to reduce inflation  the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war    This could not be accomplished overnight  and the U S  economy continued to struggle through 1970  contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections  Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon s presidency     According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon s economic record  the new president did little to alter Johnson s policies through the first year of his presidency     Nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies  but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition  and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection  As part of his   New Federalism   views  he proposed grants to the states  but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process  However  Nixon gained political credit for advocating them    In 1970  Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes  though the Democratic majorities  knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career  did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority    With inflation unresolved by August 1971  and an election year looming  Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at Camp David   He then announced temporary wage and price controls  allowed the dollar to float against other currencies  and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold    Bowles points out   by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation s defeat  Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents    to criticize him  His opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself     Nixon s policies dampened inflation through 1972  although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration     After he won reelection  Nixon found inflation returning    He reimposed price controls in June 1973  The price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople  who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy    The controls produced food shortages   as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss    Despite the failure to control inflation  controls were slowly ended  and on April 30  1974  their statutory authorization lapsed     Nixon advocated a   New Federalism    which would devolve power to state and local elected officials  though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them    He eliminated the Cabinet level United States Post Office Department   which in 1971 became the government run United States Postal Service      Nixon was a late convert to the conservation movement   Environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election  the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject  He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject  and sought to use that to his benefit  in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech   other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA   the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects    Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them  which he deemed excessive  After Congress overrode his veto  Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable     In 1971  Nixon proposed health insurance reforma private health insurance employer mandate    b   federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children    and support for health maintenance organizations  HMOs     A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973    In 1974  Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reforma private health insurance employer mandate   b   and replacement of Medicaid by state run health insurance plans available to all  with income based premiums and cost sharing      Concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among American soldiers in Vietnam  Nixon called for a War on Drugs   pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad  and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities     As one policy initiative  Nixon called for more money for sickle cell research  treatment  and education in February 1971   and signed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act on May 16  1972        c   While Nixon called for increased spending on such high profile items as cancer and sickle cell  at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the National Institutes of Health      The Nixon years witnessed the first large scale integration of public schools in the South    Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats  whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites    Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972  he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then  Soon after his inauguration  he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force  which worked with local leadersboth white and blackto determine how to integrate local schools  Agnew had little interest in the work  and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz   Federal aid was available  and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees  By September 1970  less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools  By 1971  however  tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities  with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance  Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use     In addition to desegregating public schools  Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970the first significant federal affirmative action program    He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification    Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968  though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election  Nevertheless  he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had     After a nearly decade long national effort   the United States won the race to land astronauts on the Moon on July 20  1969  with the flight of Apollo 11   Nixon spoke with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their moonwalk  He called the conversation  the most historic phone call ever made from the White House      Nixon  however  was unwilling to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  at the high level seen through the 1960s as NASA prepared to send men to the Moon  NASA Administrator Thomas O  Paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981  Nixon  however  rejected both proposals due to the expense    Nixon also canceled the Air Force Manned Orbital Laboratory program in 1969  because unmanned spy satellites were shown to be a more cost effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective     On March 7  1970  Nixon announced the end of the Kennedy Johnson era s massive efforts in the space race   stating  We must think of  space activities  as part of a continuing process    and not as a series of separate leaps  each requiring a massive concentration of energy  Space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities    What we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are important to us   He then cancelled the last three planned Apollo lunar missions to place Skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the Space Shuttle      On May 24  1972  Nixon approved a five year cooperative program between NASA and the Soviet space program   culminating in the 1975 joint mission of an American Apollo and Soviet Soyuz spacecraft linking in space     Nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment   The Democratic   Solid South   had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions  Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate Southerners  Nixon s efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace s candidacy  Through his first term  he pursued a Southern Strategy with policies  such as his desegregation plans  that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites  encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the Civil Rights era   He nominated two Southern conservatives  Clement Haynsworth and G  Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court  but neither was confirmed by the Senate     Nixon entered his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5  1972  effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection    Virtually assured the Republican nomination    the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy  brother of the late president   but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident     Instead  Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner  with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place     On June 10  McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination    The following month  Nixon was renominated at the 1972 Republican National Convention   He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive    McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending   and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights   With some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization  McGovern was perceived as standing for  amnesty  abortion and acid   McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate  Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton   dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression       Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle  and was reelected on November 7  1972 in one of the largest landslide election victories in American history   He defeated McGovern with over 60percent of the popular vote  losing only in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia      The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration  Those activities included   dirty tricks    or bugging the offices of political opponents and the harassment of activist groups and political figures  The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington  D C  on June 17  1972  The Washington Post picked up on the story  reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on an informant known as   Deep Throat  later revealed to be Mark Felt   associate director at the FBIto link the men to the Nixon administration  Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics  calling news articles biased and misleading  A series of revelations made it clear that the Committee to Re elect President Nixon  and later the White House  was involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats  Senior aides such as White House Counsel John Dean faced prosecution  in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing        In July 1973  White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified under oath to Congress that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office  These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate Special Counsel Archibald Cox   Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes  citing executive privilege   With the White House and Cox at loggerheads  Nixon had Cox fired in October in the   Saturday Night Massacre    he was replaced by Leon Jaworski   In November  Nixon s lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations  held in the White House on June 20  1972  featured an 18 minute gap    Rose Mary Woods   the President s personal secretary  claimed responsibility for the gap  alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape  though her tale was widely mocked  The gap  while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President  cast doubt on Nixon s statement that he had been unaware of the cover up     Though Nixon lost much popular support  even from his own party  he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office    He insisted that he had made mistakes  but had no prior knowledge of the burglary  did not break any laws  and did not learn of the cover up until early 1973    On October 10  1973  Vice President Agnew resigned unrelated to Watergate and was convicted on charges of bribery  tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland  Nixon chose Gerald Ford   Minority Leader of the House of Representatives   to replace Agnew     On November 17  1973  during a televised question and answer session with the press    Nixon said    People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook  Well  I m not a crook  I ve earned everything I ve got      The legal battle over the tapes continued through early 1974  and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1 200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides  The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9  1974  which were televised on the major TV networks  These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment    On July 24  the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes  not just selected transcripts  must be released     The scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the President  ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes  Nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due  and paid  465 000 in back taxes in 1974     Even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations  Nixon hoped to fight the charges  However  one of the new tapes  recorded soon after the break in  demonstrated that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place  and had approved plans to thwart the investigation  In a statement accompanying the release of what became known as the  Smoking Gun Tape  on August 5  1974  Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement  stating that he had a lapse of memory    He met with Republican congressional leaders soon after  and was told he faced certain impeachment in the House and had  at most  only 15 votes in his favor in the Senate far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office     In light of his loss of political support and the near certainty of impeachment  Nixon resigned the office of the presidency on August 9  1974  after addressing the nation on television the previous evening     The resignation speech was delivered from the Oval Office and was carried live on radio and television  Nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president  Gerald Ford  Nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency  especially in foreign policy    He defended his record as president  quoting from Theodore Roosevelt  s 1910 speech Citizenship in a Republic    Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed  but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena   whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood  who strives valiantly  who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming  but who does actually strive to do the deed  who knows the great enthusiasms  the great devotions  who spends himself in a worthy cause  who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst  if he fails  at least fails while daring greatly      Nixon s speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators  with only Roger Mudd of CBS stating that Nixon had not admitted wrongdoing    It was termed  a masterpiece  by Conrad Black   one of his biographers  Black opined that  What was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any American president  Nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue  He left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office      Following his resignation  the Nixons flew to their home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente  California     According to his biographer  Aitken   after his resignation   Nixon was a soul in torment     Congress had funded Nixon s transition costs  including some salary expenses  though reducing the appropriation from  850 000 to  200 000  With some of his staff still with him  Nixon was at his desk by 7a m with little to do    His former press secretary  Ron Ziegler   sat with him alone for hours each day     Nixon s resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished  The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon  though it would be unpopular in the country  Nixon  contacted by Ford emissaries  was initially reluctant to accept the pardon  but then agreed to do so  Ford  however  insisted on a statement of contrition  Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document  Ford eventually agreed  and on September 8  1974  he granted Nixon a  full  free  and absolute pardon   which ended any possibility of an indictment  Nixon then released a statement   I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate  particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy  No words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and the presidency  a nation I so deeply love  and an institution I so greatly respect       In October 1974  Nixon fell ill with phlebitis   Told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die  a reluctant Nixon chose surgery  and President Ford visited him in the hospital  Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aidesDean  Haldeman  and John Ehrlichman and The Washington Post   disbelieving his illness  printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the  wrong foot   Judge John Sirica excused Nixon s presence despite the defendants  objections    Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon s presidential papersbeginning a three decade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate    Nixon was in the hospital when the 1974 midterm elections were held  and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 43seats in the House and three in the Senate     In December 1974  Nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable ill will against him in the country  He wrote in his diary  referring to himself and Pat   So be it  We will see it through  We ve had tough times before and we can take the tougher ones that we will have to go through now  That is perhaps what we were made forto be able to take punishment beyond what anyone in this office has had before particularly after leaving office  This is a test of character and we must not fail the test     By early 1975  Nixon s health was improving  He maintained an office in a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home  at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day  he mainly worked on his memoirs    He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs  the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly    He was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in February  which compelled him to part with much of his staff  including Ziegler    In August of that year  he met with British talk show host and producer David Frost   who paid him  600 000 for a series of sit down interviews   filmed and aired in 1977    They began on the topic of foreign policy  recounting the leaders he had known  but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate  Nixon admitted that he had  let down the country  and that  I brought myself down  I gave them a sword and they stuck it in  And they twisted it with relish  And  I guess  if I d been in their position  I d have done the same thing     The interviews garnered 4550million viewersbecoming the most watched program of their kind in television history     The interviews helped improve Nixon s financial positionat one point in early 1975 he had only  500 in the bankas did the sale of his Key Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy Nixon friends such as Bebe Rebozo     In February 1976  Nixon visited China at the personal invitation of Mao  Nixon had wanted to return to China  but chose to wait until after Ford s own visit in 1975    Nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between Ford and Reagan  Ford won  but was defeated by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in the general election   The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia  causing the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to withhold its official invitation     In 1976  Nixon was disbarred in the state of New York for obstruction of justice in the Watergate affair  Nixon chose not to present any defense    In early 1978  Nixon went to the United Kingdom  He was shunned by American diplomats and by most ministers of the James Callaghan government  He was welcomed  however  by the Leader of the Opposition   Margaret Thatcher   as well as by former prime ministers Lord Home and Sir Harold Wilson   Two other former prime ministers  Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath declined to meet him  Nixon addressed the Oxford Union regarding Watergate   Some people say I didn t handle it properly and they re right  I screwed it up  Mea culpa   But let s get on to my achievements  You ll be here in the year 2000 and we ll see how I m regarded then     In 1978  Nixon published his memoirs  RN  The Memoirs of Richard Nixon   the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement    The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response    Nixon journeyed to the White House in 1979  invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping   Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon  but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited  Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid 1979     On August 10  1979  the Nixons purchased a New York City townhouse at 817 Fifth Avenue   after being rejected by two Manhattan co ops     When the former Shah of Iran died in Egypt in July 1980  Nixon defied the State Department  which intended to send no U S  representative  by attending the funeral  Though Nixon had no official credentials  as a former president he was seen as the American presence at its former ally s funeral    Nixon supported Ronald Reagan for president in 1980   making television appearances portraying himself as  in biographer Stephen Ambrose s words   the senior statesman above the fray     He wrote guest articles for many publications both during the campaign and after Reagan s victory    After eighteen months in the New York City townhouse  Nixon and his wife moved in 1981 to Saddle River   New Jersey     Throughout the 1980s  Nixon maintained an ambitious schedule of speaking engagements and writing    traveled  and met with many foreign leaders  especially those of Third World countries  He joined former Presidents Ford and Carter as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat     On a trip to the Middle East  Nixon made his views known regarding Saudi Arabia and Libya  which attracted significant U S  media attention  The Washington Post ran stories on Nixon s  rehabilitation     Nixon journeyed to the Soviet Union in 1986 and on his return sent President Reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of Mikhail Gorbachev     Following this trip  Nixon was ranked in a Gallup poll as one of the ten most admired men in the world     In 1986  Nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers  impressing his audience with his tour d horizon of the world    At the time  political pundit Elizabeth Drew wrote   Even when he was wrong  Nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory  as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority  enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times     Newsweek ran a story on  Nixon s comeback  with the headline  He s back      On July 19  1990  the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda   California opened as a private institution with the Nixons in attendance  They were joined by a large crowd of people  including Presidents Ford  Reagan  and George H  W  Bush   as well as their wives  Betty   Nancy   and Barbara     In January 1991  the former president founded the Nixon Center  today the Center for the National Interest    a Washington policy think tank and conference center     Pat Nixon died on June 22  1993  of emphysema and lung cancer  Her funeral services were held on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace  Former President Nixon was distraught throughout the interment and delivered a moving tribute to her inside the library building     Nixon suffered a severe stroke on April 18  1994  while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge   New Jersey home    A blood clot resulting from his heart condition had formed in his upper heart  broken off  and traveled to his brain  He was taken to New York HospitalCornell Medical Center in Manhattan   initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg    Damage to the brain caused swelling   cerebral edema    and Nixon slipped into a deep coma  He died at 9 08p m  on April 22  1994  with his daughters at his bedside  He was 81 years old     Nixon s funeral took place on April 27  1994 in Yorba Linda   California  Eulogists at the Nixon Library ceremony included President Bill Clinton   former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole   California Governor Pete Wilson   and the Reverend Billy Graham   Also in attendance were former Presidents Ford  Carter  Reagan  George H  W  Bush  and their wives     Richard Nixon is buried beside his wife Pat on the grounds of the Nixon Library  He was survived by his two daughters  Tricia and Julie   and four grandchildren    In keeping with his wishes  his funeral was not a full state funeral   though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service    Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly  wet weather to pay their respects    At its peak  the line to pass by Nixon s casket was three miles long with an estimated 42 000 people waiting to pay their respects     John F  Stacks of Time magazine said of Nixon shortly after his death   An outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every self created disaster that he faced  To reclaim a respected place in American public life after his resignation  he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the world s leaders    and by the time Bill Clinton came to the White House  in 1993   Nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman  Clinton  whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach Nixon  met openly with him and regularly sought his advice     Tom Wicker of The New York Times noted that Nixon had been equalled only by Franklin Roosevelt in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and  quoting Nixon s 1962 farewell speech  wrote   Richard Nixon s jowly  beard shadowed face  the ski jump nose and the widow s peak  the arms upstretched in the V sign  had been so often pictured and caricatured  his presence had become such a familiar one in the land  he had been so often in the heat of controversy  that it was hard to realize the nation really would not  have Nixon to kick around anymore      Ambrose said of the reaction to Nixon s death   To everyone s amazement  except his  he s our beloved elder statesman      Upon Nixon s death  almost all of the news coverage mentioned Watergate  but for the most part  the coverage was favorable to the former president  The Dallas Morning News stated   History ultimately should show that despite his flaws  he was one of our most farsighted chief executives     This offended some  columnist Russell Baker complained of  a group conspiracy to grant him absolution     Cartoonist Jeff Koterba of the Omaha World Herald depicted History before a blank canvas  his subject Nixon  as America looks on eagerly  The artist urges his audience to sit down  the work will take some time to complete  as  this portrait is a little more complicated than most      Historian and political scientist James MacGregor Burns observed of Nixon   How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president  so brilliant and so morally lacking     Nixon s biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history  According to Ambrose   Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished  What he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation     Irwin Gellman  who chronicled Nixon s congressional career  suggests that  he was remarkable among his congressional peers  a success story in a troubled era  one who steered a sensible anti Communist course against the excess of McCarthy     Aitken feels that  Nixon  both as a man and as a statesman  has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues  Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism  no simple verdict is possible      Nixon s Southern Strategy is credited by some historians as causing the South to become a Republican stronghold  though others deem economic factors more important to the change    Throughout his career  he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists  and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet communism    According to his biographer  Herbert Parmet   Nixon s role was to steer the Republican party along a middle course  somewhere between the competitive impulses of the Rockefellers  the Goldwaters  and the Reagans      Nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs  which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation  Historian Paul Charles Milazzo in his 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment  points to Nixon s creation of the EPA and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 Endangered Species Act   stating that  though unsought and unacknowledged  Richard Nixon s environmental legacy is secure      Nixon saw his policies regarding Vietnam  China  and the Soviets as key to his place in history    George McGovern   Nixon s onetime opponent  commented in 1983   President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers  China and the Soviet Union  than any other president since World War II    With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam  Nixon really will get high marks in history     Political scientist Jussi M  Hanhimki disagrees  saying Nixon s diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment   using diplomatic rather than military means     Historian Keith W  Olson has written that Nixon left a negative legacy  fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate    During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998  both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage  Republicans suggested that Clinton s misconduct had been comparable to Nixon s  while Democrats contended that Nixon s actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent    Another legacy  for a time  was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate  Olson suggests that grants of power to George W  Bush in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks restored the president s power     Nixon s career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public s perception of it  Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms  to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred  He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls  slumped shoulders  and a furrowed  sweaty brow     Nixon had a complex personality  both very secretive and awkward  yet strikingly reflective about himself  He was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects  wearing a coat and tie even when home alone    Nixon biographer Conrad Black described him as being  driven  though also  uneasy with himself in some ways     According to Black  Nixon  thought that he was doomed to be traduced  double crossed  unjustly harassed  misunderstood  underappreciated  and subjected to the trials of Job   but that by the application of his mighty will  tenacity  and diligence  he would ultimately prevail     Biographer Elizabeth Drew summarized Nixon as a  smart  talented man  but most peculiar and haunted of presidents     In his account of the Nixon presidency  author Richard Reeves described Nixon as  a strange man of uncomfortable shyness  who functioned best alone with his thoughts     Nixon s presidency was doomed by his personality  Reeves argues   He assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them    He clung to the idea of being  tough   He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness  But that was what betrayed him  He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness      Nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president  Even Bebe Rebozo  by some accounts his closest friend  did not call him by his first name  Nixon stated of this   Even with close friends  I don t believe in letting your hair down  confiding this and that and the other thingsaying   Gee  I couldn t sleep     I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself  That s just the way I am  Some people are different  Some people think it s good therapy to sit with a close friend and  you know  just spill your guts     and  reveal their inner psychewhether they were breast fed or bottle fed  Not me  No way     When told that most Americans  even at the end of his career  did not feel they knew him  Nixon replied   Yeah  it s true  And it s not necessary for them to know     ", "Ford": "Early life Scouting and athletics Education Naval service in World War II Marriage and children House of

move toward dtente in the Cold War   With the conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency  U S  involvement in Vietnam essentially ended   Domestically  Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression   with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure    One of his more controversial acts was to grant a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal   During Ford s presidency  foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play  and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President    In the GOP presidential primary campaign of 1976  Ford defeated former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination  He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger  former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter   on November 2   Following his years as President  Ford remained active in the Republican Party  After experiencing health problems  he died in his home on December 26  2006  Ford lived longer than any other U S  president   93 years and 165 days  while his 895 day presidency remains the

his paternal grandparents  His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner   and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr    a wool trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King  ne Porter   Dorothy separated from King just sixteen days after her son s birth  She took her son with her to the Oak Park  Illinois home of her sister Tannisse and brother in law  Clarence Haskins James  From there  she moved to the home of her parents  Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer in Grand Rapids  Michigan   Dorothy and King divorced in December 1913  she gained full custody of her son  Ford s paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930     Ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother    James M  Cannon  a member of the Ford administration  wrote in a biography of the Late president that the Kings  separation and divorce were sparked when  a few days after Ford s birth  Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife  his infant son  and Ford s nursemaid  Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man     After two and a half years with her parents  on February 1  1916  Dorothy married Gerald Rudolff Ford   a salesman in a family owned paint and varnish company  They then called her son Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr  The future president was never formally adopted   and did not legally change his name until December 3  1935  he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name    He was raised in Grand Rapids with his three half brothers from his mother s second marriage  Thomas Gardner Ford  19181995   Richard Addison Ford  born 1924   and James Francis Ford  19272001    Ford also had three half siblings from his father s second marriage  Marjorie King  19211993   Leslie Henry King  19231976   and Patricia Jane King  born 1925   They never saw one another as children and he did not know them at all  Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17  when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth  That year his biological father  Leslie King  whom Ford described as a  carefree  well to do man who didn t really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son   approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant  The two  maintained a sporadic contact  until Leslie King Sr  s death       Ford maintained his distance emotionally  saying   My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful  So I couldn t have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing      Ford was involved in the Boy Scouts of America   and earned that program s highest rank  Eagle Scout     In later years  Ford received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in May 1970 and Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy Scouts of America  He is the only Eagle Scout to have ascended to the U S  presidency    Scouting was so important to Ford that his family asked that Scouts participate in his funeral  About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession  where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum  A few selected Scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral     Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School and was a star athlete and captain of his football team    In 1930  he was selected to the All City team of the Grand Rapids City League   He also attracted the attention of college recruiters     Attending the University of Michigan as an undergraduate  Ford played center   linebacker and long snapper for the school s football team   and helped the Wolverines to undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933   The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year  however  winning only one game  Ford was the team s star nonetheless  and after a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota  the eventual national champion  to a scoreless tie in the first half  assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said   When I walked into the dressing room at halftime  I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them  Ford and  Cedric  Sweet played their hearts out  They were everywhere on defense   Ford later recalled   During 25 years in the rough and tumble world of politics  I often thought of the experiences before  during  and after that game in 1934  Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation  take action  and make every effort possible despite adverse odds   His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player  with one assistant coach noting   They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause      During Ford s senior year a controversy developed when the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets refused to play a scheduled game if a black player named Willis Ward took the field  Even after protests from students  players and alumni  university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game  Ford was Ward s best friend on the team and they roomed together while on road trips  Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the universitys decision  but eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play     During the same season  in a game against the University of Chicago   Ford became the only future U S  president to tackle a future Heisman Trophy winner when he brought down running back Jay Berwanger   who would win the first Heisman the following year    In 1934  Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner s East West Crippled Children game at San Francisco  a benefit for crippled children   played on January 1  1935  As part of the 1935 Collegiate All Star football team  Ford played against the Chicago Bears in the Chicago College All Star Game at Soldier Field     In honor of his athletic accomplishments and his later political career  the University of Michigan retired Ford s No  48 jersey in 1994  With the blessing of the Ford family  it was placed back into circulation in 2012 as part of the Michigan Football Legends program and issued to sophomore linebacker Desmond Morgan before a home game against Illinois on October 13     Ford remained interested in football and his school throughout life  occasionally attending games  Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices  at one point asking to join the players in the huddle    Ford often had the Naval band play the University of Michigan fight song  The Victors   before state events instead of Hail to the Chief     He also selected the song to be played during his funeral procession at the U S  Capitol    On his death in December 2006  the University of Michigan Marching Band played the fight song for him one final time  for his last ride from the Gerald R  Ford Airport in Grand Rapids  Michigan     Ford was also an avid golfer  In 1977  he shot a hole in one during a Pro am held in conjunction with the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic at Colonial Country Club in Memphis  Tennessee   He received the 1985 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America   GCSAA s highest honor     At Michigan  Ford became a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity  Omicron chapter  and washed dishes at his fraternity house to earn money for college expenses  Following his graduation in 1935 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics  he turned down contract offers from the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers of the National Football League to take a coaching position at Yale and apply to its law school    Ford continued to contribute to football and boxing  accepting an assistant coaching job for both at Yale in September 1935     Ford hoped to attend Yale s law school beginning in 1935 while serving as boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach  Yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school because of his full time coaching responsibilities  He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the University of Michigan Law School   and was eventually admitted in spring 1938 to Yale Law School     Ford earned his LL B  degree in 1941  later amended to Juris Doctor    graduating in the top 25 percent of his class  His introduction to politics came in the summer of 1940 when he worked in Wendell Willkie  s presidential campaign   While attending Yale Law School  he joined a group of students led by R  Douglas Stuart Jr    and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 Neutrality Act   The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the America First Committee   a group determined to keep the U S  out of World War II      Ford graduated from law school in 1941  and was admitted to the Michigan bar shortly thereafter  In May 1941  he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend  Philip W  Buchen     who would later serve as Ford s White House counsel  But overseas developments caused a change in plans  and Ford responded to the attack on Pearl Harbor by enlisting in the Navy     Ford received a commission as ensign in the U S  Naval Reserve on April 13  1942  On April 20  he reported for active duty to the V 5 instructor school at Annapolis  Maryland   After one month of training  he went to Navy Preflight School in Chapel Hill  North Carolina   where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills  ordnance  gunnery  first aid and military drill  In addition  he coached in all nine sports that were offered  but mostly in swimming  boxing and football  During the one year he was at the Preflight School  he was promoted to Lieutenant  Junior Grade on June 2  1942  and to Lieutenant in March 1943   Applying for sea duty  Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier USS Monterey  CVL 26    at New York Shipbuilding Corporation  Camden  New Jersey   From the ship s commissioning on June 17  1943  until the end of December 1944  Ford served as the assistant navigator  Athletic Officer  and antiaircraft battery officer on board the Monterey   While he was on board  the carrier participated in many actions in the Pacific Theater with the Third and Fifth Fleets in late 1943 and 1944  In 1943  the carrier helped secure Makin Island in the Gilberts  and participated in carrier strikes against Kavieng   New Ireland in 1943  During the spring of 1944  the Monterey supported landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and participated in carrier strikes in the Marianas   Western Carolines   and northern New Guinea   as well as in the Battle of the Philippine Sea     After overhaul  from September to November 1944  aircraft from the Monterey launched strikes against Wake Island   participated in strikes in the Philippines and Ryukyus   and supported the landings at Leyte and Mindoro      Although the ship was not damaged by Japanese forces  the Monterey was one of several ships damaged by the typhoon that hit Admiral William Halsey s Third Fleet on December 1819  1944   The Third Fleet lost three destroyers and over 800 men during the typhoon  The Monterey was damaged by a fire  which was started by several of the ship s aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck  During the storm  Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself  As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18  the ship rolled twenty five degrees  which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide toward the edge of the deck  The two inch steel ridge around the edge of the carrier slowed him enough so he could roll  and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck  As he later stated   I was lucky  I could have easily gone overboard    Ford  serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck  was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire  He did so safely  and reported his findings back to the ships commanding officer  Captain Stuart Ingersoll   The ships crew was able to contain the fire  and the ship got underway again     After the fire  the Monterey was declared unfit for service  and the crippled carrier reached Ulithi on December 21 before continuing across the Pacific to Bremerton  Washington where it underwent repairs  On December 24  1944  at Ulithi  Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre Flight School at Saint Mary s College of California   where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945  One of his duties was to coach football  From the end of April 1945 to January 1946  he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command  Naval Air Station  Glenview  Illinois as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer  On October 3  1945  he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander  In January 1946  he was sent to the Separation Center  Great Lakes to be processed out  He was released from active duty under honorable conditions on February 23  1946  On June 28  1946  the Secretary of the Navy accepted Ford s resignation from the Naval Reserve   For his naval service  Gerald Ford earned the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with nine engagement stars for operations in the Gilbert Islands   Bismarck Archipelago   Marshall Islands  Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids  Hollandia   Marianas  Western Carolines  Western New Guinea  and the Leyte Operation  He also received the Philippine Liberation Medal with two bronze stars for Leyte and Mindoro  as well as the American Campaign and World War II Victory Medals      Ford was a member of several civic organizations  including the Junior Chamber of Commerce  Jaycees   American Legion   AMVETS   Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks   Sons of the Revolution     and Veterans of Foreign Wars    In 1992 the U S  Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Ford its Lone Sailor Award for his naval service and his subsequent government service   Gerald R  Ford was initiated into Freemasonry on September 30  1949    He later said in 1975   When I took my obligation as a master masonincidentally  with my three younger brothersI recalled the value my own father attached to that order  But I had no idea that I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States      On October 15  1948  at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids  Ford married Elizabeth Bloomer Warren  19182011   a department store fashion consultant  Warren had been a John Robert Powers fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the Martha Graham Dance Company  She had previously been married to and divorced from William G  Warren   At the time of his engagement  Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of thirteen terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives  The wedding was delayed until shortly before the elections because  as The New York Times reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford   Jerry was running for Congress and wasn t sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex dancer      The couple had four children   After returning to Grand Rapids  Ford became active in local Republican politics  and supporters urged him to take on Bartel J  Jonkman   the incumbent Republican congressman  Military service had changed his view of the world   I came back a converted internationalist    Ford wrote   and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed  dedicated isolationist   And I thought he ought to be replaced  Nobody thought I could win  I ended up winning two to one      During his first campaign in 1948   Ford visited voters at their doorsteps and as they left the factories where they worked    Ford also visited local farms where  in one instance  a wager resulted in Ford spending two weeks milking cows following his election victory    Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a  Congressman s Congressman      Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years  holding the Grand Rapids congressional district seat from 1949 to 1973  It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty  As an editorial in The New York Times described him  Ford  saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler  and the record shows it  he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career     Appointed to the House Appropriations Committee two years after being elected  he was a prominent member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee   Ford described his philosophy as  a moderate in domestic affairs  an internationalist in foreign affairs  and a conservative in fiscal policy      In the early 1950s  Ford declined offers to run for either the Senate or the Michigan governorship  Rather  his ambition was to become Speaker of the House      On November 29  1963  President Lyndon B  Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission   a special task force set up to investigate the assassination of President John F  Kennedy     Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of Lee Harvey Oswald   the accused assassin  According to a 1963 FBI memo released in 2008  Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director  Cartha DeLoach   about the panel s activities        In the preface to his book  A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission   Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions     In 1964  Democratic President Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party  securing another term as president and taking 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives  Following the election  members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader  Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve  after consulting with his family  he agreed  After a closely contested election  Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as Minority Leader     The Republicans had 140 seats in the House compared with the 295 seats held by the Democrats  Consequently  the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the   Great Society    During the first session of the Eighty ninth Congress alone  the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress  and Johnson signed 84  or 96   arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history     Criticism over the Johnson Administration s handling of the Vietnam War began to grow in 1966  with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war  Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson  and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47 seat swing in favor of the Republicans  This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House  but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs     Ford s private criticism of the Vietnam War became public following a speech from the floor of the House  in which he questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion    The speech angered President Johnson  who accused Ford of playing  too much football without a helmet        As Minority Leader in the House  Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen   in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson s policies  Many in the press jokingly called this  The Ev and Jerry Show     Johnson said at the time   Jerry Ford is so dumb he can t fart and chew gum at the same time     The press  used to sanitizing LBJ s salty language  reported this as  Gerald Ford can t walk and chew gum at the same time      Ford s role shifted under President Nixon to being an advocate for the White House agenda  Congress passed several of Nixon s proposals  including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969   Another high profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act  Passed in 1972  the act established a Revenue Sharing program for state and local governments    Ford s leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress  and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor  compared with 185 against        During the 8 years  19651973  he served as Minority Leader  Ford won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality    An office building in the U S  Capitol Complex  House Annex 2  was renamed for Gerald Ford as the Ford House Office Building    On October 10  1973  Vice President Agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering  part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted  29 500 in bribes while governor of Maryland  According to The New York Times   Nixon  sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement  The advice was unanimous   We gave Nixon no choice but Ford   House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later      Ford was nominated to take Agnew s position on October 12  the first time the vice presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented  The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27  Only three Senators  all Democrats  voted against Ford s confirmation  Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin   Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and William Hathaway of Maine   On December 6  the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35  One hour after the confirmation vote in the House  Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States   Following Ford s appointment  the Watergate investigation continued until Chief of Staff Alexander Haig contacted Ford on Thursday  August 1  1974  and told him that   smoking gun   evidence had been found  The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover up  At the time  Ford and his wife  Betty  were living in suburban Virginia  waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president s residence in Washington  D C  However   Al Haig  asked  to come over and see me   Ford later related   to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday  and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation  And he said   I m just warning you that you ve got to be prepared  that things might change dramatically and you could become President   And I said   Betty  I don t think we re ever going to live in the vice president s house          When Nixon resigned on August 9  1974  Ford assumed the presidency  making him the only person to assume the presidency without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office  Immediately after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House  he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation    Ford noted the peculiarity of his position   I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots  and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers     He went on to state   I have not sought this enormous responsibility  but I will not shirk it  Those who nominated and confirmed me as Vice President were my friends and are my friends  They were of both parties  elected by all the people and acting under the Constitution in their name  It is only fitting then that I should pledge to them and to you that I will be the President of all the people     He also stated   My fellow Americans  our long national nightmare is over  Our Constitution works  our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men  Here  the people rule  But there is a higher Power  by whatever name we honor Him  who ordains not only righteousness but love  not only justice  but mercy      let us restore the golden rule to our political process  and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and hate     A portion of the speech would later be memorialized with a plaque at the entrance to his presidential museum    On August 20  Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated    Rockefeller s top competitor had been George H  W  Bush   Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress  which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides  such as Henry Kissinger   Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked  most of them voted for his confirmation  and his nomination passed both the House and Senate  Some  including Barry Goldwater   voted against him     On September 8  1974  Ford issued Proclamation 4311   which gave Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while President        In a televised broadcast to the nation  Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country  and that the Nixon family s situation  is a tragedy in which we all have played a part  It could go on and on and on  or someone must write the end to it  I have concluded that only I can do that  and if I can  I must      The Nixon pardon was highly controversial  Critics derided the move and claimed a   corrupt bargain   had been struck between the men    They claimed Ford s pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon s resignation that elevated Ford to the presidency  Ford s first press secretary and close friend Jerald terHorst resigned his post in protest after the pardon  According to Bob Woodward   Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford  He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons  primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared    Regardless  historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the election in 1976   an observation with which Ford agreed    In an editorial at the time  The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was a  profoundly unwise  divisive and unjust act  that in a stroke had destroyed the new president s  credibility as a man of judgment  candor and competence     On October 17  1974  Ford testified before Congress on the pardon  He was the first sitting President to testify before Congress since Abraham Lincoln      After Ford left the White House in 1977  the former President privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of Burdick v  United States   a 1915 U S  Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt  and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt    In 2001  the John F  Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F  Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon    In presenting the award to Ford  Senator Ted Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon of Nixon  but later stated that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision     On September 16  shortly after he announced the Nixon pardon  Ford introduced a conditional amnesty program for Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada as well as for military deserters  The conditions of the amnesty required that those involved reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job    Full pardon for the draft dodgers  however  did not come about until the Carter Administration    The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters   established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a Presidential Pardon and a change in Military discharge status   Upon assuming office  Ford inherited Nixon s Cabinet   During Ford s brief administration  only Secretary of State Kissinger and Secretary of the Treasury William E  Simon remained  Ford appointed William Coleman as Secretary of Transportation   the second black man to serve in a presidential cabinet  after Robert Clifton Weaver   and the first appointed in a Republican administration     Other cabinet level posts   Other important posts   Ford selected George H W  Bush as Chief of the US Liaison Office to the People s Republic of China in 1974  and then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency in late 1975     Ford s transition chairman and first Chief of Staff was former congressman and ambassador Donald Rumsfeld   In 1975  Rumsfeld was named by Ford as the youngest ever Secretary of Defense   Ford chose a young Wyoming politician  Richard Cheney   to replace Rumsfeld as his new Chief of Staff and later campaign manager for Ford s 1976 presidential campaign     Ford s dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet in the fall of 1975 has been referred to by political commentators as the   Halloween Massacre     The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place fewer than three months after Ford assumed office and in the wake of the Watergate scandal  The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections   taking 49 seats from the Republican Party  and increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats  This was one more than the number needed  290  for a two thirds majority  necessary to override a Presidential veto  or to propose a constitutional amendment   Perhaps due in part to this fact  the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States  18651869     Even Ford s old  reliably Republican seat was taken by Democrat Richard Vander Veen   defeating Republican Robert VanderLaan   In the Senate elections   the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100 seat body     The economy was a great concern during the Ford administration  One of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create the Economic Policy Board by Executive Order on September 30  1974    In response to rising inflation  Ford went before the American public in October 1974 and asked them to   W hip I nflation N ow   As part of this program  he urged people to wear   WIN   buttons    At the time  inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy  more so than growing unemployment  They felt as though controlling inflation would work to fix unemployment    To rein in inflation  it was necessary to control the public s spending  To try to mesh service and sacrifice   WIN  called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption    On October 4  1974  Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress and as a part of this speech kicked off the  WIN  campaign  Over the next nine days 101 240 Americans mailed in  WIN  pledges    In hindsight  this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick without offering any means of solving the underlying problems    The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one year  five percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals  This plan would also take  4 4billion out of the budget  bringing federal spending below  300billion    At the time  inflation was over twelve percent     Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic   In the early 1970s  an influenza strain H1N1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans  On February 5  1976  an army recruit at Fort Dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized  health officials announced that  swine flu  was the cause  Soon after  public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be vaccinated     Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems  some 25  of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December of that year  The vaccine was blamed for twenty five deaths  more people died from the shots than from the swine flu     Ford was an outspoken supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment   issuing Presidential Proclamation no  4383 in 1975   In this Land of the Free  it is right  and by nature it ought to be  that all men and all women are equal before the law   Now  therefore  I  Gerald R  Ford  President of the United States of America  to remind all Americans that it is fitting and just to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment adopted by the Congress of the United States of America  in order to secure legal equality for all women and men  do hereby designate and proclaim August 26  1975  as Women s Equality Day     As president  Ford s position on abortion was that he supported  a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the 50 States to make the choice     This had also been his position as House Minority Leader in response to the 1973 Supreme Court case of Roe v  Wade   which he opposed    Ford came under criticism for a 60 Minutes interview his wife Betty gave in 1975  in which she stated that Roe v  Wade was a  great  great decision     During his later life  Ford would identify as pro choice      The federal budget ran a deficit every year Ford was President    Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting   Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975  which established special education throughout the United States  Ford expressed  strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children  according to the official White House press release for the bill signing     The economic focus began to change as the country sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression four decades earlier    The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment  which reached nine percent in May 1975    In January 1975  Ford proposed a 1 year tax reduction of  16billion to stimulate economic growth  along with spending cuts to avoid inflation    Ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction  In Congress  the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to  22 8billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts    In March 1975  Congress passed  and Ford signed into law  these income tax rebates as part of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975   This resulted in a federal deficit of around  53billion for the 1975 fiscal year and  73 7billion for 1976     When New York City faced bankruptcy in 1975  Mayor Abraham Beame was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford s support for a federal bailout  The incident prompted the New York Daily News   famous headline  Ford to City  Drop Dead   referring to a speech in which  Ford declared flatly     that he would veto any bill calling for  a federal bail out of New York City          The following month  November 1975  Ford changed his stance and asked Congress to approve federal loans to New York City     Ford continued the dtente policy with both the Soviet Union and China  easing the tensions of the Cold War  Still in place from the Nixon Administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty  SALT     The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon s visit to China was reinforced by Ford s December 1975 visit to the communist country    In 1975  the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords   with the Soviet Union  creating the framework of the Helsinki Watch   an independent non governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch      Ford attended the inaugural meeting of the Group of Seven  G7  industrialized nations  initially the G5  in 1975 and secured membership for Canada  Ford supported international solutions to issues   We live in an interdependent world and  therefore  must work together to resolve common economic problems   he said in a 1974 speech     In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean  two ongoing international disputes developed into crises  The Cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus   causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  alliance  In mid August  the government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure  in mid September 1974  the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey  Ford  concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO s eastern front  vetoed the bill  A second bill was passed by the house  and vetoed  although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year    As Ford expected  Turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978    In the continuing Arab Israeli conflict   although the initial cease fire had been implemented to end active conflict in the Yom Kippur War   Kissinger s continuing shuttle diplomacy was showing little progress  Ford considered it  stalling  and wrote   Their  Israeli  tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell     During Kissinger s shuttle to Israel in early March 1975  a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal  prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin   which included   I wish to express my profound disappointment over Israel s attitude in the course of the negotiations     Failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations  I have given instructions for a reassessment of United States policy in the region  including our relations with Israel  with the aim of ensuring that overall American interests     are protected  You will be notified of our decision     On March 24  Ford received congressional leaders of both parties and informed them of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East   Reassessment   in practical terms  meant to cancel or suspend further aid to Israel  For six months between March and September 1975  the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel  Rabin notes it was  an innocent sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American Israeli relations     As could be expected  the announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel s well wishers in Congress  On May 21  Ford  experienced a real shock   seventy six senators wrote him a letter urging him to be  responsive  to Israel s request for  2 59billion in military and economic aid  Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized  It was  since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey  the second major congressional intrusion upon the President s  foreign policy  prerogatives    The following summer months were described by Ford as an American Israeli  war of nerves  or  test of wills     and after much bargaining  the Sinai Interim Agreement  Sinai II   was formally signed on September 1 and aid resumed   One of Ford s greatest challenges was dealing with the continued Vietnam War  American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords   signed on January 27  1973  The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam  and required the release of American prisoners of war   The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and  like the Geneva Conference of 1954  called for national elections in the North and South  The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty day period for the total withdrawal of U S  forces     The accords had been negotiated by United States National Security Advisor Kissinger and North Vietnamese politburo member Le Duc Tho   South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu was not involved in the final negotiations  and publicly criticized the proposed agreement  However  anti war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces  In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president  Nixon had promised that the United States would defend his government  should the North Vietnamese violate the accords     In December 1974  months after Ford took office  North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of Phuoc Long   General Tr n V n Tr sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion  as well as to solve logistical issues before proceeding with the invasion     As North Vietnamese forces advanced  Ford requested aid for South Vietnam in a  522million aid package  The funds had been promised by the Nixon administration  but Congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin    Senator Jacob Javits offered     large sums for evacuation  but not one nickel for military aid     President Thieu resigned on April 21  1975  publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country    Two days later  on April 23  Ford gave a speech at Tulane University   In that speech  he announced that the Vietnam War was over     as far as America is concerned     The announcement was met with thunderous applause     1 373 U S  citizens and 5 595 Vietnamese and third country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon during Operation Frequent Wind   Military and Air America helicopters took evacuees to U S  Navy ships off shore during an approximately 24 hour period on April 29 to 30  1975  immediately preceding the fall of Saigon   During the operation  so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people  Other helicopters  having nowhere to land  were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers  close to the ships  their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats     Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act   The 1975 Act appropriated  455million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of Indochinese refugees    In all  130 000 Vietnamese refugees came to the United States in 1975  Thousands more escaped in the years that followed     North Vietnam s victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia  and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U S  influence there  The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions  once when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone  DMZ  between North and South Korea     The first crisis was the Mayaguez Incident   In May 1975  shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of Cambodia   Cambodians seized the American merchant ship Mayaguez in international waters    Ford dispatched Marines to rescue the crew  but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as  unknown to the U S   the Mayaguez sailors were being released  In the operation  two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down  and 41 U S  servicemen were killed and 50 wounded while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed    Despite the American losses  the operation was seen as a success in the United States and Ford enjoyed an 11 point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath    The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in Washington  D C   Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot    But recent work by Andrew Gawthorpe  based on an analysis of the administration s internal discussions  shows that Ford s national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local  and perhaps even accidental  provocation by an immature Khmer government  Nevertheless  they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia     The second crisis  known as the axe murder incident   occurred at Panmunjom   a village which stands in the DMZ between the two Koreas  At the time  this was the only part of the DMZ where forces from the North and the South came into contact with each other  Encouraged by U S  difficulties in Vietnam  North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the U S  to withdraw from South Korea    Then  in August 1976  North Korean forces killed two U S  officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom s Joint Security Area   The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of Non Aligned Nations in Colombo   Sri Lanka  at which Kim Jong il   the son of North Korean leader Kim Il sung   presented the incident as an example of American aggression  helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U S  withdrawal from the South     At administration meetings  Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U S  as  the paper tigers of Saigon  if they did not respond  and Ford agreed with that assessment  After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major show of force   A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree  while at the same time the air force was deployed  which included B 52 bomber flights over Panmunjom  The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree cutting to go ahead  and later issued an unprecedented official apology     East Timor  s decolonization due to political instability in Portugal saw Indonesia posture to annex the new state in 1975  Just hours before the Indonesian invasion of East Timor  now Timor Leste  on December 7  1975  Ford and Kissinger had visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta and guaranteed American compliance with the Indonesian operation  Suharto had been a key supporter of American influence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia and Ford did not desire to place pressure on the American Indonesian relationship     Under Ford  a policy of arms sales to the Suharto regime began in 1975  before the invasion   Roughly 90   of the Indonesian army s weapons at the time of East Timor s invasion were provided by the U S  according to George H  Aldrich  a former State Department Deputy Legal Advisor s hearing at the 1977 House International Relations Committee hearing  Post invasion  Ford s military aid averaged about  30 million annually throughout East Timor s occupation   and arms sales increased exponentially under President Carter  This policy continued until 1999     Ford faced two assassination attempts during his presidency  occurring within three weeks of each other and in the same state  while in Sacramento  California   on September 5  1975  Lynette  Squeaky  Fromme   a follower of Charles Manson   pointed a Colt  45 caliber handgun at Ford    As Fromme pulled the trigger  Larry Buendorf     a Secret Service agent  grabbed the gun and Fromme was taken into custody  She was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison  she was paroled on August 14  2009     In reaction to this attempt  the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds  a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later  as he left the St  Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco  Sara Jane Moore   standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street  pointed her  38 caliber revolver at him    Moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off  Just before she fired a second round  retired Marine Oliver Sipple grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot  the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of Ford s head  then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver  who was slightly wounded  Moore was later sentenced to life in prison  She was paroled on December 31  2007  having served 32 years     In 1975  Ford appointed John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice William O  Douglas   Stevens had been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit   appointed by President Nixon    During his tenure as House Republican leader  Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached    After being confirmed  Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the Court s liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues    Nevertheless  President Ford paid tribute to Stevens   He has served his nation well   Ford said of Stevens   with dignity  intellect and without partisan political concerns      In addition to the Stevens appointment  Ford appointed 11 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals  and 50 judges to the United States district courts      Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976  but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination  Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party s conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam   for signing the Helsinki Accords and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal  negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter  who eventually signed the Torrijos Carter Treaties    Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries   including North Carolina   Texas   Indiana   and California   before withdrawing from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City   Missouri   The conservative insurgency had already convinced Ford to drop the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U S  Senator Bob Dole of Kansas      In addition to the pardon dispute and lingering anti Republican sentiment  Ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery  Chevy Chase often did pratfalls on Saturday Night Live   imitating Ford  who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term  As Chase commented   He even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree      President Ford s 1976 election campaign had the advantage that he was an incumbent president during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the United States Bicentennial   The Washington  D C  fireworks display on the Fourth of July was presided over by the President and televised nationally    On July 7  1976  the President and First Lady served as hosts at a White House state dinner for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the United Kingdom  which was televised on the Public Broadcasting Service network  The 200th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts gave Ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110 000 in Concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for  reconciliation  not recrimination  and  reconstruction  not rancor  between the United States and those who would pose  threats to peace     Speaking in New Hampshire on the previous day  Ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to  basic American virtues      Democratic nominee and former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter campaigned as an outsider and reformer  gaining support from voters dismayed by the Watergate scandal and Nixon pardon  After the Democratic National Convention  he held a huge 33 point lead over Ford in the polls  However  as the campaign continued  the race tightened  and  by election day  the polls showed the race as too close to call  There were three main events in the fall campaign  Most importantly  Carter repeated a promise of a  blanket pardon  for Christian and other religious refugees  and also all Vietnam War draft dodgers  Ford had only issued a conditional amnesty  in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates  an act which froze Ford s poll numbers in Ohio  Wisconsin  Hawaii  and Mississippi   Ford had needed to shift just 11 000 votes in Ohio plus one of the other three in order to win   It was the first act signed by Carter  on January 20  1977  Earlier  Playboy magazine had published a controversial interview with Carter  in the interview Carter admitted to having  lusted in my heart  for women other than his wife  which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians  Also  on September 24  Ford performed well in what was the first televised presidential debate since 1960   Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner  Carter was also hurt by Ford s charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader  and that Carter was vague on many issues   Televised presidential debates were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election  As such  Ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one  Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates  saying they  gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer   The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating   There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration   Ford also said that he did not  believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union     In an interview years later  Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence  However  the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response    As a result of this blunder  and Carter s promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates  Ford s surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls   In the end  Carter won the election  receiving 50 1  of the popular vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 48 0  and 240 electoral votes for Ford  The election was close enough that had fewer than 25 000 votes shifted in Ohio and Wisconsin  both of which neighbored his home state  Ford would have won the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for Carter    Though he lost  in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election Ford managed to close what was once an alleged 33 point Carter lead to a 2 point margin  Despite his defeat  Ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by Carter   Had Ford won the election  the provisions of the 22nd Amendment would have disqualified him from running in 1980   because he had served more than two years of Nixon s remaining term   The Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided  Ford s successor  Jimmy Carter  opened his 1977 inaugural address by praising the outgoing President  saying   For myself and for our Nation  I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land      Ford remained relatively active in the years after his presidency and continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation  such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services  In January 1977  he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia then served as its chairman of the board of trustees from 1980 to 1986    Later in the year  he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M  Naughton  a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President s advance obituary  an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication    In 1979  Ford published his autobiography  A Time to Heal  Harper Reader s Digest  454 pages   A review in Foreign Affairs described it as   Serene  unruffled  unpretentious  like the author  This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs  but there are no surprises  no deep probings of motives or events  No more here than meets the eye     In addition to his autobiography  in 1987 Ford wrote Humor and the Presidency   a book of humorous political anecdotes   During the term of office of his successor  Jimmy Carter  Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter s senior staff on international and domestic issues  and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington  D C  Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office  with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of Anwar el Sadat in 1981    Until Ford s death  Carter and his wife  Rosalynn   visited the Fords  home frequently    Ford and Carter served as honorary co chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the Continuity of Government Commission in 2002   Like Presidents Carter  George H W  Bush  and Clinton   Ford was an honorary co chair of the Council for Excellence in Government   a group dedicated to excellence in government performance  which provides leadership training to top federal employees   Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in 1980   foregoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter  Ford attacked Carter s conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa  Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an  Accidental President  and to win a term in his own right  Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term  Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger as well as Jim Rhodes of Ohio and Bill Clements of Texas to make the race  On March 15  1980  Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination  vowing to support the eventual nominee   After securing the Republican nomination in 1980  Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice presidential running mate  but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful  Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan s agreement to an unprecedented  co presidency     giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments  such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary   After rejecting these terms  Reagan offered the vice presidential nomination instead to George H W  Bush    Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan Bush ticket  in which he declared that the country would be  better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter      After his presidency  Ford joined the American Enterprise Institute as a distinguished fellow  He founded the annual AEI World Forum in 1982  Ford was awarded an honorary doctorate at Central Connecticut State University   on March 23  1988   After leaving the White House  Ford and his wife moved to Denver  Colorado  Ford successfully invested in oil with Marvin Davis   which later provided an income for Ford s children     By 1988  Ford was a member of several corporate boards including Commercial Credit  Nova Pharmaceutical  The Pullman Company  Tesoro Petroleum  and Tiger International  Inc    Ford also became an honorary director of Citigroup   a position he held till his death     In 1977  he established the Gerald R  Ford Institute of Public Policy at Albion College in Albion  Michigan   to give undergraduates training in public policy  In April 1981  he opened the Gerald R  Ford Library in Ann Arbor  Michigan   on the north campus of his alma mater  the University of Michigan     followed in September by the Gerald R  Ford Museum in Grand Rapids      In 1999  Ford was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bill Clinton    In 2001  he was presented with the John F  Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award for his decision to pardon Richard Nixon to stop the agony America was experiencing over Watergate    In retirement Ford also devoted much time to his love of golf  often playing both privately and in public events with comedian Bob Hope   a longtime friend   A Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to Ford in 1993     In April 1991  Ford joined former presidents Richard Nixon   Ronald Reagan   and Jimmy Carter   in supporting the Brady Bill     Three years later  he wrote to the U S  House of Representatives   along with Carter and Reagan  in support of the assault weapons ban      In October 2001  Ford broke with conservative members of the Republican party by stating that gay and lesbian couples  ought to be treated equally  Period   He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians  stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters    He also was a member of the Republican Unity Coalition  which The New York Times described as  a group of prominent Republicans  including former President Gerald R  Ford  dedicated to making sexual orientation a non issue in the Republican Party      On November 22  2004  New York Republican Governor George Pataki named Ford and the other living former Presidents  Carter  George H W  Bush and Bill Clinton  as honorary members of the board rebuilding the World Trade Center    In a pre recorded embargoed interview with Bob Woodward of The Washington Post in July 2004  Ford stated that he disagreed  very strongly  with the Bush administration s choice of Iraq s alleged weapons of mass destruction as justification for its decision to invade Iraq   calling it a  big mistake  unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been President  The details of the interview were not released until after Ford s death  as he requested       As Ford approached his 90th year  he began to experience health problems associated with old age  He suffered two minor strokes at the 2000 Republican National Convention   but made a quick recovery after being admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital       In January 2006  he spent 11 days at the Eisenhower Medical Center near his residence at Rancho Mirage  California   for treatment of pneumonia     On April 23  President George W  Bush visited Ford at his home in Rancho Mirage for a little over an hour  This was Ford s last public appearance and produced the last known public photos  video footage and voice recording  While vacationing in Vail  Colorado   he was hospitalized for two days in July 2006 for shortness of breath    On August 15 Ford was admitted to St  Mary s Hospital of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  Minnesota   for testing and evaluation  On August 21  it was reported that he had been fitted with a pacemaker   On August 25  he underwent an angioplasty procedure at the Mayo Clinic  according to a statement from an assistant to Ford  On August 28  Ford was released from the hospital and returned with his wife Betty to their California home  On October 13  he was scheduled to attend the dedication of a building of his namesake  the Gerald R  Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan  but due to poor health and on the advice of his doctors he did not attend  The previous day  Ford entered the Eisenhower Medical Center for undisclosed tests  he was released on October 16    By November 2006  he was confined to a bed in his study    In reality  President Ford had end stage coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency  caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves     Ford died on December 26  2006  at his home in Rancho Mirage  California   of arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis   His age at the time of his death was 93 years and 165 days  making Ford the longest lived U S  President    On December 30  2006  Ford became the 11th U S  President to lie in state   The burial was preceded by a state funeral and memorial services held at the National Cathedral in Washington  D C   on January 2  2007  After the service  Ford was interred at his Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids  Michigan     Ford died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry Truman  s death  He was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission     His wife  Betty Ford  died on July 8  2011    Like her husband  she also died at age 93   The State of Michigan commissioned and submitted a statue of Ford to the National Statuary Hall Collection   replacing Zachariah Chandler   It was unveiled on May 3  2011 in the Capitol Rotunda  On the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by Thomas P   Tip  O Neill  Speaker of the House at the end of Fords presidency   God has been good to America  especially during difficult times  At the time of the Civil War  he gave us Abraham Lincoln  And at the time of Watergate  he gave us Gerald Fordthe right man at the right time who was able to put our nation back together again   On the proper left side are words from Ford s swearing in address   Our constitution works  Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men  Here the people rule    Ford was the longest lived U S  President   his lifespan being 45 days longer than Ronald Reagan s  He was the third longest lived Vice President   falling short only of John Nance Garner   98  and Levi P  Morton   96  Ford also had the third longest post presidency  29 years and 11 months  after Jimmy Carter  34 years 9 months and counting  and Herbert Hoover  31 years and 7 months   On November 12  2006  upon surpassing Ronald Reagan s lifespan  Ford released his last public statement   The length of one s days matters less than the love of one s family and friends  I thank God for the gift of every sunrise and  even more  for all the years He has blessed me with Betty and the children  with our extended family and the friends of a lifetime  That includes countless Americans who  in recent months  have remembered me in their prayers  Your kindness touches me deeply  May God bless you all and may God bless America     Ford was the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president  The choice of Ford to fulfill Agnew s vacated role as vice president was based on his reputation for openness and honesty     In all the years I sat in the House  I never knew Mr  Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part true and part false  He never attempted to shade a statement  and I never heard him utter an unkind word   said Martha Griffiths      The trust the American people had in him was severely and rapidly tarnished by his pardon of Nixon    Nonetheless  many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought    His subsequent loss to Carter in 1976 has come to be seen as an honorable sacrifice he made for the nation     In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments  Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy  likable and simple minded Everyman  An incident in 1975 when he tripped while exiting the presidential jet in Austria  was famously and repetitively parodied by Chevy Chase   cementing Ford s image as a klutz        Pieces of Ford s common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford s inevitable comparison to Nixon  as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self deprecation    Ridicule often extended to supposed intellectual limitations  with Lyndon B  Johnson once joking   He s a nice fellow but he spent too much time playing football without a helmet      Ford was honored with a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in 1999    And the following facilities were

abolitionist movement as a fundamental threat to the unity of the nation    His polarizing actions in championing and signing the KansasNebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act failed to stem intersectional conflict  setting the stage for Southern secession   Born in New Hampshire   Pierce served in the U S  House of Representatives and the Senate until he resigned from the latter in 1842  His private law practice in his home state was a success  he was appointed U S  Attorney for his state in 1845  Pierce took part in the MexicanAmerican War as a brigadier general in the Army   Seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests  he was nominated as the party s candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the 1852 Democratic National Convention   In the 1852 presidential election   Pierce and his running mate William R  King easily defeated the Whig Party ticket of Winfield Scott and William A  Graham    While Pierce was popular and outgoing  his family life was a grim affair  with his wife Jane suffering from illness and depression for much of her life    All of their children died young  their last son being gruesomely killed in a train accident while the family was traveling shortly before Pierce s inauguration  As president  Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage  an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him  Pierce was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain  He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan  while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability  but these successes were overshadowed by political strife   His popularity in the Northern states declined sharply after he supported the KansasNebraska Act  which nullified the Missouri Compromise   while many whites in the South continued to support him  Passage of the act led to violent conflict over the expansion of slavery in the American West   Pierce s administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the Ostend Manifesto   calling for the annexation of Cuba  a document which was roundly criticized  Although Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the 1856 presidential election   he was abandoned by his party and his bid failed  His reputation in the North suffered further during the Civil War as he became a vocal critic of President Abraham Lincoln   Pierce  who had been a heavy drinker for much of his life  died of severe cirrhosis of the liver in 1869   US historians and other political commentators generally rank Pierce s presidency among the worst      Franklin Pierce was born on November 23  1804  in a log cabin in Hillsborough   in the northeastern state of New Hampshire   He was a sixth generation descendant of Thomas Pierce  who had moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from Norwich  County Norfolk   England  in about 1634  Pierce s father Benjamin   a Revolutionary War lieutenant  moved from Chelmsford  Massachusetts to Hillsborough after the war  purchasing 50 acres  20ha  of land  Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife  Anna Kendrick  his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth  leaving a daughter   Benjamin was by then a prominent Democratic Republican   note 2   state legislator  farmer  and tavern keeper  During Pierce s childhood his father was deeply involved in state politics  while two of his older brothers fought in the War of 1812   public affairs and the military were thus a major influence in his early life     Pierce s father  who sought to ensure that his sons were educated  placed Pierce in a school at Hillsborough Center in childhood and sent him to the town school at Hancock at the age of 12    The boy was not fond of schooling  Growing homesick at Hancock  he walked 12 miles  19km  back to his home one Sunday  His father fed him dinner and drove him part of the distance back to school before kicking him out of the carriage and ordering him to walk the rest of the way in a thunderstorm  Pierce later cited this moment as  the turning point in my life     Later that year he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy to prepare for college  By this time he had built a reputation as a charming student  sometimes prone to misbehavior     In fall 1820  Pierce entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick  Maine   one of nineteen freshmen  He joined the Athenian Society  a progressive literary society  alongside Jonathan Cilley  later elected to Congress  and Nathaniel Hawthorne  the author   with whom he formed lasting friendships  Last in his class after two years  he worked hard to improve his grades and in 1824 graduated in fifth place   in a graduating class of fourteen    In Pierce s junior year  John P  Hale   a later political ally and then rival of Pierce s  also enrolled at Bowdoin  That year  Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company  the Bowdoin Cadets  which included Cilley and Hawthorne  The unit performed drill on campus near the president s house until the noise caused him to demand it halt  The students rebelled and went on strike  an event Pierce was suspected of leading    During his final year at Bowdoin  he spent several months teaching at a school in rural Hebron  Maine   where his students included future Congressman John J  Perry   and he earned his first salary       After briefly reading law with former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury   a family friend  in Portsmouth     he spent a semester at Northampton Law School in Northampton  Massachusetts   followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst  New Hampshire   He was admitted to the bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough    Pierce lost his first case  but soon proved capable as a lawyer  Despite never being a legal scholar  his memory for names and faces served him well  as did his personal charm and deep voice    In Hillsborough  his law partner was Albert Baker  who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy      By 1824  New Hampshire was a hotbed of partisanship  with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill laying the groundwork for a party of Democrats in support of General Andrew Jackson   They opposed the established Federalists  and their successors  the National Republicans    who were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams   The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827  when their pro Jackson nominee  Benjamin Pierce  won the support of the pro Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed  While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney  he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached  In the state elections held in March 1828  the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce  voting him out of office    note 3   but Franklin Pierce won his first election  Hillsborough town moderator   a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years     Pierce actively campaigned in his district on behalf of Jackson  who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election  even though he lost New Hampshire   The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party  and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year  representing Hillsborough in the New Hampshire House of Representatives   Pierce s father  meanwhile  was elected again as governor  retiring after that term  The younger Pierce was appointed as chairman of the House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year  By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority  and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House  The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking  protect the state militia  and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson s re election effort  At the age of 27  he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party  Though attaining early political and professional success  in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough     Like all white males in New Hampshire between the ages of 18 and 45  Pierce was a member of the state militia   and was appointed aide de camp to Governor Samuel Dinsmoor in 1831  He remained in the militia until 1847  and attained the rank of colonel before becoming a brigadier general in the Army during the MexicanAmerican War       Interested in revitalizing and reforming the state militias  which had become increasingly dormant during the years of peace following the War of 1812  Pierce worked with Alden Partridge   president of Norwich University   a military college in Vermont   and Truman B  Ransom and Alonzo Jackman   Norwich faculty members and militia officers  to increase recruiting efforts and improve training and readiness      Pierce served as a Norwich University trustee from 1841 to 1859  and received the honorary degree of LL D  from Norwich in 1853     In late 1832  the Democratic Party convention nominated Pierce for one of New Hampshire s five seats in the U S  House of Representatives   This was tantamount to election for the young Democrat  as the National Republicans had faded as a political force  while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following  Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson s landslide re election that year     New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically  but from 1832 through the mid 1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North  boosting Pierce s political career    Pierce s term began in March 1833  but he would not be sworn in until Congress met in December  and his attention was elsewhere  He had recently become engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough  Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid 1833     On November 19  1834  Pierce married Jane Means Appleton  March 12  1806 December 2  1863   the daughter of Jesse Appleton   a Congregational minister and former president of Bowdoin College  and Elizabeth Means  The Appletons were prominent Whigs  in contrast with the Pierces  Democratic affiliation  Jane was shy  devoutly religious  and pro  temperance   encouraging Pierce to abstain from alcohol  She was somewhat gaunt  and constantly ill from tuberculosis and psychological ailments  She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington  D C   creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce s political ascent     Jane disliked Hillsborough as well  and in 1838  the Pierces relocated to the state capital  Concord  New Hampshire     They had three sons  all of whom died in childhood  Franklin  Jr   February 25  1836  died in infancy  while Frank Robert  August 27  1839  November 14  1843  died at the age of four from epidemic typhus   Benjamin  April 13  1841  January 6  1853  died at the age of 11 in a train accident      Pierce departed in November 1833 for Washington  D C   where the Twenty third United States Congress convened its regular session on December 2  Jackson s second term was under way  and the House had a strong Democratic majority  whose primary focus was to prevent the Second Bank of the United States from being rechartered  The Democrats  including Pierce  defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party  and the bank s charter expired  Pierce broke from his party on occasion  opposing Democratic bills to fund internal improvements with federal money  He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional  with internal improvements the responsibility of the states  Pierce s first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint  and he was easily re elected in March 1835  When not in Washington  he attended to his law practice  and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the Twenty fourth Congress      As abolitionism grew more vocal in the mid 1830s  Congress was inundated with petitions from anti slavery groups seeking legislative action to restrict slavery in the United States  From the beginning  Pierce found the abolitionists   agitation  to be an annoyance  and saw federal action against slavery as an infringement on southern states  rights  even though he was morally opposed to slavery itself    He was also frustrated with the  religious bigotry  of abolitionists  who cast their political opponents as sinners     I consider slavery a social and political evil   Pierce said   and most sincerely wish that it had no existence upon the face of the earth     Still  he wrote in December 1835   One thing must be perfectly apparent to every intelligent man  This abolition movement must be crushed or there is an end to the Union      When Rep  James Henry Hammond of South Carolina looked to prevent anti slavery petitions from reaching the House floor  however  Pierce sided with the abolitionists  right to petition  Nevertheless  Pierce supported what came to be known as the gag rule   which allowed for petitions to be received  but not read or considered  This passed the House in 1836    He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti slavery Herald of Freedom as a   doughface    which had the dual meaning of  craven spirited man  and  northerner with southern sympathies     Pierce had stated that not one in five hundred New Hampshirites were abolitionists  the article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state and divided by the census figure  He was outraged when South Carolina Senator John C  Calhoun read the article on the Senate floor  After Pierce gave a speech indicating that most signatories were women and children  without the vote  Calhoun apologized     The resignation in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill  who had been elected governor of New Hampshire  left a brief interim opening to be filled by the state legislature  With Hill s term as senator due to expire in March 1837  the legislature also had to fill the six year term to follow  Pierce s candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P  Hale  a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin  After much debate  the legislature chose John Page to fill the rest of Hill s term  In December 1836  Pierce was elected to the full term  to commence in March 1837  becoming at age 32 one of the youngest member in Senate history to that point  The election came at a difficult time for Pierce  as his father  sister  and brother were all seriously ill  while Jane continued to suffer from chronic poor health  As senator  he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne  who often struggled financially  procuring a sinecure as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing     Pierce voted the party line on most issues  He was an able senator  but not an eminent one  he was overshadowed by the Great Triumvirate of Calhoun  Henry Clay   and Daniel Webster   who dominated the Senate    Pierce entered the Senate at a time of economic crisis  as the Panic of 1837 had begun  He considered the depression a result of the banking system s rapid growth  amidst  the extravagance of overtrading and the wilderness of speculation   So that federal money would not support speculative bank loans  he supported newly elected Democratic president Martin Van Buren and his plan to create an independent treasury   a proposal which split the Democratic Party  Debate over slavery continued in Congress  and abolitionists proposed its end in the District of Columbia  where Congress had jurisdiction  Pierce supported a resolution by Calhoun against this proposal  which Pierce considered a dangerous stepping stone to nationwide emancipation    Meanwhile  the Whigs were growing in congressional strength  which would leave Pierce s party with only a small majority by the end of the decade     One topic of particular importance to Pierce was the military  He challenged a bill which would expand the ranks of the Army s staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts in the rest of the country  He took an interest in military pensions  seeing abundant fraud within the system  and was named chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Pensions in the Twenty sixth Congress  18391841   In that capacity  he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army  with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications  which he considered outdated     Pierce campaigned vigorously throughout his home state for Van Buren s re election in the 1840 presidential election   The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to William Henry Harrison   the military hero  whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the Twenty seventh Congress   Harrison died after a month in office  and Vice President John Tyler succeeded him  Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration  questioning the removal of federal officeholders  and opposing Whig plans for a national bank  In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress  something he had been planning for some time    New Hampshire Democrats felt that no one should hold one of the state s Senate seats for longer than one six year term  Thus  he had little likelihood of re election  Also  he was frustrated at being a member of the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice    His last acts in the Senate before resigning in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states  believing that the money should go to the military instead  and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the New York Customs House   where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings     Despite his resignation from the Senate  Pierce had no intention of leaving public life  The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases  and allowed Jane a more robust community life    Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce s Senate term  and this separation had taken a toll on the family  Pierce  meanwhile  had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses    Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842  and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish  Known for his gracious personality  eloquence  and excellent memory  Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court  He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation     Pierce remained involved in the state Democratic Party  which was split by several issues  Governor Hill  who represented the commercial  urban wing of the party  advocated the use of government charters to support corporations  granting them privileges such as limited liability and eminent domain for building railroads  The radical   locofoco   wing of his party represented farmers and other rural voters  who sought an expansion of social programs and labor regulations and a restriction on corporate privilege  The state s political culture grew less tolerant of banks and corporations in the wake of the Panic of 1837  and Hill was voted out of office  Pierce was closer to the radicals philosophically  and reluctantly served as attorney against Hill in a dispute regarding ownership of a newspaperHill lost  and founded his own  in which Pierce was a frequent target     In June 1842 Pierce was named chairman of the State Democratic Committee  In the following year s state election he helped the radical wing take over the state legislature  The party remained divided on several issues  including railroad development and the temperance movement  and Pierce took a leading role in helping the state legislature settle their differences  His priorities were  order  moderation  compromise  and party unity   which he tried to place ahead of his personal views on political issues    As he would as president  Pierce valued Democratic Party unity highly  and saw opposition to slavery as a threat to that     The surprise victory of dark horse Democratic candidate James K  Polk in the 1844 presidential election was welcome news to Pierce  who had befriended the former Speaker of the House while both served in Congress  Pierce had campaigned heavily for Polk during the election  and in turn Polk appointed him United States Attorney for New Hampshire     Polk s most prominent cause was the annexation of Texas   an issue which caused a dramatic split between Pierce and his former ally Hale  now a U S  Representative  Hale was so impassioned against adding a new slave state that he wrote a letter to 1 400 Democrats in New Hampshire outlining his opposition to the measure  Pierce responded by re assembling the state Democratic convention to revoke Hale s nomination for another term in Congress  The political firestorm led to Pierce cutting off ties with his longtime friend  and with his law partner Fowler  who was a Hale supporter    Hale refused to withdraw  and as a majority vote was needed for election in New Hampshire  the party split led to deadlock and a vacant House seat  Eventually  the Whigs and Hale s Independent Democrats took control of the legislature  elected Whig Anthony Colby as governor and sent Hale to the Senate  much to Pierce s anger     Active military service was a long held dream for Pierce  who had admired his father s and brothers  service in his youth  particularly his older brother Benjamin  s  as well as that of John McNeil Jr    husband of Pierce s older half sister Elizabeth  As a legislator  he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias  As a militia officer himself  he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops  When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846  Pierce immediately volunteered to join  although no New England regiment yet existed  His hope to fight in the war was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk s Attorney General   General Zachary Taylor  s advance slowed in northern Mexico  and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City  Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments  and Pierce was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847  with Truman B  Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second in command     On March 3  1847  Pierce was promoted to brigadier general   and took command of a brigade of reinforcements for General Scott s army  with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment  Needing time to assemble his brigade  Pierce reached the already seized port of Vera Cruz in late June  where he prepared a march of 2 500 men accompanying supplies to take to Scott  The three week journey inland was perilous  and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott s army in early August  in time for the Battle of Contreras     The battle was disastrous for Pierce  his horse was suddenly startled during a charge  knocking him groin first against his saddle  The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell  pinning Pierce underneath and leaving him with a debilitating knee injury    The incident made it look like he had fainted  causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command   General Pierce is a damned coward     Pierce returned for the following day s action  but again injured his knee  forcing him to hobble after his men  and by the time he caught up  the battle had mostly been won     As the Battle of Churubusco approached  Pierce was ordered by Scott to the rear  He responded   For God s sake  General  this is the last great battle  and I must lead my brigade   Scott yielded  and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle  but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field  The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped negotiate an armistice  He then returned to command and led his brigade throughout the rest of the campaign  eventually taking part in the capture of Mexico City in mid September  although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle    He spent much of that battle in the sick tent  plagued with acute diarrhea    Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three month occupation of the city  while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations  and tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals     Pierce was finally allowed to return to Concord in late December 1847  He was given a hero s welcome in his home state and issued his resignation from the Army  which was approved on March 20  1848  His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire  but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long follow him  He had demonstrated competence as a general  especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz  but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander     Ulysses S  Grant   who had the opportunity to observe Pierce firsthand during the war  countered the allegations of cowardice in his memoirs  written several years after Pierce s death   Whatever General Pierce s qualifications may have been for the Presidency  he was a gentleman and a man of courage  I was not a supporter of him politically  but I knew him more intimately than I did any other of the volunteer generals      Returning to Concord  Pierce resumed his law work  in one notable case he defended the religious liberty of the Shakers   the insular sect who were being threatened with legal action over accusations of abuse  His role as a party leader  however  continued to take up most of his attention  He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale  who was stridently anti slavery and had opposed the war  stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation     The large Mexican Cession of land had divided the United States politically  with many in the North insisting that slavery not be allowed there  and offering the Wilmot Proviso to ensure it   while others wanted slavery barred north of the Missouri Compromise line of 3630  N   Both proposals were anathema to Southerners  and the controversy divided the Democrats  At the 1848 Democratic National Convention   the majority nominated former Michigan senator Lewis Cass for president  while a minority broke off to become the Free Soil Party   backing former president Van Buren  The Whigs chose General Taylor  a Louisianan  whose views on most political issues were unknown  Despite his past support for Van Buren  Pierce supported Cass  turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil ticket   and was so effective that Taylor  who was elected president   was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state     Senator Henry Clay  a Whig  hoped to put the slavery question to rest with what became known as the Compromise of 1850   which would give some victories to both slaveholders and abolitionists  and gained the support of his fellow Whig  Webster  With the proposal stalled in the Senate  Illinois Senator Stephen A  Douglas led an effort to split it into separate bills so that each legislator could vote against the parts his state opposed without endangering the overall package  This was done  and the bills passed  to be signed by President Millard Fillmore  who had succeeded Taylor after the president s death earlier in 1850     Pierce strongly supported the compromise  giving a well received speech in December 1850 pledging himself to  The Union  Eternal Union     The same month  the Democratic candidate for governor  John Atwood  issued a letter opposing the Compromise  and Pierce helped to recall the state convention and remove Atwood from the ticket    The fiasco would compromise the election for the Democrats  who lost several races  Still  Pierce s party retained its control over the state  and was well positioned for the upcoming presidential election     As the 1852 presidential election approached  the Democrats were divided by the slavery issue  though most of the  Barnburners  who had left the party with Van Buren to form the Free Soil Party had returned  It was widely expected that the 1852 Democratic National Convention would result in deadlock  with no major candidate able to win the necessary two thirds majority  New Hampshire Democrats  including Pierce  supported his old teacher  Levi Woodbury  by then an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court   as a compromise candidate  but Woodbury s death in September 1851 opened up an opportunity for Pierce s allies to present him as a potential dark horse in the mold of Polk  New Hampshire Democrats felt that  as the state in which their party had most consistently gained majorities  they should supply the presidential candidate  Other possible standard bearers included Douglas  Cass  William Marcy of New York  James Buchanan of Pennsylvania  Sam Houston of Texas  and Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri     Despite the backing of his home state  Pierce faced obstacles in gaining the nomination  as he had not held elective office in a decade  and lacked the front runners  national reputation  He publicly declared that such a nomination would be  utterly repugnant to my tastes and wishes   but given the desire of New Hampshire Democrats to see one of their own elected  knew that his position as a party leader would be endangered if he was unwilling to run    Thus  he quietly allowed his supporters to lobby for him  with the understanding that his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front runners could win  To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached  he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850  including the controversial Fugitive Slave Act      The convention assembled on June 1 in Baltimore   Maryland  and the deadlock occurred as expected  The first ballot was taken on June 3  Of 288 delegates  Cass claimed 116  Buchanan 93  and the rest were scattered  without a single vote for Pierce  The next 34 ballots passed with no one near victory  and still no votes for Pierce  The Buchanan team decided to have their delegates vote for minor candidates  including Pierce  to demonstrate that no one but Buchanan could win  It was hoped that once delegates realized this  the convention would unite behind Buchanan  This novel tactic backfired after several ballots as Virginia  New Hampshire  and Maine switched to Pierce  the remaining Buchanan forces began to break for Marcy  and before long Pierce was in third place  After the 48th ballot  North Carolina Congressman James C  Dobbin delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce  sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate  On the 49th ballot  Pierce received all but six of the votes  and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president  Delegates selected Alabama Senator William R  King   a Buchanan supporter  as Pierce s running mate   and adopted a party platform that rejected further  agitation  over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850     When word reached New Hampshire of the result  Pierce found it difficult to believe  and his wife fainted  Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin s candidacy would not be successful  as he knew she would not like to live in Washington     The Whig candidate was General Scott  whom Pierce had served under in Mexico  his running mate was Secretary of the Navy William A  Graham   The Whigs could not unify their factions as the Democrats had  and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats  including support of the Compromise of 1850  This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate  Senator Hale of New Hampshire  at the expense of the Whigs  The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen voter turnout in the election to its lowest level since 1836   it was  according to Pierce biographer Peter A  Wallner   one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history     Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti slavery northern Whigs for the candidate and platform  New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform   we defy it  execrate it  spit upon it      Pierce kept quiet so as not to upset his party s delicate unity  and allowed his allies to run the campaign  It was the custom at the time for candidates to not appear to seek the office  and he did no personal campaigning    Pierce s opponents caricatured him as a coward and alcoholic   the hero of many a well fought bottle    who was an anti Catholic    Scott  meanwhile  drew weak support from the Whigs  who were torn by their pro Compromise platform and found him to be an abysmal  gaffe prone public speaker    The Democrats were confident  a popular slogan was that the Democrats  will pierce their enemies in 1852 as they poked  that is  Polked   them in 1844     This proved to be true  as Scott won only Kentucky  Tennessee  Massachusetts and Vermont  finishing with 42 electoral votes to Pierce s 254  With 3 2 million votes cast  Pierce won the popular vote with 50 9 to 44 1 percent  A sizable block of Free Soilers broke for Pierce s in state rival  Hale  who won 4 9 percent of the popular vote    The Democrats took large majorities in Congress     Pierce began his presidency in mourning  Weeks after his election  on January 6  1853  the President elect s family had been traveling from Boston by train when their car derailed and rolled down an embankment near Andover  Massachusetts   Pierce and Jane survived  but in the wreckage found their only remaining son  11 year old Benjamin  crushed to death  his body nearly decapitated  Pierce was not able to hide the gruesome sight from Jane  They both suffered severe depression afterward  which likely affected Pierce s performance as president    Jane wondered if the train accident was divine punishment for her husband s pursuit and acceptance of high office  She wrote a lengthy letter of apology to  Benny  for her failings as a mother    Jane would avoid social functions for much of her first two years as First Lady   making her public debut in that role to great sympathy at the public reception held at the White House on New Year s Day  1855     Jane remained in New Hampshire as Pierce departed for his inauguration  which she did not attend  Pierce  the youngest man to be elected president to that point  chose to affirm his oath of office on a law book rather than swear it on a Bible  as all his predecessors except John Quincy Adams had done  He was the first president to deliver his inaugural address from memory  In the address he hailed an era of peace and prosperity at home and urged a vigorous assertion of U S  interests in its foreign relations  including the  eminently important  acquisition of new territories   The policy of my Administration   said the new president   will not be deterred by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion   Avoiding the word  slavery   he emphasized his desire to put the  important subject  to rest and maintain a peaceful union  He alluded to his own personal tragedy  telling the crowd   You have summoned me in my weakness  you must sustain me by your strength      In his Cabinet appointments  Pierce sought to unite a party that was squabbling over the fruits of victory  Most of the party had not originally supported him for the nomination  and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections  Pierce decided to allow each of the party s factions some appointments  even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850     All of Pierce s cabinet nominations were confirmed unanimously and immediately by the Senate    Pierce spent the first few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower level federal positions to be filled  This was a chore  as he sought to represent all factions of the party  and could fully satisfy none of them  Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends  which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions  Before long  northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro slavery secessionists  while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism     Factionalism between the pro  and anti administration Democrats ramped up quickly  especially within the New York Democratic Party  The more conservative Hardshell Democrats or  Hards  of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration  which was associated with Marcy  who became Secretary of State  and the more moderate New York faction  the Softshell Democrats or  Softs      Buchanan had urged Pierce to consult Vice President elect King in selecting the Cabinet  but Pierce did not do soPierce and King never communicated once they had been selected as candidates in June 1852  By the start of 1853  King was severely ill with tuberculosis  and went to Cuba to recuperate  His condition deteriorated  and Congress passed a special law  allowing him to be sworn in before the American consul in Havana on March 24  Wanting to die at home  he returned to his plantation in Alabama on April 17 and died the next day  The office of vice president remained vacant for the remainder of Pierce s term  as the Constitution had no provision for filling the vacancy  making Senate President pro tempore David Atchison of Missouri next in line to the presidency     Pierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors    His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later    The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland   who systematized its operations  expanded the use of paper records  and pursued fraud    Another of Pierce s reforms was to expand the role of the U S  attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys  which was an important step in the eventual development of the Justice Department     There was a vacancy on the Supreme CourtFillmore  having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees  had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator Judah P  Benjamin   who had declined  Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin  and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal    nominated instead John Archibald Campbell   an advocate of states  rights  this would be Pierce s only Supreme Court appointment     Pierce charged Treasury Secretary James Guthrie with reforming the Treasury   which was inefficiently managed  with many unsettled accounts  Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors  many of whom were withholding money from the government  Despite laws requiring funds to be held in the Treasury  large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations  Guthrie reclaimed these funds  and sought to prosecute corrupt officials  with mixed success     Secretary of War Jefferson Davis   at Pierce s request  led surveys with the Corps of Topographical Engineers of possible transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country  The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements  but Davis felt that such a project could be justified as a Constitutional national security objective  Davis also deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to supervise construction projects in the District of Columbia  including the expansion of the United States Capitol and building of the Washington Monument      The Pierce administration fell in line with the expansionist Young America movement  with William L  Marcy leading the charge as Secretary of State   Marcy sought to present to the world a distinctively American  republican image  He issued a circular recommending that U S  diplomats wear  the simple dress of an American citizen  instead of the elaborate diplomatic uniforms worn in the courts of Europe  and that they only hire American citizens to work in consulates    Marcy received international praise for his 73 page letter defending Austrian refugee Martin Koszta   who had been captured abroad in mid 1853 by the Austrian government despite his intention to become a U S  citizen     Davis  an advocate of a southern transcontinental route  persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad  Gadsden was also charged with re negotiating the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which required the U S  to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory  Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna in December 1853  purchasing a large swath of land to America s southwest  Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker  s unauthorized expedition into Mexico  and so a clause was included charging the U S  with combating future such attempts    Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico  the price was cut from  15million to  10million  Congress also included a protection clause for a private citizen  Albert G  Sloo  whose interests were threatened by the purchase  Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse the final version of the treaty  which was ratified nonetheless    The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present day boundaries  excepting later minor adjustments     Relations with the United Kingdom were tense  as American fishermen felt menaced by the British navy s increasing enforcement of Canadian waters  Marcy completed a trade reciprocity agreement with British minister to Washington  John Crampton   which would reduce the need for aggressive coastline enforcement  Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government  which was slow to support a new treaty  A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854  which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada    While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canadian border  U S  interests were also threatened in Central America  where the ClaytonBulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence  Gaining the advantage over Britain in the region was a key part of Pierce s expansionist goals     British consuls in the United States sought to enlist Americans for the Crimean War in 1854  in violation of neutrality laws  and Pierce eventually expelled minister Crampton and three consuls  To the President s surprise  the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation  In his December 1855 message to Congress Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton Bulwer Treaty  The British  according to Buchanan  were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy  Nevertheless  Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions  The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress  the British Parliament  and by the colonial legislatures in Canada     Pierce s administration aroused sectional apprehensions when three U S  diplomats in Europe drafted a proposal to the president to purchase Cuba from Spain for  120million  USD   and justify the  wresting  of it from Spain if the offer were refused  The publication of the Ostend Manifesto   which had been drawn up at the insistence of Secretary of State Marcy  provoked the scorn of northerners who viewed it as an attempt to annex a slave holding possession to bolster Southern interests  It helped discredit the expansionist policy of Manifest Destiny the Democratic Party had often supported     Pierce favored expansion and a substantial reorganization of the military  Secretary of War Davis and Navy Secretary James C  Dobbin found the Army and Navy in poor condition  with insufficient forces  a reluctance to adopt new technology  and inefficient management    Under the Pierce administration  Commodore Matthew C  Perry visited Japan  a venture originally planned under Fillmore  in an effort to expand trade to the East  Perry wanted to encroach on Asia by force  but Pierce and Dobbin pushed him to remain diplomatic  Perry signed a modest trade treaty with the Japanese shogunate which was successfully ratified    The 1856 launch of the USS Merrimac   one of six newly commissioned steam frigates   was one of Pierce s  most personally satisfying  days in office     The greatest challenge to the country s equilibrium during the Pierce administration was the passage of the KansasNebraska Act   Organizing the largely unsettled Nebraska Territory   which stretched from Missouri to the Rocky Mountains   and from Texas north to what is now the Canadian border  was a crucial part of Douglas s plans for western expansion  He wanted a transcontinental railroad with a link from Chicago to California  through the vast western territory  Organizing the territory was necessary for settlement as the land would not be surveyed nor put up for sale until a territorial government was authorized  Those from slave states had never been content with western limits on slavery  and felt it should be able to expand into territories procured with blood and treasure that had come  in part  from the South  Douglas and his allies planned to organize the territory and let local settlers decide whether to allow slavery   This would repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820  as most of it was north of the 3630  N line the Missouri Compromise deemed  free   The territory would be split into a northern part  Nebraska  and a southern part  Kansas   and the expectation was that Kansas would allow slavery and Nebraska would not    In the view of the Southern states   the Compromise of 1850 had already annulled the Missouri Compromise by admitting the state of California   including territory south of the compromise line  as a free state     Pierce had wanted to organize the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery  but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this    Pierce was skeptical of the bill  knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North  Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless  It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P  Chase and Massachusetts  Charles Sumner   who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill  Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase  moves towards Cuba annexation  and the influence of slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis  and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression  The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce s presidency     Pierce and his administration used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board in favor of the bill  The Whigs split along sectional lines  the conflict destroyed them as a national party  The KansasNebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency  The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short term influence of the nativist and anti Catholic American Party  often called the Know Nothings   and the founding of the Republican Party      Even as the act was being debated  settlers on both sides of the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting  The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as Bleeding Kansas   Thousands of pro slavery Border Ruffians came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas  giving that element the victory  Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities  When Free Staters set up a shadow government  and drafted the Topeka Constitution   Pierce called their work an act of rebellion  The president continued to recognize the pro slavery legislature  which was dominated by Democrats  even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate  He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the Topeka government     Passage of the act coincided with the seizure of escaped slave Anthony Burns in Boston  Northerners rallied in support of Burns  but Pierce was determined to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter  and dispatched federal troops to enforce the return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds     The midterm congressional elections of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats  as well as to the Whig Party  which was on its last legs   The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South  The administration s opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress  though only a few northern Whigs gained election  In Pierce s New Hampshire  hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party  the Know Nothings elected the governor  all three representatives  dominated the legislature  and returned Hale to the Senate  Anti immigrant fervor brought the Know Nothings their highest numbers to that point  and some northerners were elected under the auspices of the new Republican Party     Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats  In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim  let alone re election  The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the KansasNebraska Act  and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce s electoral vulnerability  Nevertheless  his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Stephen A  Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination  Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce s term  leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle     When balloting began on June 5 at the convention in Cincinnati  Ohio   Pierce expected a plurality  if not the required two thirds majority  On the first ballot  he received only 122 votes  many of them from the South  to Buchanan s 135  with Douglas and Cass receiving the rest  By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed  but none of the three main candidates were able to get two thirds of the vote  Pierce  whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed  directed his supporters to break for Douglas  withdrawing his name in a last ditch effort to defeat Buchanan  Douglas  only 43 years of age  believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time  and received assurances from Buchanan s managers that this would be the case  After two more deadlocked ballots  Douglas s managers withdrew his name  leaving Buchanan as the clear winner  To soften the blow to Pierce  the convention issued a resolution of  unqualified approbation  in praise of his administration and selected his ally  Kentucky Representative John C  Breckinridge   as the vice presidential nominee     Pierce endorsed Buchanan  though the two remained distant  he hoped to resolve the Kansas situation by November to improve the Democrats  chances in the general election  He installed John W  Geary as territorial governor  who drew the ire of pro slavery legislators    Geary was able to restore order in Kansas  though the electoral damage had already been doneRepublicans used  Bleeding Kansas  and  Bleeding Sumner   the brutal caning of Charles Sumner by South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks in the Senate chamber  as election slogans    The Buchanan Breckinridge ticket was elected  but the Democratic percentage of the popular vote in the North fell from 49 8 percent in 1852 to 41 4 in 1856 as Buchanan won only five of sixteen free states  Pierce had won fourteen   and in three of those  Buchanan won because of a split between the Republican candidate  former California senator John C  Frmont and the Know Nothing  former president Fillmore     Pierce did not temper his rhetoric after losing the nomination  In his final message to Congress  delivered in December 1856  he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists  He took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy  and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations    In the final days of the Pierce administration  Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels  also expanding the number of seamen enlisted  It also passed a tariff reduction bill he had long sought    Pierce and his cabinet left office on March 4  1857  the only time in U S  history that the original cabinet members all remained for a full four year term     After leaving the White House  the Pierces remained in Washington for more than two months  staying with former Secretary of State Marcy    Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration  replacing all of his appointees  The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth  New Hampshire  where Pierce had begun to speculate in property  Seeking warmer weather  he and Jane spent the next three years traveling  beginning with a stay in Madeira and followed by tours of Europe and the Bahamas     In Rome  he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne  the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever     Pierce never lost sight of politics during his travels  commenting regularly on the nation s growing sectarian conflict  He insisted that northern abolitionists stand down to avoid a southern secession  writing that the bloodshed of a civil war would  not be along Mason and Dixon s line merely   but  within our own borders in our own streets     He also criticized New England Protestant ministers  who largely supported abolition and Republican candidates  for their  heresy and treason     The rise of the Republican Party forced the Democrats to defend Pierce  during his debates with Republican Senate candidate Abraham Lincoln in 1858  Douglas called the former president  a man of integrity and honor      As the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached  some asked Pierce to run as a compromise candidate that could unite the fractured party  but Pierce refused  As Douglas struggled to attract southern support  Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives  but his priority was a united Democratic Party  The split Democrats were soundly defeated for the presidency by the Republican candidate  Lincoln  In the months between Lincoln s election  and his inauguration on March 4  1861  Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede  He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state s secession convention  Due to illness he declined  but sent a letter appealing to the people of Alabama to remain in the Union  and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground     After efforts to prevent the Civil War ended with the firing on Fort Sumter   Northern Democrats  including Douglas  endorsed Lincoln s plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force  Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs  and wrote to Van Buren  proposing an assembly of former U S  presidents to resolve the issue  but this suggestion was not acted on   I will never justify  sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel  heartless  aimless  unnecessary war   Pierce wrote to his wife    Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln s order suspending the writ of habeas corpus   arguing that even in a time of war  the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties  This stand won him admirers with the emerging Northern Peace Democrats   but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce s southern bias     In September 1861  Pierce traveled to Michigan  visiting his former Interior Secretary  McClelland  former senator Cass  and others  A Detroit bookseller  J  A  Roys  sent a letter to Lincoln s Secretary of State  William H  Seward   accusing the former president of meeting with disloyal people  and saying he had heard there was a plot to overthrow the government and establish Pierce as president  Later that month  the pro administration Detroit Tribune printed an item calling Pierce  a prowling traitor spy   and intimating that he was a member of the pro Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle   No such conspiracy existed  but a Pierce supporter  Guy S  Hopkins  sent to the Tribune a letter purporting to be from a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle  indicating that  President P   was part of a plot against the Union    Hopkins intended for the Tribune to make the charges public  at which point Hopkins would admit authorship  thus making the Tribune editors seem overly partisan and gullible  Instead  the Tribune editors forwarded the Hopkins letter to government officials  Seward then ordered the arrest of possible  traitors  in Michigan  which included Hopkins  Hopkins confessed authorship of the letter and admitted the hoax  but despite this  Seward wrote to Pierce demanding to know if the charges were true  Pierce denied them  and Seward hastily backtracked  Later  Republican newspapers printed the Hopkins letter in spite of his admission that it was a hoax  and Pierce decided that he needed to clear his name publicly  When Seward refused to make their correspondence public  Pierce publicized his outrage by having a Senate ally  California s Milton Latham   read the letters between Seward and Pierce into the Congressional record  to the administration s embarrassment     The institution of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti administration Democrat Clement Vallandigham further incensed Pierce  who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln   Who  I ask  has clothed the President with power to dictate to any one of us when we must or when we may speak  or be silent upon any subject  and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant    he demanded    Pierce s comments were ill received in much of the North  especially as his criticism of Lincoln s aims coincided with the twin Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg   Pierce s reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president  Jefferson Davis  was seized by Union soldiers  Pierce s correspondence with Davis  all pre war  revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North  was sent to the press  Pierce s words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him     Jane Pierce died of tuberculosis in Andover  Massachusetts in December 1863  she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord  New Hampshire  Pierce was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne s death in May 1864  he was with Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly  Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce  Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce s name up for consideration as the 1864 election unfolded  but he kept his distance  Lincoln easily won a second term  When news spread of Lincoln s assassination in April 1865  a mob gathered outside Pierce s home in Concord  demanding to know why he had not raised a flag to show his grief  Pierce grew angry  expressing sadness over Lincoln s death but denying any need for a public gesture  He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism  which was enough to quiet the crowd     Pierce s drinking worsened his health in his last years  and he grew increasingly spiritual  He had a brief relationship with an unknown woman in mid 1865  During this time  he used his influence to improve the treatment of Davis  now a prisoner at Fortress Monroe in Virginia  He also offered financial help to Hawthorne s son Julian  as well as to his own nephews  On the second anniversary of Jane s death  Pierce was baptized into his wife s Episcopal faith at St  Paul s Church in Concord  He found this church to be less political than his former Congregational denomination  which had alienated Democrats with anti slavery rhetoric  He took up the life of an  old farmer   as he called himself  buying up property and farming it himself  while entertaining visiting relatives    He spent most of his time in Concord and his cottage at Little Boar s Head on the coast  sometimes visiting Jane s relatives in Massachusetts  Still interested in politics  he expressed support for Andrew Johnson  s Reconstruction policy and supported the president s acquittal in his impeachment trial   he later expressed optimism for Johnson s successor  Ulysses S  Grant     Pierce s health declined further through mid 1869  although he continued to drink  He returned to Concord that September  suffering from severe cirrhosis of the liver  knowing he would not recover  A caretaker was hired for him  none of his family members were present in his final days  He died at 4 35am on October 8  President Grant  who later defended Pierce s service in the Mexican War  declared a day of national mourning  Newspapers across the country carried lengthy front page stories examining Pierce s colorful and controversial career  Pierce was interred next to his wife and two of his sons in the Minot enclosure at Concord s Old North Cemetery      In his last will   which he signed January 22  1868  Pierce left a large number of specific bequests such as paintings  swords  horses  and other items to friends  family  and neighbors  Much of his  72 000 estate  about  1 2 million in 2014  went to his brother Henry s family  and to Hawthorne s children and Pierce s landlady  Henry s son Frank Pierce received the largest share     In addition to his LL D  from Norwich University  Pierce also received honorary doctorates from Bowdoin College  1853  and Dartmouth College  1860      Two places in New Hampshire have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places specifically because of their association with Pierce  The Franklin Pierce Homestead in Hillsborough is a state park and a National Historic Landmark   open to the public    The Franklin Pierce House in Concord  where Pierce died  was destroyed by fire in 1981  but is nevertheless listed on the register    The Pierce Manse   his Concord home from 1842 to 1848  is open seasonally and maintained by a volunteer group   The Pierce Brigade      Several institutions and places have been named after Pierce  mostly in New Hampshire  The Franklin Pierce University in Rindge  New Hampshire   was chartered in 1962    The University of New Hampshire School of Law was founded in 1973 as the Franklin Pierce Law Center  When the school was renamed in 2010  a Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property was established    There is a Mt  Pierce in the Presidential Range of New Hampshire s White Mountains   renamed from Mt  Clinton in 1913    The small town of Pierceton  Indiana   was founded in the 1850s and honors President Pierce     After Pierce died  he mostly passed from the American consciousness  except as one of a series of presidents whose disastrous tenures led to civil war    Pierce s presidency is widely regarded as a failure  he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history     a   The public placed him third to last among his peers in C SPAN surveys  2000 and 2009     Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative  most disastrously with the KansasNebraska Act  Although he did not lead that fightSenator Douglas didPierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation    The failure of Pierce  as president  to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson  and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics     Historian Eric Foner says   His administration turned out to be one of the most disastrous in American history  It witnessed the collapse of the party system inherited from the Age of Jackson     Biographer Roy Nichols argues   Despite a reputation as an able politician and a likable man  during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war    To Pierce  who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality    the Union was sacred  because of this  he saw the actions of abolitionists  and the more moderate Free Soilers  as divisive and as a threat to the constitutionally guaranteed rights of southerners    Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery  he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests     David Potter concludes that the Ostend Manifesto and the KansasNebraska Act were  the two great calamities of the Franklin Pierce administration    Both brought down an avalanche of public criticism     More important  says Potter  they permanently discredited Manifest Destiny and  popular sovereignty  as political doctrines    Historian Kenneth Nivison  writing in 2010  takes a more favorable view of Pierce s foreign policy  stating that his expansionism prefaced those of later presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt   who served at a time when America had the military might to make her desires stick   American foreign and commercial policy beginning in the 1890s  which eventually supplanted European colonialism by the middle of the twentieth century  owed much to the paternalism of Jacksonian Democracy cultivated in the international arena by the Presidency of Franklin Pierce      Historian Larry Gara  who authored a book on Pierce s presidency  wrote in the former president s entry in American National Biography Online    He was president at a time that called for almost superhuman skills  yet he lacked such skills and never grew into the job to which he had been elected  His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past  He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North  He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada  to begin the opening of Japan to western trade  to add land to the Southwest  and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire  the Guano Islands Act    His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife  His support for the Kansas Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections  Pierce was hard working and his administration largely untainted by graft  yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war    ", "Eisenhower": "Awards and decorations Early life and education Personal life Early military career World War I In

of the United States from 1953 until 1961  and the last U S  President to have been born in the 19th century  He was a five star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe  He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 194243 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 194445 from the Western Front   In 1951  he became the first Supreme Commander of NATO      Eisenhower was of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry and was raised in a large family in Kansas by parents with a strong religious background  He graduated from West Point and later married and had two sons  After World War II  Eisenhower served as Army Chief of Staff under President Harry S  Truman and then accepted the post of President at Columbia University      Eisenhower entered the 1952 presidential race as a Republican to counter the non interventionism of Senator Robert A  Taft   campaigning against  communism  Korea and corruption   He won in a landslide  defeating Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson and temporarily upending the New Deal Coalition    Eisenhower s main goals in office were to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits  In the first year of his presidency  he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in order to conclude the Korean War   his New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces  In 1954  Eisenhower rejected the use of military force to help the French retain their colony of Vietnam  Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution   which obliged the U S  to militarily support the pro Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the ostracism of the People s Republic of China    After the Soviet Union launched the world s first artificial satellite in 1957  Eisenhower authorized the establishment of NASA   which led to the space race   During the Suez Crisis of 1956  Eisenhower condemned the Israeli  British and French invasion of Egypt  and forced them to withdraw  He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action  In 1958  Eisenhower sent 15 000 U S  troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro Western government from falling to a Nasser  inspired revolution  Near the end of his term  his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U 2 incident     In his January 17  1961 farewell address to the nation   Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of corporate control of Congress and massive military spending  particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers  and coined the term   military industrial complex       On the domestic front  he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege   He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President  Richard Nixon   He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security   He also launched the Interstate Highway System   the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA   the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act   and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act      As a part of his domestic policy  he sent federal troops to Little Rock  Arkansas   for the first time since Reconstruction to enforce federal court orders to desegregate public schools  He also signed civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 to protect the right to vote  He implemented desegregation of the armed forces in two years and made five appointments to the Supreme Court  He was the first term limited president in accordance with the 22nd Amendment   Eisenhower s two terms saw considerable economic prosperity except for a sharp recession in 195859  Voted Gallup s most admired man twelve times  he achieved widespread popular esteem both in and out of office    Since the late 20th century  consensus among Western scholars has consistently held Eisenhower as one of the greatest U S  Presidents     The Eisenhauer  German for  iron hewer miner   family migrated from Karlsbrunn   Germany   to North America  first settling in York  Pennsylvania   in 1741  and in the 1880s moving to Kansas     Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer was anglicized to Eisenhower    Eisenhower s Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors  who were primarily farmers  included Hans Nikolaus Eisenhauer of Karlsbrunn  who migrated to Lancaster  Pennsylvania   in 1741     Hans s great great grandson  David Jacob Eisenhower  18631942   was Dwight s father and was a college educated engineer  despite his own father Jacob s urging to stay on the family farm  Eisenhower s mother  Ida Elizabeth  Stover  Eisenhower   born in Virginia  of German Protestant ancestry  moved to Kansas from Virginia  She married David on September 23  1885  in Lecompton  Kansas   on the campus of their alma mater  Lane University      David owned a general store in Hope  Kansas   but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished  The Eisenhowers then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892  and later returned to Kansas  with  24 to their name at the time  David worked as a mechanic with a railroad and then with a creamery    By 1898  the parents made a decent living and provided a suitable home for their large family     Eisenhower was born on October 14  1890  in Denison  Texas   the third of seven boys    His mother originally named him David Dwight but reversed the two names after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family    All of the boys were called  Ike   such as  Big Ike   Edgar  and  Little Ike   Dwight   the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name    By World War II  only Dwight was still called  Ike      In 1892  the family moved to Abilene  Kansas   which Eisenhower considered his home town    As a child  he was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother an eye  he later referred to this as an experience teaching him the need to be protective of those under him  Dwight developed a keen and enduring interest in exploring outdoors  hunting fishing  cooking and card playing from an illiterate named Bob Davis who camped on the Smoky Hill River          While Eisenhower s mother was against war  it was her collection of history books that first sparked Eisenhower s early and lasting interest in military history  He persisted in reading the books in her collection and became a voracious reader in the subject  Other favorite subjects early in his education were arithmetic and spelling     His parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading  Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children  and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline  usually from David    His mother  previously a member  with David  of the River Brethren sect of the Mennonites   joined the International Bible Students Association   later known as Jehovah s Witnesses   The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915  though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students    His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother  who felt that warfare was  rather wicked   but she did not overrule him    While speaking of himself in 1948  Eisenhower said he was  one of the most deeply religious men I know  though unattached to any  sect or organization   He was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in 1953     Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909    As a freshman  he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin  and which his doctor diagnosed as life threatening  The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it  and miraculously recovered  though he had to repeat his freshman year    He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college  though they lacked the funds  They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions     Edgar took the first turn at school  and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery    Edgar asked for a second year  Dwight consented and worked for a second year  At that time  a friend  Swede  Hazlet was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school  since no tuition was required  Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U S  Senator  Joseph L  Bristow   Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance exam competition  he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy    He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911     At West Point  Eisenhower relished the emphasis on traditions and on sports  but was less enthusiastic about the hazing  though he willingly accepted it as a plebe  He was also a regular violator of the more detailed regulations  and finished school with a less than stellar discipline rating  Academically  Eisenhower s best subject by far was English  Otherwise  his performance was average  though he thoroughly enjoyed the typical emphasis of engineering on science and mathematics     In athletics  Eisenhower later said that  not making the baseball team at West Point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life  maybe my greatest     He did make the football team  and was a varsity starter as running back and linebacker in 1912  tackling the legendary Jim Thorpe of the Carlisle Indians that year    Eisenhower suffered a torn knee in that  his last  game  he re injured his knee on horseback and in the boxing ring        so he turned to fencing and gymnastics     Eisenhower later served as junior varsity football coach and cheerleader  At West Point he played football      He graduated in the middle of the class of 1915    which became known as   the class the stars fell on    because 59 members eventually became general officers    Eisenhower met and fell in love with Mamie Geneva Doud of Boone  Iowa   six years his junior  while he was stationed in Texas    He and her family were also immediately taken with one another  He proposed to her on Valentine s Day in 1916    A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the pending U S  entry into World War I  In their first 35 years of marriage  they moved many times     The Eisenhowers had two sons  Doud Dwight  Icky  Eisenhower was born September 24  1917  and died of scarlet fever on January 2  1921  at the age of three    Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death    Their second son  John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower   was born on August 3  1922  while they were in Panama  John served in the United States Army   retired as a brigadier general  became an author and served as U S  Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971  John  coincidentally  graduated from West Point on D Day  June 6  1944  He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10  1947  John and Barbara had four children  Dwight David II   Barbara Ann  Susan Elaine and Mary Jean   David  after whom Camp David is named    married Richard Nixon  s daughter Julie in 1968  John died on December 21  2013     Eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life  and joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948    He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game  to the point of golfing during winter  and ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground  He had a small  basic golf facility installed at Camp David   and became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts   inviting Roberts to stay at the White House on several occasions  Roberts  an investment broker  also handled the Eisenhower family s investments  Roberts also advised Eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs  which proved financially lucrative     After golf  oil painting was Eisenhower s second hobby    While at Columbia University  Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E  Stephens paint Mamie s portrait  Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax  mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie  their grandchildren  General Montgomery  George Washington   and Abraham Lincoln     Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower s work   simple and earnest  rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president   A conservative in both art and politics  he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as  a piece of canvas that looks like a broken down Tin Lizzie   loaded with paint  has been driven over it      Angels in the Outfield was Eisenhower s favorite movie    His favorite reading material for relaxation were the Western novels of Zane Grey     With his excellent memory and ability to focus  Eisenhower was skilled at card games  He learned poker  which he called his  favorite indoor sport   in Abilene  Eisenhower recorded West Point classmates  poker losses for payment after graduation  and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him  A classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at West Point  Eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months     After graduation in 1915  Lieutenant  2nd  Eisenhower put in for assignment in the Philippines  which was denied  He served with the infantry   initially in logistics  until 1918 at various camps in Texas and Georgia   In 1916  while stationed at Fort Sam Houston   Eisenhower was football coach for St  Louis College  now St  Mary s University     In late 1917 while in charge of training at Ft  Oglethorpe in Georgia  Mamie had their first son   When the U S  entered World War I he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft  Leavenworth  Kansas    In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers  His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps   where he was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel in the National Army     He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt  his first command at the site of  Pickett s Charge  on the Gettysburg  Pennsylvania Civil War battleground  Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat  he displayed excellent organizational skills  as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers  strengths and make optimal placements of personnel     Once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to France  This time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed  just a week before departure    Completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time  despite being given the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at home    citation needed   In World War II  rivals who had combat service in the first great war  led by Gen  Bernard Montgomery   sought to denigrate Eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty  despite his stateside experience establishing a camp  completely equipped  for thousands of troops  and developing a full combat training schedule     After the war  Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major   a rank he held for 16 years    The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads in the nation  Indeed  the convoy averaged only 5mph from Washington  D C   to San Francisco  later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as President     He assumed duties again at Camp Meade   Maryland   commanding a battalion of tanks  where he remained until 1922  His schooling continued  focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it  His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S  Patton   Sereno E  Brett   and other senior tank leaders  Their leading edge ideas of speed oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors  who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry  Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment  and he relented       From 1920  Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals Fox Conner   John J  Pershing   Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall   He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone   where  joined by Mamie  he served until 1924  Under Conner s tutelage  he studied military history and theory  including Carl von Clausewitz  s On War    and later cited Conner s enormous influence on his military thinking  saying in 1962 that  Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew   Conner s comment on Eisenhower was    He  is one of the most capable  efficient and loyal officers I have ever met     On Conner s recommendation  in 192526 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth   Kansas  where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers      He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning   Georgia   until 1927   During the late 1920s and early 1930s  Eisenhower s career in the post war army stalled somewhat  as military priorities diminished  many of his friends resigned for high paying business jobs  He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing  and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower   then a journalist at the Agriculture Department  he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe  He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928  After a one year assignment in France  Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V  Mosely  Assistant Secretary of War  from 1929 to February 1933     His primary duty was planning for the next war  which proved most difficult in the midst of the Great Depression     He then was posted as chief military aide to General MacArthur  Army Chief of Staff   In 1932  he participated in the clearing of the Bonus March encampment in Washington  D C  Although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised MacArthur against taking a public role in it  he later wrote the Army s official incident report  endorsing MacArthur s conduct       In 1935  he accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines   where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government in developing their army  Eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with his patron regarding the role of the Philippine Army and the leadership qualities that an American army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates  The dispute and resulting antipathy between Eisenhower and MacArthur lasted the rest of their lives     Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill   George S  Patton   George Marshall   and General Montgomery during World War II  Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with MacArthur  and that a positive relationship endured    While in Manila  Mamie suffered a life threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully  Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936  He also learned to fly  making a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilot s license in 1939 at Fort Lewis     Also around this time  he was offered a post by the Philippine Commonwealth Government  namely by then Philippine President Manuel L  Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur  to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned  now named Quezon City   but he declined the offer    citation needed    Eisenhower returned to the U S  in December 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis  Washington   In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce   In June 1941  he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger   Commander of the 3rd Army   at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio   Texas   After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers   he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3  1941      Although his administrative abilities had been noticed  on the eve of the U S  entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations   After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor   Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington  where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany   He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division  WPD   General Leonard T  Gerow   and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division  Next  he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division  which replaced WPD  under Chief of Staff General George C  Marshall  who spotted talent and promoted accordingly     At the end of May 1942  Eisenhower accompanied Lt  Gen  Henry H  Arnold   commanding general of the Army Air Forces   to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England  Maj  Gen  James E  Chaney  He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment  stating he had an  uneasy feeling  about Chaney and his staff  On June 23  1942  he returned to London as Commanding General  European Theater of Operations  ETOUSA   based in London and with a house on Coombe  Kingston upon Thames     and replaced Chaney    He was promoted to lieutenant general on July 7   In November 1942  he was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations  NATOUSA  through the new operational Headquarters A E FHQ   The word  expeditionary  was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons    citation needed   The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned underground within the Rock of Gibraltar   Eisenhower was the first non British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years     French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign  and Eisenhower encountered a  preposterous situation  with the multiple rival factions in France  His primary objective was to move forces successfully onto Tunisia  and intending to facilitate that objective  he gave his support to Franois Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa  despite Darlan s previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as Commander in Chief of French armed forces  The Allied leaders were  thunderstruck  by this from a political standpoint  though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation  Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move  Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle   Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies  considering it a criminal rather than a military matter    Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner  who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan s commander in chief  and who had refused to postpone the execution     Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower s combat command skills  during the initial phase of Erwin Rommel  s move into the Kasserine Pass   Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates  He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall   He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns    In February 1943  his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British Eighth Army   commanded by General Bernard Law Montgomery   The Eighth Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign   Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA   After the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa  Eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of Sicily   Once Mussolini had fallen in Italy  the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche   But while Eisenhower argued with Roosevelt and Churchill  who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians  the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country making the job more difficult  by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1  nevertheless  the invasion of Italy was highly successful     In December 1943  President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower not Marshall would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe  The following month  he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force  SHAEF   serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945    He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord   the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany   Eisenhower  as well as the officers and troops under him  had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations  and their skill sets had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germansa beach landing assault  His first struggles  however  were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion  he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with de Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord    Admiral Ernest J  King fought with Eisenhower over King s refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific    He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord  to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented  as he did    Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter s concern with civilian casualties  de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans  and Eisenhower prevailed    He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S  Patton   by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate   and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy     The D Day Normandy landings on June 6  1944  were costly but successful  A month later  the invasion of Southern France took place  and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF  Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer s endhowever the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year  From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8  1945  Eisenhower  through SHAEF  commanded all Allied forces  and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U S  forces on the Western Front north of the Alps   He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families  This prompted him to make a point of personally visiting every division involved in the invasion    Eisenhower s sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed  It has been called one of the great speeches of history   Our landings in the Cherbourg Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops  My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available  The troops  the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do  If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt  it is mine alone     Once the coastal assault had succeeded  Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy  and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany  Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group  s attack being made in the north  while Generals Bradley   12th U S  Army Group   and Devers   Sixth U S  Army Group   insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front  respectively   Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces  often by giving them tactical  though sometimes ineffective  latitude  many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe  However  due to Eisenhower s persistence  the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully  albeit belatedly  opened in late 1944   and victory became a more distinct probability     In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command  on December 20  1944  he was promoted to General of the Army   equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies  In this and the previous high commands he held  Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy  Although he had never seen action himself  he won the respect of front line commanders  He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill   Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle   He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy  but these rarely upset his relationships with them  He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov   his Russian counterpart  and they became good friends     The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive  in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944  which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage    German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies  The British wanted Berlin  but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin  and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit  The British backed down  but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons  Washington refused to support Churchill s plan to use Eisenhower s army for political maneuvers against Moscow  The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt  Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon  The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large scale bloody battle   and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7  1945     Following the German unconditional surrender  Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U S  Occupation Zone   based at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main   He had no responsibility for the other three zones  controlled by Britain   France and the Soviet Union   except for the city of Berlin   which was managed by the Four Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body  Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps   he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials   He reclassified German prisoners of war  POWs  in U S  custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces  DEFs   who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention  Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff  JCS  in directive JCS 1067   but softened them by bringing in 400 000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization         In response to the devastation in Germany  including food shortages and an influx of refugees  he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment    His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains  while aggressively purging the ex Nazis       In November 1945  Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army  His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers  a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping  Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained  he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs  However  in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets Truman was guided by the U S  State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon   Indeed  Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese  writing   First  the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn t necessary to hit them with that awful thing  Second  I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon     By mid 1947  as EastWest tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated  Eisenhower gave up his hopes for cooperation with the Soviets and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion     In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war  Believing that a general should not participate in politics  one author later wrote that  figuratively speaking   Eisenhower  kicked his political minded visitor out of his office   As others asked him about his political future  Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job  from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe   and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions  In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired  the president would help the general win the 1948 election    and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower s running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination     As the election approached  other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president  In January 1948  after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention   Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was  not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office    life long professional soldiers   he wrote   in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason   should  abstain from seeking high political office     Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time  Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president  Republican Thomas E  Dewey was considered the other probable winner  would presumably serve two terms  and Eisenhower  at age 66 in 1956  would then be too old     In 1948  Eisenhower became President of Columbia University   an Ivy League university in New York  The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction    During that year Eisenhower s memoir  Crusade in Europe   was published    Critics regarded it as one of the finest U S  military memoirs  and it was a major financial success as well  Eisenhower s profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U S  Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer  but rather  marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences  and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his  635 000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate  This ruling saved Eisenhower about  400 000     Eisenhower s stint as the president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within the Council on Foreign Relations   a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the Marshall Plan   and The American Assembly   Eisenhower s  vision of a great cultural center where business  professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature   His biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook suggested that this period served as  the political education of General Eisenhower   since he had to prioritize wide ranging educational  administrative  and financial demands for the university  Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations  he also gained exposure to economic analysis  which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy   Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics  he has learned at the study group meetings   one Aid to Europe member claimed   Eisenhower accepted the presidency of the university to expand his ability to promote  the American form of democracy  through education  He was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee  He informed them that his main purpose was  to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy   As a result  he was  almost incessantly  devoted to the idea of the American Assembly  a concept he developed into an institution by the end of 1950   Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university  Eisenhower was requested to advise U S  Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services  About six months after his appointment  he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington  Two months later he fell ill  and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club   He returned to his post in New York in mid May  and in July 1949 took a two month vacation out of state  Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape  he traveled around the country during mid to late 1950  building financial support from Columbia Associates  an alumni association   Eisenhower was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the Columbia University faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using the university for his own interests  As a career military man  he naturally had little in common with the academics     The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower s bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency  Meanwhile  Columbia University s liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president s ties to oilmen and businessmen  including Leonard McCollum  the president of Continental Oil   Frank Abrams  the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey   Bob Kleberg  the president of the King Ranch  H  J  Porter  a Texas oil executive  Bob Woodruff  the president of the Coca Cola Corporation   and Clarence Francis  the chairman of General Foods    As the president of Columbia  Eisenhower gave voice and form to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of American democracy  His tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership  His biographer Travis Beal Jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the Columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years     The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower s resignation in December 1950  when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe  Eisenhower retired from active service as an Army general on May 31  1952  and he resumed his presidency of Columbia  He held this position until January 20  1953  when he became the President of the United States    NATO did not have strong bipartisan support in Congress at the time that Eisenhower assumed its military command  Eisenhower advised the participating European nations that it would be incumbent upon them to demonstrate their own commitment of troops and equipment to the NATO force before such would come from the war weary United States   At home  Eisenhower was more effective in making the case for NATO in Congress than the Truman administration was  By the middle of 1951  American and European support for NATO was substantial enough to give it a genuine military power  Nevertheless  Eisenhower thought that NATO would become a truly European alliance  with the American and Canadian commitments ending after about ten years     President Truman  symbolizing a broad based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president  again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat  It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans    A   Draft Eisenhower   movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non interventionist Senator Robert A  Taft   The effort was a long struggle  Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate  and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President  Henry Cabot Lodge  who served as his campaign manager  and others succeeded in convincing him  and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full time    Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination  having won critical delegate votes from Texas  Eisenhower s campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan    I Like Ike    It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt s policy at Yalta and against Truman s policies in Korea and Chinamatters in which he had once participated      In defeating Taft for the nomination  it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party  his selection of Richard M  Nixon as the Vice President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose  Nixon also provided a strong anti communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike s more advanced age     In the general election  against the advice of his advisors  Eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South  refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party  The campaign strategy  dubbed  K 1 C 2    was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues  Korea  Communism and corruption  In an effort to accommodate the right  he stressed that the liberation of Eastern Europe should be by peaceful means only  he also distanced himself from his former boss President Truman   Two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff  but did not affect the campaign  One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust  Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage  but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates  The second issue centered on Eisenhower s relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance    Just two weeks prior to the election  Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there  He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO  finally  he stressed a corruption free  frugal administration at home   He defeated Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson in a landslide  with an electoral margin of 442 to 89  marking the first Republican return to the White House in 20 years    In the election he also brought with him a Republican majority in the House  by eight votes  and in the Senate  actually a tie  with Nixon providing the majority vote      Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century  and at age 62  was the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856   President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier     Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency   The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor   Ulysses S  Grant   William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover     Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning  Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations    After selecting his budget director  Joseph M  Dodge   Eisenhower asked Herbert Brownell and Lucius Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments  He accepted their recommendations without exception  they included John Foster Dulles and George M  Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships  and one woman  Oveta Culp Hobby   Eisenhower s cabinet  consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader  was dubbed by one journalist   Eight millionaires and a plumber     The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends  office seekers  or experienced government administrators  He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War     Prior to his inauguration  he led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor addressing foremost issues  agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term  to bring the Korean War to an end  to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent  and to end price and wage controls    Eisenhower also conducted the first pre inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952  he used this meeting to articulate his anti communist Russia policy  His inaugural address as well was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the U  N     Eisenhower made greater use of press conferences than any prior president  holding almost 200 in his two terms  While he saw a positive relationship with the press as invaluable  his primary objective in press conferences was to maintain an indispensable direct contact with the people     Throughout his presidency  Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism    He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation  especially Social Security   He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet level agency  the Department of Health  Education and Welfare   while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers  He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years  which had not been completed under Truman     As the 1954 congressional elections approached  and it became evident that the Republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses  Eisenhower was among those blaming the Old Guard for the losses  and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP  Eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate  progressive Republican   I have just one purpose    and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country  If the right wing wants a fight  they are going to get it    before I end up  either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won t be with them anymore      Initially Eisenhower planned on serving only one term  but as with other decisions he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again  During his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955  he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP s potential candidates  the group  in addition to his doctor  concluded a second term was well advised  and he announced in February 1956 he would run again      Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon s repeating as the Vice President on his ticket  the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition  He personally favored Robert B  Anderson   a Democrat  who rejected his offer  Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party    In 1956  Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide   with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57 6  of the popular vote  The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations     Eisenhower valued the brief respites and the amenities of an office  which he endowed with an arduous daily schedule  He made full use of his valet  chauffeur  and secretarial supporthe rarely drove or dialed a phone number  He was an avid fisherman  golfer  painter  and bridge player  and preferred active rather than passive forms of entertainment    On August 26  1959  Eisenhower was aboard the maiden flight of Air Force One   which replaced the previous Presidential aircraft  the Columbine      One of Eisenhower s enduring achievements was championing and signing the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956    He justified the project through the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 as essential to American security during the Cold War   It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war  hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers   Eisenhower s goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U S  Army s 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy   He was assigned as an observer for the mission  which involved sending a convoy of U S  Army vehicles coast to coast      His subsequent experience with encountering German autobahn limited access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System  Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country  he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U S  would not only be beneficial for military operations  but provide a measure of continued economic growth    The legislation initially stalled in the Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project  but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by Eisenhower in June 1956     In 1953  the Republican Party s Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch  however  the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a practical moot point    At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted  unsuccessfully  to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials  Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower s presidency       Nevertheless  the Cold War escalated during his presidency  When the Soviet Union successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in late November 1955  Eisenhower  against the advice of Dulles  decided to initiate a disarmament proposal to the Soviets  In an attempt to make their refusal more difficult  he proposed that both sides agree to dedicate fissionable material away from weapons toward peaceful uses  such as power generation  This approach was labeled   Atoms for Peace       The U N  speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it  due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U S  arsenal  Indeed  Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons  while reducing conventional forces  and with them the overall defense budget  a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162 2   This approach became known as the   New Look    and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953     In 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament  The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections  In talks located in London that year  they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections  the tables were then turned on Eisenhower  when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U S  to permit inspections  In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria  and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U S   U K  and France    At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called  Open Skies  to facilitate disarmament  which included plans for Russia and the U S  to provide mutual access to each other s skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure  Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand     In 1954  Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America  He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam  this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism  from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India  Likewise  the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico    That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community  EDC  were serious defeats  but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism  saying  Long faces don t win wars     As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC  he afterwards moved to restore Germany  as a full NATO partner     With Eisenhower s leadership and Dulles  direction  CIA activities increased  to resist the spread of communism in poorer countries    the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax   of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess   and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo  Lopoldville      In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union  With Dulles  recommendation  he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U 2  s at a cost of  35 million    The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba   which John F  Kennedy was left to carry out      Over New York City in 1953  Eastern Airlines Flight 8610  a commercial flight  had a near miss with Air Force Flight 8610  a Lockheed C 121 Constellation known as Columbine II   while the latter was carrying President Eisenhower  prompting the adoption of the unique call sign Air Force One whenever the president was on board any US Air Force aircraft  Columbine II is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public and is the only remaining presidential aircraft left unrestored and not on public display         On the whole  Eisenhower s support of the nation s fledgling space program was modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957  gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world  He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education  He rushed construction of more advanced satellites  created NASA as a civilian space agency  signed a landmark science education law  and fostered improved relations with American scientists     In strategic terms  it was Eisenhower who devised the American basic strategy of nuclear deterrence based upon the triad of B 52 bombers  land based intercontinental ballistic missiles  ICBMs   and Polaris submarine launched ballistic missiles  SLBMs      In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate  Once in office  when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary  he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded  His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese    The National Security Council  the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and the Strategic Air Command  SAC  devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China    With the death of Stalin in early March 1953  Russian support for a Chinese hard line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue     In July 1953  an armistice took effect with Korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950   The armistice and boundary remain in effect today  with American soldiers stationed there to guarantee it  The armistice  concluded despite opposition from Secretary Dulles  South Korean President Syngman Rhee   and also within Eisenhower s party  has been described by biographer Ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration  Eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable  and limited war unwinnable     A point of emphasis in Ike s campaign had been his endorsement of a policy of liberation from communism as opposed to a policy of containment  This remained his preference despite the armistice with Korea    Throughout his terms Eisenhower took a hard line attitude toward China  as demanded by conservative Republicans  with the goal of driving a wedge between China and the Soviet Union     Eisenhower continued Truman s policy of recognizing the Republic of China  based in Formosa   Taiwan   as the legitimate government of China  not the Beijing regime  There were localized flare ups when the Red Army began shelling the islands of Quemoy and Matsu in September 1954  Eisenhower received recommendations embracing every variation of response to the aggression of the Chinese communists  He thought it essential to have every possible option available to him as the crisis unfolded     The Sino American Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan was signed in December 1954  He requested and secured from Congress their  Formosa Resolution  in January 1955  which gave Eisenhower unprecedented power in advance to use military force at any level of his choosing in defense of Formoso and the Pescadores  The Resolution bolstered the morale of the Chinese nationalists  and signaled to Beijing that the U S  was committed to holding the line     Eisenhower openly threatened the Chinese with use of nuclear weapons  authorizing a series of bomb tests labeled Operation Teapot   Nevertheless  he left the Chinese communists guessing as to the exact nature of his nuclear response  This allowed Eisenhower to accomplish all of his objectivesthe end of this communist encroachment  the retention of the Islands by the Chinese nationalists and continued peace    Defense of Taiwan from an invasion remains a core American policy     By the end of 1954 Eisenhower s military and foreign policy expertsthe NSC  JCS and State Dept had unanimously urged him  on no less than five occasions  to launch an atomic attack against China  yet he consistently refused to do so and felt a distinct sense of accomplishment in having sufficiently confronted communism while keeping world peace     Even before he was inaugurated Eisenhower accepted a request from the British government to restore the Shah   Mohammad Reza Pahlavi   to power  He therefore authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh     This resulted in an increased strategic control over Iranian oil by U S  and British companies     In November 1956  Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British  French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis   receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser   Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956   He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations  and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt    Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs  which were published in 1965     After the Suez Crisis the United States became the protector of unstable friendly governments in the Middle East via the   Eisenhower Doctrine    Designed by Secretary of State Dulles  it held the U S  would be  prepared to use armed force     to counter  aggression from any country controlled by international communism   Further  the United States would provide economic and military aid and  if necessary  use military force to stop the spread of communism in the Middle East     Eisenhower applied the doctrine in 195758 by dispensing economic aid to shore up the Kingdom of Jordan   and by encouraging Syria  s neighbors to consider military operations against it  More dramatically  in July 1958  he sent 15 000 Marines and soldiers to Lebanon as part of Operation Blue Bat   a non combat peace keeping mission to stabilize the pro Western government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country     The mission proved a success and the Marines departed three months later  The deployment came in response to the urgent request of Lebanese president Camille Chamoun after sectarian violence had erupted in the country  Washington considered the military intervention successful since it brought about regional stability  weakened Soviet influence  and intimidated the Egyptian and Syrian governments  whose anti West political position had hardened after the Suez Crisis     Most Arab countries were skeptical about the  Eisenhower doctrine  because they considered  Zionist imperialism  the real danger  However  they did take the opportunity to obtain free money and weapons  Egypt and Syria  supported by the Soviet Union  openly opposed the initiative  However  Egypt received American aid until the Six Day War in 1967     As the Cold War deepened  Dulles sought to isolate the Soviet Union by building regional alliances of nations against it  Critics sometimes called it   pacto mania       Early in 1953  the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists  supplied from China  who were fighting the First Indochina War   Eisenhower sent Lt  General John W   Iron Mike  O Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there    Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary  Eisenhower stated prophetically that  this war would absorb our troops by divisions      Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non combat personnel  After a few months with no success by the French  he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes  Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet allied participation and congressional approval    When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954  Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  the Vice President and the head of NCS     Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO  Southeast Asia Treaty Organization  Alliance with the U K   France  New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism  At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks  Eisenhower agreed the U S  would participate only as an observer  After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam  Eisenhower rejected the agreement  offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam    Ambrose argues that Eisenhower  by not participating in the Geneva agreement  had kept the U S out of Vietnam  nevertheless  with the formation of SEATO  he had in the end put the U S  back into the conflict     In late 1954  Gen  J  Lawton Collins was made ambassador to  Free Vietnam   the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955   effectively elevating the country to sovereign status  Collins  instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism  by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign    In February 1955  Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem s army  After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam  RVN  commonly known as South Vietnam  in October  Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military  economic  and technical assistance     In the years that followed  Eisenhower increased the number of U S  military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men    This was due to North Vietnam  s support of  uprisings  in the south and concern the nation would fall    In May 1957 Diem  then President of South Vietnam   made a state visit to the United States for ten days  President Eisenhower pledged his continued support  and a parade was held in Diem s honor in New York City  Although Diem was publicly praised  in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives     After the election of November 1960  Eisenhower in briefing with John F  Kennedy pointed out the communist threat in Southeast Asia as requiring prioritization in the next administration  Eisenhower told Kennedy he considered Laos  the cork in the bottle  with regard to the regional threat     On May 1  1960  a U S  one man U 2 spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over Soviet Union airspace  The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an EastWest summit conference  which had been scheduled in Paris  15 days later    Captain Francis Gary Powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil  Four days after Powers disappeared  the Eisenhower Administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had  gone missing  north of Turkey  It speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged  and falsely claimed that  the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties      Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a  spy plane  had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot  As a result  the Eisenhower Administration  thinking the pilot had died in the crash  authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a  weather research aircraft  which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed  difficulties with his oxygen equipment  while flying over Turkey    The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U 2  which had been recovered almost fully intact     The 1960 Four Power Paris Summit between President Dwight Eisenhower  Nikita Khrushchev  Harold Macmillan and Charles de Gaulle collapsed because of the incident  Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev s demands that he apologize  Therefore  Khrushchev would not take part in the summit  Up until this event  Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union  Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit  Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that  stupid U 2 business      The affair was an embarrassment for United States prestige  Further  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a lengthy inquiry into the U 2 incident    In Russia  Captain Powers made a forced confession and apology  On August 19  1960  Powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to imprisonment  On February 10  1962  Powers was exchanged for Rudolf Abel in Berlin and returned to the U S     While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948  actual implementation had been slow  Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953  saying  I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia  including the Federal Government  and any segregation in the Armed Forces     When he encountered opposition from the services  he used government control of military spending to force the change through  stating  Wherever Federal Funds are expended     I do not see how any American can justify    a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds      When Robert B  Anderson   Eisenhower s first Secretary of the Navy   argued that the U S  Navy must recognize the  customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the Navy had no part in creating   Eisenhower overruled him   We have not taken and we shall not take a single backward step  There must be no second class citizens in this country      The administration declared racial discrimination a national security issue  as Communists around the world used the racial discrimination and history of violence in the U S  as a point of propaganda attack     Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children      He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law  The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights  Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation  they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875      In 1957  the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision  Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order  When Faubus balked  the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division   They escorted and protected nine black students   entry to Little Rock Central High School   an all white public school  for the first time since the Reconstruction Era     Martin Luther King Jr  wrote to Eisenhower to thank him for his actions  writing  The overwhelming majority of southerners  Negro and white  stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock      Eisenhower had a Republican Congress for only his first two years in office  in the Senate  the Republican majority was by a one vote margin  Senator Robert A  Taft assisted the President greatly in working with the Old Guard  and was sorely missed when his death  in July 1953  left Eisenhower with his successor William Knowland   whom Eisenhower disliked     This prevented Eisenhower from openly condemning Joseph McCarthy s highly criticized methods against communism  To facilitate relations with Congress  Eisenhower decided to ignore McCarthy s controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the White House  This position drew criticism from a number of corners    In late 1953 McCarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 Senate elections   Eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists    Nevertheless  he refused   Among Ike s objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent McCarthy from dragging the Atomic Energy Commission  AEC  into McCarthy s witch hunt for communists  which would interfere with  and perhaps delay  the AEC s important work on H bombs   The administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the AEC  J  Robert Oppenheimer   had urged that the H bomb work be delayed  Eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance  though he knew this would create fertile ground for McCarthy     In May 1955  McCarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to White House personnel  Eisenhower was furious  and issued an order as follows   It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters    it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications  or any documents or reproductions  concerning such advice be disclosed   This was an unprecedented step by Eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting  and soon became a tradition known as Executive privilege   Ike s denial of McCarthy s access to his staff reduced McCarthy s hearings to rants about trivial matters  and contributed to his ultimate downfall     In early 1954  the Old Guard put forward a constitutional amendment  called the Bricker Amendment   which would curtail international agreements by the Chief Executive  such as the Yalta Agreements   Eisenhower opposed the measure    The Old Guard agreed with Eisenhower on the development and ownership of nuclear reactors by private enterprises  which the Democrats opposed  The President succeeded in getting legislation creating a system of licensure for nuclear plants by the AEC     The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election    Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B  Johnson  later U S  president  in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House  both from Texas  Joe Martin   the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955  wrote that Eisenhower  never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill  There were exceptions  Leonard W  Hall   for example  who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the administration s eyes to the political facts of life  with occasional success  However  these exceptions were not enough to right the balance      Speaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress  with results   often the reverse of what he has desired  because Members of Congress   resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them  The Chief wants this   The administration never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking      Eisenhower appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States    Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired  Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans  while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism    In selecting a Chief Justice Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law and order conservatives  noting privately that Warren  represents the kind of political  economic  and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court    He has a national name for integrity  uprightness  and courage that  again  I believe we need on the Court     In the next few years Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court   In addition to his five Supreme Court appointments  Eisenhower appointed 45 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 129 judges to the United States district courts    Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point  often two or three packs a day   Eisenhower stated that he  gave  himself  an order  to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia      He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office    On September 24  1955  while vacationing in Colorado   he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks  hospitalization  during which time Nixon  Dulles  and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President    He was treated by Dr  Paul Dudley White   a cardiologist with a national reputation  who regularly informed the press of the President s progress  Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President  his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery     As a consequence of his heart attack  Eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm   which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on November 25  1957  This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand  The stroke had caused an aphasia   The president also suffered from Crohn s disease     chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine    which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9  1956    To treat the intestinal block  surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine     His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in Gettysburg  Pennsylvania     He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis   Eisenhower s health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits  but he still indulged in alcohol  During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29  1959  however  before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower  drank several gin and tonics  and one or two gins on the rocks    three or four wines with the dinner      The last three years of Eisenhower s second term in office were ones of relatively good health  Eventually after leaving the White House  he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks    A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs    In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis   for which he underwent surgery on December 12  1966  when his gallbladder was removed  containing 16 gallstones    After Eisenhower s death in 1969  see below   an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma     a benign adrenaline secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease  Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death     The 22nd Amendment to the U S  Constitution was ratified in 1951  and it set term limits to the presidency of two terms  It stipulated that Harry S  Truman   the incumbent at the time  would not be affected by the amendment  After he had been elected to his second presidential term in 1956  Eisenhower became the first U S  president constitutionally prevented from running for re election to the office  having served the maximum two terms   Eisenhower was also the first outgoing President to come under the protection of the Former Presidents Act   two living former Presidents  Herbert Hoover and Harry S  Truman   left office before the Act was passed  Under the act  Eisenhower was entitled to receive a lifetime pension  state provided staff and a Secret Service detail     In the 1960 election to choose his successor  Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President  Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F  Kennedy   He told friends   I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy     He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days  although he may have done Nixon some harm  When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon s policy ideas he had adopted  Eisenhower joked   If you give me a week  I might think of one  I don t remember   Kennedy s campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials  Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy  Eisenhower  who was the oldest president in history at that time  then 70   was succeeded by the youngest elected president  as Kennedy was 43     On January 17  1961  Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office     In his farewell speech   Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U S  armed forces  He described the Cold War   We face a hostile ideology global in scope  atheistic in character  ruthless in purpose and insidious in method     and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that  we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence  whether sought or unsought  by the militaryindustrial complex      He elaborated   we recognize the imperative need for this development    the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist    Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals  so that security and liberty may prosper together      Because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office  Eisenhower had resigned his permanent commission as General of the Army before entering the office of President of the United States  Upon completion of his Presidential term  his commission was reactivated by Congress and Eisenhower again was commissioned a five star general in the United States Army       Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post war time  a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg  Pennsylvania   only thirty miles from his ancestral home of York  In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the National Park Service   In retirement  the former president did not completely retreat from political life  he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg    However  his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as  a dime store New Dealer    On the morning of March 28  1969  at the age of 78  Eisenhower died in Washington  D C  of congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Hospital   The following day his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral  s Bethlehem Chapel  where he lay in repose for 28 hours  On March 30  his body was brought by caisson to the United States Capitol   where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda   On March 31  Eisenhower s body was returned to the National Cathedral   where he was given an Episcopal Church funeral service     That evening  Eisenhower s body was placed onto a train en route to Abilene  Kansas   His body arrived on April 2  and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library   The president s body was buried as a General of the Army  The family used an  80 standard soldier s casket  and dressed Eisenhower s body in his famous short green jacket   His only medals worn were  the Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters  the Navy Distinguished Service Medal  and the Legion of Merit  Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud  who died at age 3 in 1921  His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979     Richard Nixon  then President  spoke of Eisenhower   Some men are considered great because they lead great armies or they lead powerful nations  For eight years now  Dwight Eisenhower has neither commanded an army nor led a nation  and yet he remained through his final days the world s most admired and respected man  truly the first citizen of the world     In the immediate years after Eisenhower left office  his reputation declined  He was widely seen by critics as an inactive  uninspiring president compared to his vigorous young successor  Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock  Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted  Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U 2 incident and the associated international embarrassment      for the Soviet Union s perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race   and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism    In particular  Eisenhower was criticized for failing to defend George Marshall from attacks by Joseph McCarthy   though he privately deplored McCarthy s tactics and claims    Such omissions were held against him during the liberal climate of the 1960s and 1970s  Since that time  however  Eisenhower s reputation has risen  Recent surveys of historians since the 1980s often rank Eisenhower in the top 10 of all U S  presidents   Historian John Lewis Gaddis has summarized the turnaround in evaluations by historians   Historians long ago abandoned the view that Eisenhower s was a failed presidency  He did  after all  end the Korean War without getting into any others  He stabilized  and did not escalate  the Soviet American rivalry  He strengthened European alliances while withdrawing support from European colonialism  He rescued the Republican Party from isolationism and McCarthyism  He maintained prosperity  balanced the budget  promoted technological innovation  facilitated  if reluctantly  the civil rights movement and warned  in the most memorable farewell address since Washington s  of a  militaryindustrial complex  that could endanger the nation s liberties  Not until Reagan would another president leave office with so strong a sense of having accomplished what he set out to do     Although conservatism in politics was strong during the 1950s and Eisenhower generally espoused conservative sentiments  his administration concerned itself mostly with foreign affairs  an area in which the career military president had more knowledge  and pursued a hands off domestic policy  Eisenhower looked to moderation and cooperation as a means of governance     Although he sought to slow or contain the New Deal and other federal programs  he did not attempt to repeal them outright  and in doing so was popular among the liberal wing of the Republican Party    Conservative critics of his administration found that he did not do enough to advance the goals of the right  according to Hans Morgenthau    Eisenhower s victories were but accidents without consequence in the history of the Republican party      Since the 19th century  many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or  gatekeeper   sometimes described as the President s Private Secretary  sometimes with no official title at all    Eisenhower formalized this role  introducing the office of White House Chief of Staff  an idea he borrowed from the United States Army  Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position  Initially  Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter tried to operate without a chief of staff  but each eventually appointed one   As President  Eisenhower also initiated the   up or out   policy in the U S  military  whereby officers who are passed over for promotion twice are usually honorably discharged to make way for younger  more able officers  Eisenhower never forgot his own frustration at being stuck at the rank of major for 16 years between the two world wars   Eisenhower founded People to People International in 1956  based on his belief that citizen interaction would promote cultural interaction and world peace  The program includes a student ambassador component   which sends American youth on educational trips to other countries     During his second term as President  Eisenhower distinctively preserved his presidential gratitude by awarding individuals a special memento  This memento was a series of specially designed U S  Mint presidential appreciation medals  Eisenhower presented the medal as an expression of his appreciation and the medal is a keepsake reminder for the recipient     The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U S  Mint in Philadelphia  The medals were struck from September 1958 though October 1960  A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9 858  Each of the designs incorporates the text  with appreciation  or  with personal and official gratitude  accompanied with Eisenhower s initials  D D E   or facsimile signature  The design also incorporates location  date  and or significant event  Prior to the end of his second term as President  1 451 medals were turned in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed    The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series     Eisenhower is remembered for his role in World War II  the creation of the Interstate Highway System and ending the Korean War    The Interstate Highway System is officially known as the  Dwight D  Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways  in his honor  It was inspired in part by Eisenhower s own Army experiences in World War Two  where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in Germany  Austria  and Switzerland  Commemorative signs reading  Eisenhower Interstate System  and bearing Eisenhower s permanent 5 star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System  Several highways are also named for him  including the Eisenhower Expressway  Interstate 290  near Chicago and the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver    The British A4 class steam locomotive No  4496  renumbered 60008  Golden Shuttle was renamed

  all the way to the suburbs of New York City     citation needed    In 1983  The Eisenhower Institute was founded in Washington  D C   as a policy institute to advance Eisenhower s intellectual and leadership legacies   In 1989  U S  Ambassador Charles Price and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dedicated a bronze statue of Eisenhower in Grosvenor Square   London  The statue is located in front of the current U S  Embassy  London and across from the former command center for the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II  offices Eisenhower occupied during the war     In 1999  the United States Congress created the Dwight D  Eisenhower Memorial Commission  to create an enduring national memorial in Washington  D C   In 2009  the commission chose the architect Frank Gehry to design the memorial      The memorial will stand near the National Mall on Maryland Avenue  SW across the street from the National Air and Space Museum      On May 7  2002  the Old Executive Office Building was officially renamed the Eisenhower Executive Office Building  This building is part of the White House Complex   and is west of the West Wing   It currently houses a number of executive offices  including ones for the Vice President and his or her spouse     A county park in East Meadow   New York   Long Island   is named in his honor    Eisenhower State Park on Lake Texoma near his

among DoD courses  is named in his honor   Eisenhower Park on Washington Square in Newport  Rhode Island   dedicated by President Eisenhower in 1960   The 18th hole at Cherry Hills Country Club   near Denver   is named in his honor  Eisenhower was a longtime member of the club  which operated one of his favorite courses     A loblolly pine   known as the  Eisenhower Pine   was located on Augusta s 17th hole  approximately 210 yards  192 m  from the Masters tee  President Dwight D  Eisenhower  an Augusta National member  hit the tree so many times that  at a 1956 club meeting  he proposed that it be cut down  Not wanting to offend the president  the club s chairman  Clifford Roberts   immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request  The tree was removed in February 2014 after an ice storm caused it significant damage     During a visit to Augusta National  then General Eisenhower returned from a walk through the woods on the eastern part of the grounds  and informed Clifford Roberts that he had found a perfect place to build a dam if the club would like a fish pond  Ike s Pond was built and named  and the dam is located just where Eisenhower said it should be

to people of all races    In 1950  Bill s mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton  Sr    who owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs  Arkansas   with his brother and Earl T  Ricks     The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950   Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather s surname  it was not until Clinton turned fifteen   that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather    Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half brother  Roger Clinton  Jr    to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them       In Hot Springs  Clinton attended St  John s Catholic Elementary School  Ramble Elementary School   and Hot Springs High School  where he was an active student leader  avid reader  and musician    Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone   winning first chair in the state band s saxophone section  He briefly considered dedicating his life to music  but as he noted in his autobiography My Life    Sometime in my sixteenth year  I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official  I loved music and thought I could be very good  but I knew I would never be John Coltrane or Stan Getz   I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor  but I knew I would never be Michael DeBakey   But I knew I could be great in public service     Clinton s interest in law also began in Hot Springs High  when in his Latin class he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial    After a vigorous defense that made use of his  budding rhetorical and political skills   he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck that it  made him realize that someday he would study law      Clinton has named two influential moments in his life that contributed to his decision to become a public figure  both occurring in 1963  One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F  Kennedy       The other was listening to Martin Luther King  Jr   s 1963 I Have a Dream speech  which impressed him enough that he later memorized it     With the aid of scholarships  Clinton attended the Edmund A  Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington  D C   receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service  B S   degree in 1968  In 1964 and 1965 he won elections for class president     From 1964 to 1967 he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J  William Fulbright     While in college  he became a brother of co ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega   and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa   Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay     a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry  but he never became a Freemason   He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity     Upon graduation  he won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College  Oxford where he studied Philosophy  Politics and Economics   though because he had switched programs and had left early for Yale University  he did not receive a degree there        He developed an interest in rugby union   playing at Oxford   and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas    citation needed    While at Oxford he also participated in Vietnam War protests and organized an October 1969 Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event     Clinton received Vietnam War draft deferments during 1968 and 1969 while he was in England    Planning to attend law school in the U S  and aware that he might lose his draft deferment  he tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force   and then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers  Training Corps  ROTC  program at the University of Arkansas      He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC  saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program he had planned to join that he opposed the war  but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC  National Guard  or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam  He further stated that because he opposed the war  he would not volunteer to serve in uniform  but would subject himself to the draft  and would serve if selected only as a way  to maintain my political viability within the system     Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number  311   meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would have to be drafted before him  which was unlikely  Clinton s political opponents charge that he used Fulbright s influence to avoid military service    Colonel Eugene Holmes  the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton s ROTC application  suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform  He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign   I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fulbright s office that Bill Clinton  a Rhodes Scholar  should be admitted to the ROTC program I believe that he purposely deceived me  using the possibility of joining the ROTC as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification     During the 1992 campaign it was revealed that Clinton s uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve   which would have kept him from going to Vietnam  This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then    Although legal  Clinton s actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans during his first presidential campaign    Clinton s 1992 campaign manager  James Carville   successfully argued that Clinton s letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public  insisting that voters  many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War  would understand and appreciate his position     After Oxford  Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor  J D   degree in 1973      In the Yale Law Library in 1971 he met fellow law student Hillary Rodham   who was a year ahead of him      They began dating and soon were inseparable  After only about a month  Clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California    They married on October 11  1975  and their only child  Chelsea   was born on February 27  1980     Clinton did eventually move to Texas with Rodham to take a job leading George McGovern  s effort there in 1972  He spent considerable time in Dallas   at the campaign s local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue  where he had an office  Clinton worked with future two term mayor of Dallas   Ron Kirk   future governor of Texas   Ann Richards   and then unknown television director  and future filmmaker  Steven Spielberg     citation needed    After graduating from Yale Law School  Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas   In 1974 he ran for the House of Representatives   Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt   Clinton s campaign was bolstered by the anti Republican and anti incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal   Hammerschmidt  who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972  defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin  In 1976 Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General   With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election    Clinton was elected     Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978  having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe   a farmer from Texarkana   He became the youngest governor in the country at 32  Due to his youthful appearance  Clinton was often called the  Boy Governor         He worked on educational reform and Arkansas s roads  with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform  However  his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens  anger over the escape of Cuban refugees  from the Mariel boatlift   detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980  Monroe Schwarzlose of Kingsland in Cleveland County   polled 31percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980  Some suggested Schwarzlose s unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton s defeat in the general election that year by Republican challenger Frank D  White   As Clinton once joked  he was the youngest ex governor in the nation s history     Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey  s Little Rock law firm of Wright  Lindsey and Jennings    In 1982  he was again elected governor and kept the office for ten years  beginning with the 1986 election  Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years  During his term he helped transform Arkansas s economy and improved the state s educational system    For senior citizens   he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property tax exemption    He became a leading figure among the New Democrats   a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform  smaller government  and other policies not supported by liberals  Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council  DLC   the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan  s landslide victory in 1984   the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level      Clinton delivered the Democratic response to President Reagan s 1985 State of the Union Address and served as Chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987  bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas     In the early 1980s  Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority  Chaired by Clinton s wife Hillary Rodham Clinton   also an attorney and chair of the Legal Services Corporation   the Arkansas Education Standards Committee transformed Arkansas s education system from the worst in the United States to one of the best  Proposed reforms included more spending for schools  supported by a sales tax increase   better opportunities for gifted children  vocational education  higher teachers  salaries  more course variety  and compulsory teacher competency exams  The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session the longest in Arkansas history    Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship      He defeated four Republican candidates for governor  Lowe  1978   White  1982 and 1986   Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman  1984   and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock  1990      The Clintons  personal and business affairs in the 1980s included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation that later dogged his presidential administration    After extensive investigation over several years  no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas       According to some sources  Clinton was in his early years a death penalty opponent who switched positions      During Clinton s term  Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964  the death penalty had been re enacted on March 23  1973     As Governor  he oversaw four executions  one by electric chair and three by lethal injection   Later  as president  Clinton was the first President to pardon a death row inmate since the federal death penalty was reintroduced in 1988     In 1987  there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then  New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity  Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor  following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor  initially favored but ultimately vetoed by the First Lady     For the nomination  Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis   He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention   but his speech  which was 33 minutes long and twice as long as it was expected to be  was criticized for being too long   and poorly delivered    Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party  he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991       During his presidency  Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs   much of which was enacted into law or was implemented by the executive branch  His policies  particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform   have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance      On budgetary matters his policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits      Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history        The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of  69billion in 1998   126billion in 1999  and  236billion in 2000    during the last three years of Clinton s presidency    The U S  treasury reported a debt of  5 413 trillion in 1997  and a debt of  5 656 trillion in 1999    At the end of his presidency  Clinton moved to New York and helped his wife win election to the U S  Senate there   In the first primary contest  the Iowa caucus   Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin   During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary   reports of an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers surfaced  As Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls    following Super Bowl XXVI   Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges  Their television appearance was a calculated risk  but Clinton regained several delegates  He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary   but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning  the media viewed it as a victory  News outlets labeled him  The Comeback Kid  for earning a firm second place finish     Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead  However  former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South      With no major Southern state remaining  Clinton targeted New York  which had many delegates  He scored a resounding victory in New York City  shedding his image as a regional candidate    Having been transformed into the consensus candidate  he secured the Democratic Party nomination  finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown  s home state of California     During the campaign  questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm   at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner  arose  Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary s firm pay      Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that  with Hillary  voters would be getting two presidents  for the price of one      While campaigning for U S  President  the then Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed  After killing a police officer and a civilian  Rector shot himself in the head  leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death  According to Arkansas state and Federal law  a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed  The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution  Clinton s return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a The New York Times article as a possible political move to counter  soft on crime  accusations       Because Bush s approval ratings were around 80percent during the Gulf War   he was described as unbeatable  However  when Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits  he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes   hurting his approval rating  Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep    By election time  the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40percent      Finally  conservatives were previously united by anti communism  but with the end of the Cold War  the party lacked a uniting issue  When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention  with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform many moderates were alienated    Clinton then pointed to his moderate   New Democrat  record as governor of Arkansas  though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious    Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton    Clinton and his running mate  Al Gore   toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign  shoring up support and pledging a  new beginning      Clinton won the 1992 presidential election  43 0percent of the vote  against Republican incumbent George H  W  Bush  37 4percent of the vote  and billionaire populist Ross Perot   who ran as an independent  18 9percent of the vote  on a platform focusing on domestic issues  a significant part of Clinton s success was Bush s steep decline in public approval    Clinton s election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty four years  The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress     the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 95th United States Congress during the Jimmy Carter presidency in the late 1970s       Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20  1993  Shortly after taking office  Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 on February 5  which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition  This action had bipartisan support    and proved quite popular with the public     Two days after taking office  on January 22  1993the 20th anniversary of the U S  Supreme Court decision in Roe v  Wade   Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Clinton s predecessors  Ronald Regan and George H W  Bush    Clinton said that abortion should be kept  safe  legal  and rare a slogan that had been suggested by University of California  San Diego political scientist Samuel L  Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991  while campaigning    During the eight years of the Clinton administration  the U S  abortion rate declined by about 18 4 percent     On February 15  1993  Clinton made his first address to the nation  announcing his plan to raise taxes to cap the budget deficit     Two days later  in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress   Clinton unveiled his economic plan  The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class  which had been high on his campaign agenda    Clinton s advisers pressured him to raise taxes on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates     On May 19  1993  Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office  causing the White House travel office controversy even though the Travel Office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause   The White House responded to the controversy by claiming the firings were done because of financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation    Critics contended the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted      Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal  There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America    Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 in August of that year  which passed Congress without a Republican vote  It cut taxes for fifteen million low income families  made tax cuts available to 90percent of small businesses    and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 2percent of taxpayers  Additionally  through the implementation of spending restraints  it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years     Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan on September 22  1993  aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan  This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton s legislative agenda  and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton   Though at first well received in political circles  it was eventually doomed by well organized opposition from conservatives  the American Medical Association   and the health insurance industry  However  John F  Harris   a biographer of Clinton s  states the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House     Despite the Democratic majority in Congress  the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J  Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994  It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton s administration       In November 1993  David Hale   the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy   alleged that Clinton  while governor of Arkansas  pressured him to provide an illegal  300 000 loan to Susan McDougal  the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal    A U S  Securities and Exchange Commission investigation did result in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project  but the Clintons themselves were never charged  and Clinton maintains innocence in the affair   Clinton signed the Brady Bill into law on November 30  1993  which imposed a five day waiting period on handgun purchases  He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit   a subsidy for low income workers     In December of that year  allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in the American Spectator   Later known as Troopergate   the allegations by these men were that they arranged sexual liaisons for Bill Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas  The story mentioned a woman named Paula   a reference to Paula Jones   Brock later apologized to Clinton  saying the article was politically motivated  bad journalism  and that  the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives      That month  Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as   Don t Ask  Don t Tell    which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a secret  and forbade the military from inquiring about an individual s sexual orientation    The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton s proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats  including Senators John McCain  R AZ  and Sam Nunn  D GA   According to David Mixner   Clinton s support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore  who felt that  the President should lift the ban  even though  his executive order  was sure to be overridden by the Congress     Some gay rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions    Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order  noting that President Harry Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces  Clinton s defenders argue that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law  potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future    Later in his presidency  in 1999  Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented  saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not  out of whack     The policy remained controversial  and was finally repealed in 2011   removing open sexual preference as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces     On January 1  1994  Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law    Throughout his first year in office  Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U S  Senate  Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures  there remained  however  strong disagreement within the party  Opposition came chiefly from anti trade Republicans  protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot   The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed  132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor  156 Democrats  43 Republicans  and 1 independent against   The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President     The Omnibus Crime Bill which Clinton signed into law in 1994   made many changes to U S  crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death  such as running a large scale drug enterprise  During Clinton s re election campaign he said   My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins  murderers of federal law enforcement officers  and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons       When I took office  only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the Worldwide Web Now even my cat has its own page    The Clinton administration also launched the first official White House website  whitehouse gov   on October 21  1994      It was followed by three more versions  resulting in the final edition launched in 2000      The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web based communication  According to Robert Longley   Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies  the U S  court system and the U S  military onto the Internet  thus opening up America s government to more of America s citizens than ever before  On July 17  1996  Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 Federal Information Technology  ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public      After two years of Democratic Party control  the Democrats lost control of Congress in the mid term elections in 1994   for the first time in forty years     Ken Gormley   Dean of the School of Law at Duquesne University in Pittsburg  authored a book titled The Death of American Virtue  Clinton vs  Starr   In his book  Gormley reveals President Clinton narrowly escaped assassination in the Philippines in 1996  During his visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC  forum in Manila  Clinton was saved minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device  IED     According to officials  the IED was large enough to  blow up the entire presidential motorcade     Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis Merletti   former member of the Presidential Protection Detail and Director of the Secret Service   The President was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government when disaster was averted  Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge    This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton s motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila    Once more  the word  wedding  was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt    Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade  but the alternate route would add forty five minutes to the drive time  Clinton was very angry  as he was already late for the meeting  however  following the advice of the secret service saved his life  Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high    Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag    Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U S  naval base    The President was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week  An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden     Until recently  this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret  Only top members of the U S  intelligence community were aware of these events     The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security clearance documents  Craig Livingstone  head of the White House Office of Personnel Security  improperly requested  and received from the FBI  background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals  many of these were employees of former Republican administrations    In March 2000  Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any crime  Ray s report further stated   there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved  in seeking the files     On September 21  1996  Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act  DOMA   which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman  allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states    Paul Yandura   speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office  said that Clinton s signing of DOMA  was a political decision that they made at the time of a re election   In defense of his actions  Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to  head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states   a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a  very reactionary Congress     Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said   the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse  and it was time to move on and get the president re elected     Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something  which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for President Bush up  I think it s obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that     Others were more critical  The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims  historic revisionism     In a July 2  2011 editorial The New York Times opined   The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election year wedge issue  signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments      In June 2013  the United States Supreme Court  in United States v  Windsor   struck down DOMA     Despite DOMA  Clinton was the first President to select openly gay persons for Administration positions    and is generally credited as the first President to publicly champion gay rights    During his Presidency  Clinton controversially issued two substantial executive orders on behalf of gay rights  the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees   and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce    Under President Clinton s leadership  federal funding for HIV AIDS research  prevention and treatment more than doubled    And Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non Discrimination Act   which  buoyed by his lobbying  failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996    Advocacy for these issues  paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time  led to enthusiastic support for Clinton s election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign     Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009   and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013    He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro gay stances and his reversal on DOMA     As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration   Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act  IIRIRA  on September 30  1996  Appointed by Clinton    the U S  Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800 000 people a year to about 550 000       The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People s Republic of China  PRC  to influence the domestic policies of the United States  before and during the Clinton administration  and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself  The Chinese government denied all accusations     In the 1996 presidential election   Clinton was re elected  receiving 49 2percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole  40 7percent of the popular vote  and Reform candidate Ross Perot  8 4percent of the popular vote   becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D  Roosevelt to be elected President more than once    The Republicans lost a few seats in the House and gained a few in the Senate  but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress   Clinton received 379  or over 70percent of the Electoral College votes  with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes   In the January 1997 State of the Union address  Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide coverage to up to five million children  Senators Ted Kennedy  a Democrat and Orrin Hatch  a Republican teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997  and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   the largest  successful  health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency  That year  Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act   He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress  In October 1997  he announced he was getting hearing aids  due to hearing loss attributed to his age  and his time spent as a musician in his youth    In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm Leach Bliley Act   which repealed the part of the GlassSteagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment   commercial banking   and insurance services since its enactment in 1933     After the 1998 elections  the House impeached Clinton   alleging perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Lewinsky scandal     Clinton was only the second U S  President to be impeached  after Andrew Johnson   Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22 year old White House  and later Department of Defense   employee Monica Lewinsky     After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed  substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment     the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid term elections   To hold impeachment proceedings  the Republican leadership called a lame duck session in December 1998   While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party line vote  there was lively debate on the House floor  The two charges passed in the House  largely with Republican support  but with a handful of Democratic votes as well  were for perjury and obstruction of justice   The perjury charge arose from Clinton s testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Paula Jones  s sexual harassment lawsuit    The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition   The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges    The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term  so the trial was held over until the next Congress  Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams   Connolly     The Senate finished a twenty one day trial on February 12  1999  with the vote of 55 Not Guilty 45 Guilty on the perjury charge   and 50 Not Guilty 50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge    Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder  The final vote was generally along party lines  with no Democrats voting guilty  and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty     Clinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20  2001      Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton s brother  Hugh Rodham   accepted payments in return for influencing the president s decision making regarding the pardons    Some of Clinton s pardons remain a point of controversy     Many military events occurred during Clinton s presidency  The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993  During the operation  two U S  helicopters were shot down by rocket propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors   trapping soldiers behind enemy lines  This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers  wounded 73 others  and one was taken prisoner  There were many more Somali casualties  Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets a spectacle broadcast on television news programs  In response  U S  forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground  In 1995  U S  and NATO aircraft attacked Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U N  safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord  Clinton deployed U S  peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995  to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement    In February 1996  the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US 131 8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U S  in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U S  Navy guided missile cruiser      Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U S  government during the presidency of Bill Clinton  and continued to be until bin Laden s death in 2011      Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden and that that U S  authorities rejected each offer   the 9 11 Commission Report stated that  we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim      In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the 1998 bombings of U S  embassies in East Africa by al Qaeda  which killed 224 people  including 12 Americans   Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden  both of which were unsuccessful    In August 1998  Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan   targeting the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan  which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons  and bin Laden s terrorist training camps in Afghanistan     To stop the ethnic cleansing and genocide     of Albanians by anti guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  s province of Kosovo   Clinton authorized the use of U S  Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999  named Operation Allied Force   General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission  With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244   the bombing campaign ended on June 10  1999  The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region    NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths    and two deaths from an Apache helicopter crash    Opinions in the popular press criticized pre war genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated      In 2001  the U N  supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide did not take place  but recognized  a systematic campaign of terror  including murders  rapes  arsons and severe maltreatments     The term  ethnic cleansing  was used as an alternative to  genocide  to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement  though critics charge there is no difference    Slobodan Miloevi    the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities  was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges of crimes against humanity   genocide  and war crimes    Miloevi  died in 2006  before the completion of the trial       In Clinton s 1998 State of the Union Address   he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was possibly pursuing nuclear weapons   Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons   and the outlaw states  terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them  Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade  and much of his nation s wealth  not on providing for the Iraqi people  but on developing nuclear  chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them  The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job  finding and destroying more of Iraq s arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war  Now  Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission  I know I speak for everyone in this chamber  Republicans and Democrats  when I say to Saddam Hussein   You cannot defy the will of the world   and when I say to him   You have used weapons of mass destruction before  we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again     Seeking to weaken Saddam Hussein s grip of power  Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31  1998  which instituted a policy of  regime change  against Iraq  though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces      The administration then launched a four day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox   lasting from December 16 to 19  1998  At the end of this operation Clinton announced that  So long as Saddam remains in power  he will remain a threat to his people  his region  and the world  With our allies  we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program  while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors     American and British aircraft in the Iraq no fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000       Clinton s November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U S  president since the end of the Vietnam War     On October 10  2000  Clinton signed into law the U S China Relations Act of 2000   which granted permanent normal trade relations  PNTR  trade status to People s Republic of China    The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform    Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U S  economy  Under Clinton  the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969     After initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s  Clinton attempted to address the ArabIsraeli conflict   Clinton brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the 2000 Camp David Summit     Following the peace talk failures  Clinton stated Arafat  missed the opportunity  to facilitate a  just and lasting peace   In his autobiography   Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit      The situation broke down completely with the start of the Second Intifada      Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court   Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993   and Stephen Breyer in 1994     Along with his two Supreme Court appointments  Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts   His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan  Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies   as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican  controlled Senate Judiciary Committee   In all  84percent of his nominees were confirmed     Among the judges appointed by Clinton to the courts of appeals was Sonia Sotomayor   who was nominated by Clinton in 1997 to the Second Circuit and confirmed in 1998  following a delay of more than a year caused by Republican opposition       Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts    In his eight years in office  11 6  of Clinton s court of appeals nominees and 17 4  of his district court nominees were black  32 8  of his court of appeals nominees and 28 5  of his district court nominees were women    Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit   Roger L  Gregory   and the Seventh Circuit   Ann C  Williams      Clinton also appointed the nation s first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah A  Batts to the U S  District Court for the Southern District of New York   Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994     Clinton s job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s throughout his first term  In his second term  his rating consistently ranged from the high 50s to the high 60s    After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999  Clinton s rating reached its highest point    According to a CBS News   New York Times poll  Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68percent  which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D  Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era    Clinton s average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61   the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years    Forty seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters     As he was leaving office  a CNN  USA Today  Gallup poll revealed that 45percent of Americans said they would miss him  55percent thought he  would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life   68percent thought he would be remembered more for his  involvement in personal scandal  than for  his accomplishments   and 58percent answered  No  to the question  Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy     The same percentage said he would be remembered as either  outstanding  or  above average  as a president  while 22percent said he would be remembered as  below average  or  poor     ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as   You can t trust him  he s got weak morals and ethics  and he s done a heck of a good job      In May 2006  a CNN poll comparing Clinton s job performance with that of his successor  George W  Bush  found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned    Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13  of Americans as the greatest president in U S  history       In 2014  18  of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II  making him the third most popular among postwar presidents  behind John F  Kennedy and Ronald Reagan     The same poll showed that just 3  of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II     A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U S  presidents in order of greatness  According to their findings  Clinton ranked eighth overall  with a rating of 70 percent     As the first baby boomer president  Clinton was the first president in more than half a century not to have been alive during World War II    Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward state Clinton s innovative use of sound bite  ready dialogue  personal charisma  and public perception oriented campaigning was a major factor in his high public approval ratings      When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show   he was described by some religious conservatives as  the MTV president     Opponents sometimes referred to him as  Slick Willie   a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg     Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller   Dale Bumpers and David Pryor     The claim  Slick Willie  would last throughout his presidency    Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in  1 88m   Clinton is tied with five others as the fourth tallest president in the nation s history      His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba   especially in the South     Since 2000  he has frequently been referred to as  The Big Dog  or  Big Dog       His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention   where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail  earned him the nickname  Explainer in Chief        Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and made improving race relations a major theme of his presidency    In 1998  Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton  the first Black president   saying   Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness  single parent household  born poor  working class  saxophone playing  McDonald s  and junk food loving boy from Arkansas     Noting that Clinton s sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments  Morrison compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that blacks typically endure     Shortly after he took office  conservative newspaper owner Richard Mellon Scaife organized a fundraising campaign to smear Clinton s image in the media    Leading the Arkansas Project   Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton s home state of Arkansas who would be willing to dish out negative allegations against the President     In 1994  Paula Jones brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton  claiming he made unwanted advances in 1991  which he denied  In April 1998  the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright as lacking legal merit    But Jones appealed Webber Wright s ruling  and her suit gained traction following Clinton s admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998    In 1998  lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents contending a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas  Robert S  Bennett   Clinton s main lawyer for the case  called the filing  a pack of lies  and  an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States  funded by Clinton s political enemies    Clinton later agreed to an out of court settlement  paying  850 000    Bennett said that the President only made the settlement so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life    During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit  which was held at the White House    Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky   a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury     In 1992  Gennifer Flowers stated that she had a relationship with Clinton that began in 1980    Flowers at first denied that she had an affair with Clinton  but later changed her story      After Clinton at first denied having a relationship with Flowers on 60 Minutes   he later admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers     In 1998  Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton groped her in a hallway in 1993  An independent counsel determined Willey gave  false information  to the FBI  inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation    On March 19  1998  Julie Hiatt Steele  a friend of Willey  released an affidavit   accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms  Willey s account of being sexually groped by President Clinton in the Oval Office    An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct    Linda Tripp  s grand jury testimony also differed from Willey s claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances     Also in 1998  Juanita Broaddrick alleged Clinton had raped her though she did not remember the exact date  which may have been 1978    In another 1998 event  Elizabeth Ward Gracen recanted a six year old denial and stated she had a one night stand with Clinton in 1982    Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton    Throughout the year  however  Gracen eluded a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court     Bill Clinton continues to be active in public life  giving speeches  fundraising  and founding charitable organizations    Clinton has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention since 1988     In 2002  Clinton warned that pre emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences      and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start  though some dispute this     In 2005  Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control  while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Montreal     The William J  Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock  Arkansas was dedicated in 2004    Clinton released a best selling autobiography  My Life in 2004    In 2007  he released Giving  How Each of Us Can Change the World   which also became a The New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews     In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami   U N  Secretary General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort    After Hurricane Katrina   Clinton joined with fellow former President George H  W  Bush to establish the Bush Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005  and the Bush Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year    As part of the tsunami effort  these two ex presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre game show    and traveled to the affected areas    They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in 2007     Based on his philanthropic worldview    Clinton created the William J  Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance  This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative  CHAI   which strives to combat that disease  and has worked with the Australian government toward that end  The Clinton Global Initiative  CGI   begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005

manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools    Clinton s foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities  and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative    The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world  including Asia and the Middle East    In 2008  Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti malaria drugs by 30percent in developing nations    Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy   which was voted down     During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign   Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife  Hillary Clinton   Through speaking engagements and fundraisers  he was able to raise  10million toward her campaign    Some worried that as an ex president  he was too active on the trail  too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama  and alienating his supporters at home and abroad    Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary  which Obama won  Later in the 2008 primaries  there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary s staffs  especially in Pennsylvania    Considering Bill s remarks  many thought that he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary    Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama s election  Fears were allayed August 27  2008  when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention   saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is  ready to lead     After Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign was over  Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt       In 2009  Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned in North Korea   Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for

American Revolutionary War   and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States   He presided over the convention that drafted the current United States Constitution and during his lifetime was called the   father of his country       Widely admired for his strong leadership qualities  Washington was unanimously elected President in the first two national elections  He oversaw the creation of a strong  well financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars   suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion   and won acceptance among Americans of all types    Washington s incumbency established many precedents  still in use today  such as the cabinet system   the inaugural address   and the title Mr  President       His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition which was unbroken until 1940    Born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia   his family were wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves which he inherited  he owned hundreds of slaves throughout his lifetime  but his views on slavery evolved  In his youth he became a senior British officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the French and Indian War   In 1775  the Second Continental Congress commissioned Washington as commander in chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution  In that command  Washington forced the British out of Boston in 1776  but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he lost New York City   After crossing the Delaware River in the middle of winter  he defeated the British in two battles  retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause  This is known as the Battle of Trenton    His strategy enabled Continental forces to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781   Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals  preservation and command of the army  coordination with the Congress  with state governors and their militia  and attention to supplies  logistics  and training  In battle  however  Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies  After victory had been finalized in 1783  Washington resigned as commander in chief rather than seize power  proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism      Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787   which devised a new form of federal government for the United States  Following unanimous election as President in 1789   he worked to unify rival factions

created a national bank    In avoiding war with Great Britain  he guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795  despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians   Although he remained nonpartisan  never joining the Federalist Party   he largely supported their policies  Washington s Farewell Address was an influential primer on republican virtue   warning against partisanship  sectionalism  and involvement in foreign wars  He retired from the presidency in 1797  returning to his home and plantation at Mount Vernon    While in power  his use of national authority pursued many ends  especially the preservation of liberty  reduction of regional tensions  and promotion of a spirit of American nationalism    Upon his death  Washington was eulogized as  first in war  first in peace  and first in the hearts of his countrymen  by Henry Lee     Revered in life and in death  scholarly and public polling consistently ranks him among the top

calendar and Annunciation Style of enumerating years  then in use in the British Empire  Washington was born on February 11  1731  the Gregorian calendar   adopted in the British Empire in 1752  rendered a birth date of February 22  1732      Note 1     Note 2    Washington was of primarily English gentry descent  especially from Sulgrave   England  His great grandfather  John Washington   emigrated to Virginia in 1657 and began accumulating land and slaves  as did his son Lawrence and his grandson  George s father  Augustine  Augustine was a tobacco planter who also tried his hand in iron mining ventures    In George s youth  the Washingtons were moderately prosperous members of the Virginia gentry   of  middling rank  rather than one of the leading planter families    At this time  Virginia and other southern colonies had become a slave society  in which slaveholders formed the ruling class and the economy was based upon slave labor     Six of George s siblings reached maturity  including two older half brothers  Lawrence and Augustine   from his father s first marriage to Jane Butler Washington  and four full siblings  Samuel   Elizabeth  Betty    John Augustine and Charles   Three siblings died before adulthood  his full sister Mildred died when she was about one  his half brother Butler died in infancy    and his half sister Jane died aged of twelve  when George was about two    His father died when George was eleven years old and his half brother Lawrence became a surrogate father and role model  William Fairfax   Lawrence s father in law and cousin of Virginia s largest landowner  Thomas  Lord Fairfax   was also a formative influence   Washington spent much of his boyhood at Ferry Farm in Stafford County near Fredericksburg   Lawrence Washington inherited another family property from his father  a plantation on the Potomac River   which he named Mount Vernon   in honor of his commanding officer  Admiral Edward Vernon   George inherited Ferry Farm upon his father s death and eventually acquired Mount Vernon after Lawrence s death     The death of his father prevented Washington from an education at England s Appleby School  as his older brothers had received  He achieved the equivalent of an elementary school education from a variety of tutors  as well as from school run by an Anglican clergyman in or near Fredericksburg      Talk of securing an appointment in the Royal Navy for him when he was 15 was dropped when his widowed mother objected    Thanks to Lawrence s connection to the powerful Fairfax family  at age 17 in 1749  Washington was appointed official surveyor for Culpeper County   a well paid position which enabled him to purchase land in the Shenandoah Valley   the first of his many land acquisitions in western Virginia  Thanks also to Lawrence s involvement in the Ohio Company   a land investment company funded by Virginia investors  and Lawrence s position as commander of the Virginia militia  Washington came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia  Robert Dinwiddie   Washington was hard to miss  At exactly six feet  he towered over most of his contemporaries     In 1751  Washington traveled to Barbados with Lawrence  who was suffering from tuberculosis   with the hope that the climate would be beneficial to Lawrence s health  Washington contracted smallpox during the trip  which left his face slightly scarred  but immunized him against future exposures to the dreaded disease    However  Lawrence s health failed to improve  and he returned to Mount Vernon  where he would die in 1752    Lawrence s position as Adjutant General  militia leader  of Virginia was divided into four offices after his death  Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753  with the rank of major in the Virginia militia    During this period  Washington became a Freemason while in Fredericksburg  although his involvement was minimal     The Ohio Company was an important vehicle through which British investors planned to expand into the Ohio Valley   opening new settlements and trading posts for the Indian trade    In 1753  the French themselves began expanding their military control into the Ohio Country   a territory already claimed by the British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania  These competing claims led to a war in the colonies called the French and Indian War  175462   and contributed to the start of the global Seven Years  War  175663   By chance  Washington became involved in its beginning   Robert Dinwiddie   lieutenant governor of colonial Virginia   was ordered by the British government to guard the British territorial claims including the Ohio River basin  In late 1753 Dinwiddie ordered Washington to deliver a letter asking the French to vacate the Ohio Valley     he was eager to prove himself as the new adjutant general of the militia  appointed by the Lieutenant Governor himself only a year before  During his trip Washington met with Tanacharison  also called  Half King   and other Iroquois chiefs allied with England at Logstown to secure their support in case of a military conflict with the Frenchindeed Washington and Tanacharison became friends  He delivered the letter to the local French commander Jacques Legardeur de Saint Pierre   who politely refused to leave    Washington kept a diary during his expedition which was printed by William Hunter on Dinwiddie s order and which made Washington s name recognizable in Virginia    This increased notoriety helped him to obtain a commission to raise a company of 100 men and start his military career     Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the Ohio Country to safeguard an Ohio Company s construction of a fort at present day Pittsburgh   Pennsylvania  However  before he reached the area  a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne   A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville   was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present day Uniontown  Pennsylvania   On May 28  1754 Washington and some of his militia unit  aided by their Mingo allies  ambushed the French in what has come to be called the Battle of Jumonville Glen   Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention  but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes  that Jumonville was killed  and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner  Whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington or by another means  is not completely clear      He was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison     The French responded by attacking and capturing Washington at Fort Necessity in July 1754    However  he was allowed to return with his troops to Virginia  Historian Joseph Ellis concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington s bravery  initiative  inexperience and impetuosity    These events had international consequences  the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville  who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission    Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755  war was formally declared in 1756     In 1755  Washington became the senior American aide to British General Edward Braddock on the ill fated Braddock expedition  This was the largest British expedition to the colonies  and was intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country  the first objective was the capture of Fort Duquesne     Washington initially sought from Braddock an appointment as a major  but upon advice that no rank above captain could be given except by London  he agreed to serve as a staff volunteer  During the passage of the expedition  Washington fell ill with severe headaches and fever  nevertheless  when the pace of the troops continued to slow  Washington recommended to Braddock that the army be split into two divisions  a primary and more lightly  but adequately equipped   flying column  offensive which could move at a more rapid pace  to be followed by a more heavily armed reinforcing division  Braddock accepted the recommendation  likely made in a council of war including other officers  and took command of the lead division       In the Battle of the Monongahela the French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock s reduced forces and the general was mortally wounded  After suffering devastating casualties  the British panicked and retreated in disarray  however  Washington rode back and forth across the battlefield  rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat  In the process  despite his lingering illness  he demonstrated much bravery and staminahe had two horses shot from underneath him  while his coat was pierced with four bullets  In his report  Washington chiefly blamed the disaster on the conduct of the redcoats while praising that of the Virginia contingent  Whatever responsibility rested on him for the defeat as a result of his recommendation to Braddock  Washington was not included by the succeeding commander  Col  Thomas Dunbar  in planning subsequent force movements     Lt  Governor Dinwiddie rewarded Washington in 1755 with a commission as  Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of all forces now raised in the defense of His Majesty s Colony  and gave him the task of defending Virginia s frontier  The Virginia Regiment was the first full time American military unit in the colonies  as opposed to part time militias and the British regular units   Washington was ordered to  act defensively or offensively  as he thought best    While Washington happily accepted the commission  the coveted redcoat of a British officer as well as the accompanying pay continued to elude him  Dinwiddie as well pressed in vain for the British military to incorporate the Virginia regiment into its ranks     In command of a thousand soldiers  Washington was a disciplinarian who emphasized training  He led his men in brutal campaigns against the Indians in the west  in 10 months his regiment fought 20 battles  and lost a third of its men  Washington s strenuous efforts meant that Virginia s frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies  Ellis concludes  it was his only unqualified success  in the war       In 1758  Washington participated in the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne  He was embarrassed by a friendly fire episode in which his unit and another British unit thought the other was the French enemy and opened fire  with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap  Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition  and the British scored a major strategic victory  gaining control of the Ohio Valley  when the French abandoned the fort  Following the expedition  he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758  Washington did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775     Although Washington never gained the commission in the British army he yearned for  in these years the young man gained valuable military  political  and leadership skills      He closely observed British military tactics  gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution  Washington learned to organize  train  drill  and discipline his companies and regiments  From his observations  readings and conversations with professional officers  he learned the basics of battlefield tactics  as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics    He gained an understanding of overall strategy  especially in locating strategic geographical points     He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations  including disasters and retreats  He developed a command presencegiven his size  strength  stamina  and bravery in battle  he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question      However Washington s fortitude in his early years was sometimes manifested in less constructive ways  Biographer John R  Alden contends Washington offered  fulsome and insincere flattery to British generals in vain attempts to win great favor  and on occasion showed youthful arrogance  as well as jealousy and ingratitude in the midst of impatience     Historian Ron Chernow is of the opinion that his frustrations in dealing with government officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results    other historians tend to ascribe Washington s position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service    Note 3   He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia  who seemed too unreliable  too undisciplined  and too short term compared to regulars    On the other hand  his experience was limited to command of at most 1000 men  and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the Revolution at Boston  New York  Trenton and Philadelphia     On January 6  1759  Washington married the wealthy widow Martha Dandridge Custis   then 28 years old  Surviving letters suggest that he may have been in love at the time with Sally Fairfax   the wife of a friend    Nevertheless  George and Martha made a compatible marriage  because Martha was intelligent  gracious  and experienced in managing a planter s estate     Together the two raised her two children from her previous marriage  John Parke Custis and Martha Parke Custis  later the Washingtons raised two of Mrs  Washington s grandchildren  Eleanor Parke Custis and George Washington Parke Custis   George and Martha never had any children togetherhis earlier bout with smallpox in 1751 may have made him sterile       The newlywed couple moved to Mount Vernon  near Alexandria  where he took up the life of a planter and political figure   Washington s marriage to Martha greatly increased his property holdings and social standing  and made him one of Virginia s wealthiest men  He acquired one third of the 18 000 acre  73km 2   Custis estate upon his marriage  worth approximately  100 000  and managed the remainder on behalf of Martha s children  for whom he sincerely cared     In 1754  Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie had promised land bounties to the soldiers and officers who volunteered to serve during the French and Indian War    Lord Botetourt   the new governor  finally fulfilled Dinwiddie s promise in 17691770      with Washington subsequently receiving title to 23 200 acres  94km 2   where the Kanawha River flows into the Ohio River  in what is now western West Virginia    He also frequently bought additional land in his own name  By 1775  Washington had doubled the size of Mount Vernon to 6 500 acres  26km 2    and had increased its slave population to over 100  As a respected military hero and large landowner  he held local office and was elected to the Virginia provincial legislature  representing Frederick County in the House of Burgesses for seven years  beginning in 1758      Note 4    Washington lived an aristocratic lifestylefox hunting was a favorite leisure activity    He also enjoyed going to dances and parties  in addition to the theater  races  and cockfights   Washington also was known to play cards  backgammon   and billiards     Like most Virginia planters  he imported luxuries and other goods from England and paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop     Washington began to pull himself out of debt in the mid 1760s by diversifying his previously tobacco centric business interests into other ventures   and paying more attention to his affairs    In 1766  he started switching Mount Vernon s primary cash crop away from tobacco to wheat  a crop that could be processed and then sold in various forms in the colonies  and further diversified operations to include flour milling  fishing  horse breeding  spinning  weaving and  in the 1790s  whiskey production    Patsy Custis s death in 1773 from epilepsy enabled Washington to pay off his British creditors  since half of her inheritance passed to him     A successful planter  he was a leader in the social elite in Virginia  From 1768 to 1775  he invited some 2000 guests to his Mount Vernon estate  mostly those he considered  people of rank   As for people not of high social status  his advice was to  treat them civilly  but  keep them at a proper distance  for they will grow upon familiarity  in proportion as you sink in authority     In 1769  he became more politically active  presenting the Virginia Assembly with legislation to ban the importation of goods from Great Britain     Washington opposed the 1765 Stamp Act   the first direct tax on the colonies imposed by the English Parliament which included no representatives from the colonies  he began taking a leading role in the growing colonial resistance when protests against the Townshend Acts  enacted in 1767  became widespread  In May 1769  Washington introduced a proposal  drafted by his friend George Mason   calling for Virginia to boycott English goods until the Acts were repealed    Parliament repealed the Townshend Acts in 1770  However  Washington regarded the passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as  an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges     Washington told friend Bryan Fairfax   I think the Parliament of Great Britain has no more right to put their hands in my pocket without my consent than I have to put my hands into yours for money   He also said that Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny  till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves  as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway      In July 1774  he chaired the meeting at which the   Fairfax Resolves   were adopted  which called for the convening of a Continental Congress   among other things  In August  Washington attended the First Virginia Convention   where he was selected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress        After the Battles of Lexington and Concord near Boston in April 1775  the colonies went to war  Washington appeared at the Second Continental Congress in a military uniform  signaling that he was prepared for war    Washington had the prestige  military experience  charisma and military bearing of a military leader and was known as a strong patriot  Virginia  the largest colony  deserved recognition  and New Englandwhere the fighting beganrealized it needed Southern support  Washington did not explicitly seek the office of commander and said that he was not equal to it      but there was no serious competition    Congress created the Continental Army on June 14  1775    Nominated by John Adams of Massachusetts  Washington was then appointed as a full General and Commander in chief         The British then articulated the peril of Washington and his armyon August 23  1775 Britain issued a Royal proclamation labeling American rebels as traitors  if they resorted to force  they faced confiscation of their property  Their leaders were subject to execution upon the scaffold     General Washington essentially assumed three roles during the war  First  in 177577  and again in 1781 he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces  Although he lost many of his battles  he never surrendered his army during the war  and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war s end  He plotted the overall strategy of the war  in cooperation with Congress     Secondly  he was charged with organizing and training the army  He recruited regulars and assigned Baron von Steuben   a veteran of the Prussian general staff  to train them  The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress    but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials    In June 1776  Congress  first attempt at running the war effort was established with the committee known as  Board of War and Ordnance   succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777  a committee which eventually included members of the military    The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees  and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington s input  with state appointments filling the lower ranks and of all of the militia officers  The results of his general staff were mixed  as some of his favorites  like John Sullivan   never mastered the art of command     Eventually  he found capable officers  such as General Nathanael Greene   General Daniel Morgan    the old wagoner  that he had served with in The French and Indian War   Colonel Henry Knox   chief of artillery  and Colonel Alexander Hamilton   chief of staff  The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver  and consequently they lost most of the pitched battles  The great successes  at Boston  1776   Saratoga  1777  and Yorktown  1781   came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops    Daniel Morgan  s annihilation of Banastre Tarleton  s legion of dragoons at Cowpens in February 1781  came as a result of Morgan s employment of superior line tactics against his British opponent  resulting in one of the very few double envelopments in military history  another being Hannibal  s defeat of the Romans at Cannae in 216 b c  The decisive defeat of Col  Patrick Ferguson  s Tory Regiment at King s Mountain demonstrated the superiority of the riflery of American  over mountain men  over British trained troops armed with musket and bayonet  These  over mountain men  were led by a variety of elected officers  including the 6 6  William Campbell who had become one of Washington s officers by the time of Yorktown  Similarly  Morgan s Virginia riflemen proved themselves superior to the British at Saratoga  a post revolutionary war development being the creation of trained  rifle battalions  in the European armies   Washington s third  and most important role in the war effort  was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crownthe representative man of the Revolution  His long term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times  and eventually this strategy worked  His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress  the army  the French  the militias  and the states all pointed toward a common goal  Furthermore  by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won  rather than declaring himself monarch   he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs  Yet his constant reiteration of the point that well disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as erratic militias  clearly demonstrated in the rout at Camden   where only the Maryland and Delaware Continentals under Baron DeKalb held firm   helped overcome the ideological distrust of a standing army     Washington assumed command of the Continental Army in the field at Cambridge  Massachusetts  in July 1775  during the ongoing siege of Boston   Realizing his army s desperate shortage of gunpowder  Washington asked for new sources  American troops raided British arsenals  including some in the Caribbean   and some manufacturing was attempted  They obtained a barely adequate supply  about 2 5million pounds  by the end of 1776  mostly from France     Washington reorganized the army during the long standoff  and forced the British to withdraw by putting artillery on Dorchester Heights overlooking the city  The British evacuated Boston in March 1776 and Washington moved his army to New York City     Although highly disparaging toward most of the Patriots  British newspapers routinely praised Washington s personal character and qualities as a military commander  These articles were bold  as Washington was an enemy general who commanded an army in a cause that many Britons believed would ruin the empire      In August 1776  British General William Howe launched a massive naval and land campaign designed to seize New York  The Continental Army under Washington engaged the enemy for the first time as an army of the newly independent United States at the Battle of Long Island   the largest battle of the entire war  The Americans were heavily outnumbered  many men deserted  and Washington was badly beaten  Subsequently  Washington was forced to retreat across the East River at night  He did so without loss of life or materiel    Washington  heeding Greene s recommendation to attempt a defense of Ft  Washington  belatedly retreated further across the Hudson to Ft  Lee  to avoid encirclement  but thereby enabled Howe to take the offensive and capture Fort Washington on November 16 with high Continental casualties  Biographer Alden opines that  although Washington was responsible for the decision to delay the patriots  retreat  he tried to ascribe blame for the decision to defend Fort Washington to the wishes of Congress and the bad advice of Nathaniel Greene      Washington then continued his flight across New Jersey  the future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to expiring enlistments and the string of losses    On the night of December 25  1776  Washington staged a comeback with a surprise attack on a Hessian outpost in western New Jersey   He led his army across the Delaware River to capture nearly 1 000 Hessians in Trenton  New Jersey  Washington followed up his victory at Trenton with another over British regulars at Princeton in early January  The British retreated to New York City and its environs  which they held until the peace treaty of 1783  Washington s victories wrecked the British carrot and stick strategy of showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms  The Americans would not negotiate for anything short of independence    These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory  however  since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter  Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion  which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles     In February 1777  while encamped at Morristown  New Jersey Washington became convinced that only smallpox inoculation would prevent the destruction of his Army  by using variolation   Washington ordered the inoculation of all troops and by some reports  death by smallpox in the ranks dropped from 17  of all deaths to 1  of all reported deaths     47  Historians debate whether or not Washington preferred a Fabian strategy   Note 5   to harass the British with quick  sharp attacks followed by a retreat so the larger British army could not catch him  or whether he preferred to fight major battles    Note 6   While his southern commander Greene in 178081 did use Fabian tactics  Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777  after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away  Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples  By summer 1777  however  Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence  he stopped using raids and went for large scale confrontations  as at Brandywine  Germantown  Monmouth and Yorktown     In late summer of 1777  British General John Burgoyne led a major invasion army south from Quebec  with the intention of splitting off rebellious New England  but General Howe in New York took his army south to Philadelphia instead of going up the Hudson River to join with Burgoyne near Albanya major strategic mistake  Meanwhile  Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe  while closely following the action in upstate New York  where the patriots were led by General Philip Schuyler and his successor Horatio Gates   The ensuing pitched battles at Philadelphia were too complex for Washington s relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated  At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11  1777  Howe outmaneuvered Washington  and marched into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26  Washington s army unsuccessfully attacked the British garrison at Germantown in early October  Meanwhile to the north  Burgoyne  beyond the reach of help from Howe  was trapped and forced to surrender after the Battles of Saratoga     This was a major turning point militarily and diplomaticallythe French responded to Burgoyne s defeat by entering the war  allying with America and expanding the Revolutionary War into a major worldwide affair   Washington s loss at Philadelphia prompted some members of Congress to consider removing Washington from command  This movement  termed the Conway Cabal   failed after Washington s supporters rallied behind him    Biographer Alden relates   it was inevitable that the defeats of Washington s forces and the concurrent victory of the forces in upper New York should be compared   The zealous admiration of Washington indeed inevitably waned  John Adams  never a fan of the southern delegation to the Continental Congress  wrote  Congress will appoint a thanksgiving  and one cause of it ought to be that the glory of turning the tide of arms is not immediately due to the commander in chief nor to southern troops  If it had been  idolatry and adulation would have been unbounded   Now we can allow a certain citizen to be wise  virtuous  and good  without thinking him a deity or a savior      Washington s army of 11 000   went into winter quarters at Valley Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777  Over the next six months  the deaths in camp numbered in the thousands  the majority being from disease     with historians  death toll estimates ranging from 2000   to 2500      to over 3000 men    The next spring  however  the army emerged from Valley Forge in good order  thanks in part to a full scale training program supervised by General von Steuben    The British evacuated Philadelphia to New York in 1778    shadowed by Washington  Washington attacked them at Monmouth   fighting to an effective draw in one of the war s largest battles    Afterwards  the British continued to head towards New York  and Washington moved his army outside of New York     In the summer of 1779 Washington and Congress decided to strike the Iroquois warriors of the  Six Nations  in a campaign to force Britain s Indian allies out of New York  which they had used as a base to attack American settlements across New England    In June 1779  the warriors had joined with Tory rangers led by Colonel William Butler  using barbarities normally shunned  slew over 200 frontiersmen and laid waste to the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania  Indeed  one British officer who witnessed the Tory brutality said the redcoats on return to England would  scalp every son of a bitch of them     In August of 1779 General John Sullivan led a military operation that destroyed at least 40 Iroquois villages  burned all available crops  Few people were killed as the Indians fled to British protection in Canada  Sullivan later reported that the immediate objects of this expedition are accomplished  viz  total ruin of the Indian settlements and the destruction of their crops  which were designed for the support of those inhuman barbarians      Washington at this time moved his headquarters from Middlebrook to New Windsor on the Hudson  with an army of 10 000  The British  led by Howe s successor  Sir Henry Clinton made a move up the Hudson against American posts at Verplanck s Point and Stony Point and both places succumbed  but a counter offensive by the patriots led by General Anthony Wayne was briefly successful  Clinton was in the end able to shut off Kings Ferry but it was a strategic loss   he could proceed no further up the river  due to American fortifications and Washington s army  The skirmishes at Verplanck s Point and at Stony Point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous boost to morale     The winter of 17791780  when Washington went into quarters at Morristown  represented the worst suffering for the army during the war  The temperatures fell to 16 below zero  the New York Harbor was frozen over  and snow and ice covered the ground for weeks  with the troops again lacking provisions for a time as at Valley Forge    In late 1779 Clinton moved his forces south to Charleston for an offensive against the patriots  led by Benjamin Lincoln  After his success there Clinton returned victorious to New York  leaving Cornwallis in the south  Congress replaced Lincoln with Gates  despite Washington s recommendation of Greene  When Gates failed in South Carolina  he was then replaced by Greene  The British at the time seemed to have the South almost in their grasp  Despite this news  Washington was encouraged to learn in mid 1780 that Lafayette had returned from France with additional naval assets and forces     Washington was shocked to learn of the treason of Benedict Arnold  who had contributed significantly to the war effort  Embittered by his dealings with Congress over rank and finances  as well as the alliance with France  Arnold joined the British cause  he conspired with the British in a plan to seize the post he commanded at West Point  Washington just missed apprehending him  but did capture his conspirator  Major John Andre  a British intelligence officer under Clinton  who was later hanged by order of a court martial called by Washington     Washington s army went into winter quarters at New Windsor in 1780 and suffered again for lack of supplies  There resulted a considerable mutiny by Pennsylvania troops  Washington prevailed upon Congress as well as state officials to come to their aid with provisions  He very much sympathized with their suffering  saying he hoped the army would  continue to struggle under the same difficulties they have hitherto endured  which I cannot help remarking seem to reach the bounds of human patience      In July 1780  5 000 veteran French troops led by the comte de Rochambeau arrived at Newport  Rhode Island to aid in the war effort    French naval forces then landed  led by Admiral Franois Joseph Paul de Grasse   Though it was Washington s hope initially to bring the allied fight to New York and to end the war there  de Grasse was advised by Rochambeau that Cornwallis in Virginia was the better target  de Grasse followed Rochambeau s advice and arrived off the Virginia Coast  Washington immediately saw the advantage created  made a feinting move with his force towards Clinton in New York and then headed south to Virginia     Washington s Continental Army  also newly funded by  20 000 in French gold  delivered the final blow to the British in 1781  after a French naval victory allowed American and French forces to trap a British army in Virginia  preventing reinforcement by Clinton from the North    The surrender at Yorktown on October 19  1781  marked the end of major fighting in continental North America    Cornwallis failed to appear at the official surrender ceremony  and sent General Charles Oharrow as his proxy  Washington then assigned his role to Benjamin Lincoln of equal rank     Though substantial combat had ended  the war had not  and a formal treaty of peace was months away  creating tension  The British still had 26 000 troops occupying New York City  Charleston and Savannah  together with a powerful fleet  The French army and navy departed  so the Americans were on their own in 178283  Money matters fed the anxietythe treasury was empty  and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive  almost to the point of mutiny  At one point the mutineers forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton  Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783  and Congress came up with the promise of a five year bonus     With the initial peace treaty articles ratified in April  a recently formed Congressional committee under Hamilton was considering needs and plans for a peacetime army  On May 2  1783  the Commander in Chief submitted his Sentiments on a Peace Establishment   to the Committee  essentially providing an official Continental Army position  The original proposal was defeated in Congress in two votes  May 1783  October 1783  with a truncated version also being rejected in April 1784     By the Treaty of Paris  signed that September   Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States  Washington disbanded his army and  on November 2  gave an eloquent farewell address to his soldiers    On November 25  the British evacuated New York City   and Washington and the governor took possession  At Fraunces Tavern on December 4  Washington formally bade his officers farewell and on December 23  1783  he resigned his commission as commander in chief  saying  I consider it an indispensable duty to close this last solemn act of my official life  by commending the interests of our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God  and those who have the superintendence of them  to his holy keeping     Historian Gordon Wood concludes that the greatest act in his life was his resignation as commander of the armiesan act that stunned aristocratic Europe    King George III called Washington  the greatest character of the age  because of this     Washington later submitted a formal account of the expenses he had personally advanced the army over the eight year conflict  of about  450 000  It is said to have been detailed regarding small items  vague concerning large ones and included the expenses incurred from Martha s visits to his headquarters  as well as his compensation for service  none of which had been drawn during the war     Historian John Shy says that by 1783 Washington was  a mediocre military strategist but had become a master political tactician with an almost perfect sense of timing and a developed capacity to exploit his charismatic reputation  using people who thought they were using him      Washington s retirement to personal business at Mount Vernon was short lived  Making an exploratory trip to the western frontier in 1784  he inspected his land holdings in Western Pennsylvania that had been earned decades earlier for his service in the French and Indian War      There  he confronted squatters  including David Reed and the Covenanters  who vacated  but only after losing a court decision heard in Washington  Pennsylvania in 1786     After much reluctance  he was persuaded to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787 as a delegate from Virginia  where he was elected in unanimity as president of the Convention    He held considerable criticism of the Articles of Confederation of the thirteen colonies  for the weak central government it established  referring to the Articles as no more than  a rope of sand  to support the new nation    His participation in the debates was minor  although he casted his vote when called upon  his prestige facilitated the collegiality and productivity of the delegates  After a couple of months into the task  Washington told Alexander Hamilton   I almost despair of seeing a favorable issue to the proceedings of our convention and do therefore repent having had any agency in the business   In the end agreements were hatched however  and Washington thought the achievement monumental     Following the Convention  his support convinced many  but not all of his colleagues  to vote for ratification  He unsuccessfully lobbied Patrick Henry  saying that  the adoption of it under the present circumstances of the union is in my opinion desirable   he declared that the only alternative would be anarchy  Nevertheless  he did not consider it appropriate to cast his vote in favor of adoption for Virginia  since he was expected to be nominated president thereunder    The new Constitution was subsequently ratified by all thirteen states    The delegates to the convention designed the presidency with Washington in mind  allowing him to define the office by establishing precedent once elected     The Electoral College unanimously elected Washington as the first president in 1789     Note 7   and again 1792     He remains the only president to receive the totality of electoral votes    Note 8   John Adams   who received the next highest vote total  was elected Vice President  On April 30  1789 Washington was inaugurated   taking the first presidential oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City    The oath  as follows  was administered by Chancellor Robert R  Livingston   I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States  and will to the best of my ability  preserve  protect and defend the Constitution of the United States  Historian John R  Alden indicates that Washington added the words  So help me God      The 1st United States Congress voted to pay Washington a salary of  25 000 a yeara large sum in 1789  valued at about  340 000 in 2015 dollars    Note 9   Washington  despite facing financial troubles then  initially declined the salary  valuing his image as a selfless public servant  At the urging of Congress  however  he ultimately accepted the payment  to avoid setting a precedent whereby the presidency would be perceived as limited only to independently wealthy individuals who could serve without any salary    The President  aware that everything he did set a precedent  attended carefully to the pomp and ceremony of office  making sure that the titles and trappings were suitably republican and never emulated European royal courts    Note 10     To that end  he preferred the title   Mr  President   to the more majestic names proposed by the Senate     Washington proved an able administrator  and established many precedents in the functions of the presidency  including messages to Congress and the cabinet form of government    Despite fears that a democratic system would lead to political violence  he set the standard for tolerance of opposition voices and conducted a smooth transition of power to his successor    An excellent delegator and judge of talent and character  he talked regularly with department heads and listened to their advice before making a final decision    In handling routine tasks  he was  systematic  orderly  energetic  solicitous of the opinion of others     but decisive  intent upon general goals and the consistency of particular actions with them     After reluctantly serving a second term  Washington refused to run for a third  establishing the tradition of a maximum of two terms for a president  which was solidified by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison     Washington was not a member of any political party and hoped that they would not be formed  fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism    His closest advisors formed two factions  setting the framework for the future First Party System   Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and build a financially powerful nation  and formed the basis of the Federalist Party   Secretary of the State Thomas Jefferson  founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans   strenuously opposed Hamilton s agenda  but Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson  and it was Hamilton s agenda that went into effect  Jefferson s political actions  his support of Philip Freneau  s National Gazette     and his attempt to undermine Hamilton  nearly led George Washington to dismiss Jefferson from his cabinet    Though Jefferson left the cabinet voluntarily  Washington never forgave him  and never spoke to him again     In early 1790 Hamilton devised a plan with the approval of Washington  culminating in The Residence Act of 1790   that established the creditworthiness of the new government  as well as its permanent location  Congress had previously issued almost  22 million in certificates of debt during the war to suppliers  some of the states had incurred debt as well  more so in the north   In accordance with the plan  Congress authorized the  assumption  and payment of these debts  and provided funding through customs duties and excise taxes  The proposal was largely favored in the north and opposed in the south  Hamilton obtained the approval of the southern states in exchange for an agreement to place the new national capitol on the Potomac River  While the national debt increased as a result during Hamilton s service as Secretary of the Treasury  the nation established its good credit  Many in the Congress and elsewhere in the government profited from trading in the debt paper which was assumed  Though many of Washington s fellow Virginians  as well as others  were vexed by this  he considered they had adequate redress through their Congressional representatives     The Revenue Act authorized the President to select the specific location of the seat of the government on the Potomac  the President was to appoint three commissioners to survey and acquire property for this seat  Washington personally oversaw this effort throughout his term in office  In 1791  the commissioners named the permanent seat of government  The City of Washington in the Territory of Columbia  to honor Washington  In 1800  the Territory of Columbia became the District of Columbia when the federal government moved to the site according to the provisions of the Residence Act     In 1791  partly as a result of the Copper Panic of 1789   Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits  which led to protests in frontier districts  especially Pennsylvania  By 1794  after Washington ordered the protesters to appear in U S  district court   the protests turned into full scale defiance of federal authority known as the Whiskey Rebellion   The federal army was too small to be used  so Washington invoked the Militia Act of 1792 to summon militias from Pennsylvania  Virginia  Maryland and New Jersey    The governors sent the troops  with Washington taking initial command  He subsequently named Henry  Lighthorse Harry  Lee as field commander to lead the troops into the rebellious districts  The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting  as Washington s forceful action proved the new government could protect itself  This represented the premier instance of the federal government using military force to exert authority over the states and citizens   and is also the only time a sitting U S  president personally commanded troops in the field     In February 1793 the French Revolutionary Wars broke out between Great Britain and its allies and revolutionary France  and engulfed Europe until 1815  Washington  with cabinet approval  proclaimed American neutrality  The revolutionary government of France sent diplomat Edmond Charles Gent   called  Citizen Gent   to America  Gent was welcomed with great enthusiasm  and began promoting the case for France using a network of new Democratic Societies in major cities  He even issued French letters of marque and reprisal to French ships manned by American sailors so they could capture British merchant ships  Washington denounced the societies and demanded the French government recall Gent  which they did     Hamilton formulated the Jay Treaty to normalize trade relations with Great Britain  remove them from western forts  and resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution    John Jay negotiated and signed the treaty on November 19  1794  Jeffersonians supported France and strongly attacked the treaty  Washington listened to both sides then announced his strong support  which mobilized public opinion and was pivotal in securing ratification in the Senate by the requisite two thirds majority    The British agreed to depart from their forts around the Great Lakes and the United States Canadian boundary had to be re adjusted  numerous pre Revolutionary debts were liquidated  and the British opened their West Indies colonies to American trade  Most importantly  the treaty delayed war with Great Britain and instead brought a decade of prosperous trade with the British  The treaty angered the French and became a central issue in many political debates    Relations with France deteriorated after the treaty was signed  leaving the succeeding president  John Adams  with the prospect of war       Washington s Farewell Address  issued as a public letter in 1796  was one of the most influential statements of republicanism  Drafted primarily by Washington himself  with help from Hamilton  it gives advice on the necessity and importance of national union  the value of the Constitution and the rule of law  the evils of political parties and the proper virtues of a republican people  He referred to morality as  a necessary spring of popular government    and said   Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure  reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle      The address warned against foreign influence in domestic affairs and American meddling in European affairs  and as well against bitter partisanship in domestic politics  he also called for men to move beyond partisanship and serve the common good  He cautioned against  permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world     saying the United States must concentrate primarily on American interests  He counseled friendship and commerce with all nations  but advised against involvement in European wars and entering into long term  entangling  alliances  The address quickly set American values regarding foreign affairs     After retiring from the presidency in March 1797  Washington returned to Mount Vernon with a profound sense of relief  He devoted much time to his plantations and other business interests  including his distillery which produced its first batch of spirits in February 1797    As Chernow  2010   explains  his plantation operations were only minimally profitable  The lands out west yielded little income because they were under attack by Indians and the squatters living there refused to pay him rent  Most Americans assumed he was rich because of the well known  glorified faade of wealth and grandeur  at Mount Vernon    Historians estimate his estate was worth about  1million in 1799 dollars  equivalent to about  19 3million in 2012 purchasing power     By 1798  relations with France had deteriorated to the point that war seemed imminent  and on July 4  1798  President Adams offered Washington a commission as lieutenant general and Commander in chief of the armies raised or to be raised for service in a prospective war   He accepted  and served as the senior officer of the United States Army from July 13  1798 until his death seventeen months later  He participated in the planning for a Provisional Army to meet any emergency that might arise  but avoided involvement in details as much as possible  he delegated most of the work  including leadership of the army  to Hamilton       During the Revolutionary and Early Republican periods of American history  many commentators compared Washington with the Roman aristocrat and statesman Cincinnatus   The comparison arose as Washington  like Cincinnatus  remained in command of the Continental Army only until the British had been defeated  Thereafter  instead of seeking great political power  he returned as quickly as possible to cultivating his lands      Remarking on Washington s resignation in December 1783  and his decision to retire to Mount Vernon  poet Philip Freneau wrote  Thus He  whom Rome s proud legions sway d Return d  and sought his sylvan shade    Lord Byron  s Ode to Napoleon also lionized Washington as  the Cincinnatus of the West      On Thursday  December 12  1799  Washington spent several hours inspecting his plantation on horseback  in snow  hail  and freezing rain  later that evening he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes    That Friday he awoke with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed  yet still rode out in the heavy snow  marking trees on the estate that he wanted cut  Sometime around 3a m  that Saturday  he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow    A firm believer in bloodletting   a standard medical practice of that era which he had used to treat various ailments of enslaved Africans on his plantation  he ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove half a pint of his blood   A total of three physicians were sent for  including Washington s personal physician Dr  James Craik   along with Dr  Gustavus Brown and Dr  Elisha Dick   Craik and Brown thought that Washington had   quinsey   or  quincy   while Dick  the younger man  thought the condition was more serious or a  violent inflammation of the throat     By the time the three physicians finished their treatments and bloodletting of the President  there had been a massive volume of blood losshalf or more of his total blood content was removed over the course of just a few hours        Recognizing that the bloodletting and other treatments were failing  Dr  Dick proposed performing an emergency tracheotomy   a procedure that few American physicians were familiar with at the time  as a last ditch effort to save Washington s life  but the other two doctors disapproved       Washington died at home around 10p m  on Saturday  December 14  1799  aged 67  In his journal  Lear recorded Washington s last words as being   Tis well      The diagnosis of Washington s final illness and the immediate cause of his death have been subjects of debate since the day he died        In the days immediately following his death  Craik and Dick s published account stated that they felt his symptoms had been consistent with   cynanche trachealis    a term of that period used to describe severe inflammation of the structures of the upper airway        Even at that early date  there were accusations of medical malpractice  with some believing that Washington had been bled to death      Various modern medical authors have speculated that Washington probably died from a severe case of epiglottitis which was complicated by the given treatments  all of which were accepted medical practice in Washington s day most notably the massive deliberate blood loss  which almost certainly caused hypovolemic shock     Note 11    Throughout the world  men and women were saddened by Washington s death  In France  First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte ordered ten days of mourning throughout the country  in the United States  memorial processions were held in major cities and thousands wore mourning clothes for months      To protect their privacy  Martha Washington burned the correspondence they had exchanged  only five letters between the couple are known to have survived  two letters from Martha to George and three from him to Martha       On December 18  1799  a funeral was held at Mount Vernon  where his body was interred    Congress passed a joint resolution to construct a marble monument in the planned crypt below the rotunda of the center section of the Capitol  then still under construction  for his body  a plan supported by Martha  In December 1800  the House passed an appropriations bill for  200 000 to build the mausoleum  which was to be a pyramid with a 100 foot  30m  square base  Southern representatives and senators  in later opposition to the plan  defeated the measure because they felt it was best to have Washington s body remain at Mount Vernon     In 1831  for the centennial of his birth  a new tomb was constructed to receive his remains  That year  an unsuccessful attempt was made to steal the body of Washington    Despite this  a joint Congressional committee in early 1832  debated the removal of President Washington s body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol  built by architect Charles Bulfinch in the 1820s during the reconstruction of the burned out structure after the British set it afire in August 1814  during the   Burning of Washington    Southern opposition was intense  antagonized by an ever growing rift between North and South  Congressman Wiley Thompson of Georgia expressed the fear of Southerners when he said   Remove the remains of our venerated Washington from their association with the remains of his consort and his ancestors  from Mount Vernon and from his native State  and deposit them in this capitol  and then let a severance of the Union occur  and behold the remains of Washington on a shore foreign to his native soil      His remains were moved on October 7  1837 to the new tomb constructed at Mount Vernon  presented by John Struthers of Philadelphia     After the ceremony  the inner vault s door was closed and the key was thrown into the Potomac      As Commander in Chief of the Continental Army  hero of the revolution and the first president of the United States  George Washington s legacy remains among the greatest in American history    Note 12   Congressman Henry  Light Horse Harry  Lee   a Revolutionary War comrade  famously eulogized Washington      First in warfirst in peaceand first in the hearts of his countrymen  he was second to none in the humble and enduring scenes of private life  pious  just  humane  temperate  and sincere  uniform  dignified  and commanding  his example was as edifying to all around him as were the effects of that example lasting  To his equals he was condescending  to his inferiors kind  and to the dear object of his affections exemplarily tender  correct throughout  vice shuddered in his presence  and virtue always felt his fostering hand  the purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues  His last scene comported with the whole tenor of his lifealthough in extreme pain  not a sigh  not a groan escaped him  and with undisturbed serenity he closed his well spent life  Such was the man America has lostsuch was the man for whom our nation mourns   Lee s words set the standard by which Washington s overwhelming reputation was impressed upon the American memory  Washington set many precedents for the national government  and the presidency in particular  and was called the   Father of His Country   as early as 1778    Note 13         Washington s Birthday  celebrated on Presidents  Day   is a federal holiday in the United States     After Yorktown  his service as Commander in Chief brought him election as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences      The Federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years  the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the Washington Monument   As the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history  Washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism     During the United States Bicentennial year  George Washington was posthumously appointed to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States by the congressional joint resolution Public Law 94 479 passed on January 19  1976  with an effective appointment date of July 4  1976    This restored Washington s position as the highest ranking military officer in U S  history     Note 14    Perhaps the best known story about Washington s childhood is that he chopped down his father s favorite cherry tree and admitted the deed when questioned   I can t tell a lie  Pa   The anecdote was first reported by biographer Parson Weems   who after Washington s death interviewed people who knew him as a child over a half century earlier  The Weems text was very widely reprinted throughout the 19th century  for example in McGuffey Readers  Adults wanted children to learn moral lessons from history  especially as taught by example from the lives of great national heroes like Washington  After 1890 however  historians insisted on scientific research methods to validate every statement  and there was no documentation for this anecdote apart from Weems  report that he learned it in an interview with an old person  Joseph Rodman in 1904 noted that Weems plagiarized other Washington tales from published fiction set in England  but no one has found an alternative source for the cherry tree story       Starting with victory in their Revolution  there were many proposals to build a monument to Washington  After his death  Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the national capital  but the decision was reversed when the Republicans took control of Congress in 1801  The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become the symbol of the Federalist Party  furthermore  the values of Republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men    Further political squabbling  along with the North South division on the Civil War  blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century  By that time  Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South  and memorials to him were no longer controversial    Predating the obelisk on the National Mall by several decades  the first public memorial to Washington was built by the citizens of Boonsboro  Maryland   in 1827     Today  Washington s face and image are often used as national symbols of the United States    He appears on contemporary currency  including the one dollar bill and the quarter coin   and on U S  postage stamps   Along with appearing on the first postage stamps issued by the U S  Post Office in 1847    Washington  together with Theodore Roosevelt   Thomas Jefferson  and Lincoln  is depicted in stone at the Mount Rushmore Memorial   The Washington Monument   one of the best known American landmarks  was built in his honor  The George Washington Masonic National Memorial in Alexandria  Virginia  was constructed between 1922 and 1932 with voluntary contributions from all 52 local governing bodies of the Freemasons in the United States       Many places and entities have been named in honor of Washington   Washington s name became that of the nation s capital  Washington  D C   one of two national capitals across the globe to be named after an American president  the other is Monrovia   Liberia   The state of Washington is the only state to be named after a United States President    George Washington University and Washington University in St  Louis were named for him  as was Washington and Lee University  once Washington Academy   which was renamed due to Washington s large endowment in 1796  Washington College in Chestertown  Maryland  established by Maryland state charter in 1782  was supported by Washington during his lifetime with a 50 guineas pledge    and with service on the college s Board of Visitors and Governors until 1789  when Washington was elected President     According to the US Census Bureau s 1993 geographic data  Washington is the 17th most common street name in the United States    and the only person s name so honored    Note 15    There are many  Washington Monuments  in the United States  including two well known equestrian statues  one in Manhattan and one in Richmond  Virginia  The first statue to show Washington on horseback was dedicated in 1856 and is located in Manhattan s Union Square    The second statue is known as either the Virginia Washington Monument or as the George Washington Equestrian Statue   and was unveiled in 1858      It was the second American statue of Washington on horseback   but figures prominently in the official seal of the Confederate States of America       A marble statue of Washington was made from life by sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon   and now sits in the Rotunda of the State Capitol in Richmond  Virginia  A duplicate  one of 22 bronze exact replicas    was given to the British in 1921 by the Commonwealth of Virginia and now stands in front of the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square      In 1917  the 886 Washingtonia asteroid was named in his honor   The first Washington Monument   in Baltimore   Maryland  Washington Monument in Washington  D C   National Masonic Memorial in Alexandria  Virginia   the second

of the United States and a draft of the Bill of Rights   was sold at Christie s for a record  9 826 500  with fees the final cost  to The Mount Vernon Ladies  Association   This was the record for a document sold at auction     Along with Martha s biological family  George Washington had a close relationship with his nephew and heir  Bushrod Washington   son of George s younger brother  John Augustine Washington   The year before his uncle s death  Bushrod became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States   George  however  apparently did not get along well with his mother  Mary Ball Washington  Augustine s second wife   who was a very demanding and difficult person     As a young man  Washington had red hair    A popular myth is that he wore a wig  as was the fashion among some at the time  However  Washington did not wear a wig  instead  he powdered his hair    as is represented in several portraits  including the well known  unfinished Gilbert Stuart depiction called the  Athenaeum Portrait      Washington s height was variously recorded as 6ft  1 83m  to 6ft 2in  1 88m     and he had unusually great physical strength that amazed younger men  Jefferson called Washington  the best horseman of his age   and both American and European observers praised his riding  the horsemanship benefited his hunting  a favorite hobby  Washington was an excellent dancer and frequently attended the theater  often referencing Shakespeare in letters    He drank in moderation and precisely recorded gambling wins and losses  but Washington disliked the excessive drinking  gambling  smoking  and profanity that was common in colonial Virginia  Although he grew tobacco  he eventually stopped smoking  and considered drunkenness a man s worst vice  Washington was glad that post Revolutionary Virginia society was less likely to  force  guests  to drink and to make it an honor to send them home drunk      Washington suffered from problems with his teeth throughout his life  He lost his first adult tooth when he was twenty two and had only one left by the time he became President    John Adams claims he lost them because he used them to crack Brazil nuts but modern historians suggest the mercury oxide   which he was given to treat illnesses such as smallpox and malaria   probably contributed to the loss  He had several sets of false teeth made  four of them by a dentist named John Greenwood    Contrary to popular belief   none of the sets were made from wood  The set made when he became President was carved from hippopotamus and elephant ivory  held together with gold springs    Prior to these  he had a set made with real human teeth    likely ones he purchased from  several unnamed  Negroes   presumably Mount Vernon slaves  in 1784    Dental problems left Washington in constant pain  for which he took laudanum     This distress may be apparent in many of the portraits painted while he was still in office    including the one still used on the  1 bill      Note 16    Washington was the only prominent Founding Father to arrange in his will for the manumission of all his slaves following his death    He privately opposed slavery as an institution which he viewed as economically unsound and morally indefensible  He also regarded the divisiveness of his countrymen s feelings about slavery as a potentially mortal threat to the unity of the nation    Yet  as general of the army  president of the Constitutional Convention  and the first president of the United States  he never publicly challenged the institution of slavery      possibly because he wanted to avoid provoking a split in the new republic over so inflammatory an issue     Washington had owned slaves since the death of his father in 1743  when at the age of eleven  he inherited 10 slaves  At the time of his marriage to Martha Custis in 1759  he personally owned at least 36 slaves  which meant he had achieved the status of a major planter  historians   who    defined this in the Upper South as owning 20 or more slaves   The wealthy widow Martha brought at least 85   dower slaves  to Mount Vernon by inheriting a third of her late husband s estate  Using his wife s great wealth  Washington bought more land  tripling the size of the plantation at Mount Vernon  and purchased the additional slaves needed to work it  By 1774  he paid taxes on 135 slaves  this figure does not include the  dowers    The last record of a slave purchase by him was in 1772  although he later received some slaves in repayment of debts    Washington also used some hired staff   and white indentured servants   in April 1775  he offered a reward for the return of two runaway white servants     Washington came to oppose slavery on both moral and economic grounds  Before the American Revolution  he had expressed no moral reservations about slavery  But by 1779  he would tell his manager at Mount Vernon that he wished to sell his slaves when the war ended  if the Americans were victorious    He concluded that maintaining a large  and increasingly elderly  slave population at Mount Vernon was no longer economically profitable  and that people who were compelled to work would never work hard    Washington could not legally sell the  dower slaves   and because they had long intermarried with his own slaves  he could not sell his slaves without breaking up families  which he wanted to avoid    In 1786  Washington wrote to Robert Morris   saying   There is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do  to see a plan adopted for the abolition of slavery      As president  following the transfer of the national capital to Pennsylvania in 1790  Washington brought eight enslaved people to work for him in the President s House in Philadelphia  where state law would have automatically granted freedom to any slaves who had resided in the state for more than 6 months  He circumvented that provision of the law by maintaining that he was not a Pennsylvania resident and ensuring that neither he nor any of his slaves stayed in the state for more than six months at a time    When one of the slaves  Oney Judge   a personal attendant to Martha  escaped  Washington complained that the slave had fled  without the least provocation   and he secretly sent agents to hunt her down  Washington could not legally free Judge  since she was Martha s dower slave  Martha urged Washington to advertise a reward for her capture  and the ad was placed in the Pennsylvania Gazette on May 24  1796  When the escaped former slave was spotted in New Hampshire  she said that she would agree to return out of affection for the Washington family  but only if they would guarantee her freedom  a proposal the Washingtons refused  They were still trying  surreptitiously  to recapture her two years later      Another slave  Hercules   who served as Washington s chef in the Presidential House in Philadelphia  managed to escape from Mount Vernon despite Washington s suspicions that he had been planning it      Washington would eventually replace the slaves at the President s House with immigrant German indentured servants   By 1794  as he contemplated retirement  Washington began organizing his affairs so that in his will he could free all the slaves he owned outright    As historian Gordon S  Wood writes in his review of Joseph Ellis   biography of Washington   He did this in the teeth of opposition from his relatives  his neighbors  and perhaps even Martha  It was a courageous act  and one of his greatest legacies     At the time of Washington s death in 1799  317 slaves lived at Mount Vernon  123 were owned by Washington himself  154 were held by his wife as  dower slaves   and 40 others were rented from a neighbor    Washington s will provided for all of his slaves to be unconditionally freed upon the death of his widow  his heirs being expressly forbidden from selling or transporting those slaves out of Virginia  Hercules   who had earlier escaped Washington  was freed and no longer a fugitive slave  The will also provided for the training of the younger former slaves in useful skills and for the creation of an old age pension fund for the older ones    George and Martha emancipated no slaves during their lifetimes and when Martha died on May 22  1802  all of the slaves she was legally responsible for were not freed  Her human property Elisha went to her grandson George Washington Custis    the slaves from her first husband s estatethe dower slaves as well as the slaves she held in trustwent to his inheritors     The exact nature of Washington s religious beliefs has been debated by historians and biographers for over two hundred years  For his entire life he was affiliated with the Anglican Church   later called the Episcopal Church   He served as a vestryman and as church warden for both Fairfax Parish in Alexandria and Truro Parish    administrative positions that  like all positions in Virginia while it had an official religion  required one to swear they would not speak or act in a way that did not conform to the tenets of the Church  Numerous historians have suggested that theologically  Washington agreed largely with the Deists  However  he never made a statement one way or the other  He often used words for the deity  such as  God  and  Providence   while avoiding using the words  Jesus  and  Christ   In his collected works  they appear in an official letter to Indians that might have been drafted by an aide  At the time  Deism was a theological outlook  not an organized denomination  and was compatible with being an Episcopalian  Historian Gregg Frazer argues that Washington was not a deist but a   theistic rationalist    This theological position rejected core beliefs of Christianity  such as the divinity of Christ  the Trinity and original sin  However  unlike the deists  the theological rationalists believed in the efficacy of prayer to God    Historian Peter A  Lillback argues that Washington was neither a deist nor a  theistic rationalist  but a Christian who believed in the core beliefs of Christianity     Washington  as commander of the army and as president  was a vigorous promoter of tolerance for all religious denominations  He believed religion was an important support for public order  morality and virtue  He often attended services of different denominations  He suppressed anti Catholic celebrations in the Army     Washington frequently accompanied his wife to church services  Although third hand reports say he took communion     he is usually characterized as never or rarely participating in the rite      He would regularly leave services before communion with the other non communicants  as was the custom of the day   until  after being admonished by a rector   he ceased attending at all on communion Sundays     Chernow  in a 2010 podcast  summed up Washington s religious views   There has been a huge controversy  to put it mildly  about Washington s religious beliefs  Before the Revolutionary War he was AnglicanChurch of Englandwhich meant after the war  he was Episcopalian  So  he was clearly Christian     He was quite intensely religious  because even though he uses the word Providence  he constantly sees Providence as an active force in life  particularly in American life  I mean  every single victory in war he credits to Providence  The miracle of the Constitutional Convention he credits to Providence  The creation of the federal government and the prosperity of the early republic  he credits to Providence     I was struck at how frequently in his letters he s referring to Providence  and it s Providence where there s a sense of design and purpose  which sounds to me very much like religion     Unfortunately  this particular issue has become very very politicized     Michael Novak and Jana Novak suggest that it may have been  Washingtons intention to maintain a studied ambiguity  and personal privacy  regarding his own deepest religious convictions  so that all Americans  both in his own time and for all time to come  might feel free to approach him on their own termsand might also feel like full members of the new republic  equal with every other     They conclude   He was educated in the Episcopal Church  to which he always adhered  and my sic  conviction is  that he believed in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity as usually taught in that Church  according to his understanding of them  but without a particle of intolerance  or disrespect for the faith and modes of worship adopted by Christians of other denominations      Washington was initiated into Freemasonry in 1752    He had a high regard for the Masonic Order and often praised it  but he seldom attended lodge meetings  He was attracted by the movement s dedication to the Enlightenment principles of rationality  reason and fraternalism  the American lodges did not share the anti clerical perspective that made the European lodges so controversial    In 1777  a convention of Virginia lodges recommended Washington to be the Grand Master of the newly established Grand Lodge of Virginia   however  Washington declined  due to his necessity to lead the Continental Army at a critical stage  and because he had never been installed as Master or Warden of a lodge  he did not consider it Masonically legal to serve as Grand Master    In 1788  Washington  with his personal consent  was named Master in the Virginia charter of Alexandria Lodge No  22      George Washington appears on contemporary U S  currency  including the one dollar bill and the quarter dollar coin  the Washington quarter     Washington  along with Benjamin Franklin   appeared on

third President of the United States  18011809   A proponent of democracy  Jefferson embraced the concepts of republicanism and individual rights  During the American Revolution   he represented Virginia in the Continental Congress and later served as a wartime Governor of Virginia  17791781   In May 1785  he became the United States Minister to France and subsequently the first United States Secretary of State from 17901793  serving under President George Washington   Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party led by Alexander Hamilton in the formation of the First Party System   He was elected to the office of Vice President in 1796  the second in history  serving in the administration of President John Adams   Jefferson and Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 17981799  documents intended to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts   the resolutions were passed by the Federalist controlled United States Congress    As a Democratic Republican  he was elected the third President of the United States in the election of 1800   After peace negotiations with France  his administration reduced military forces  Three years later he waged a brief naval campaign against the Barbary Coast states in North Africa to defend American shipping  During his presidency  the United States purchased the vast western Louisiana Territory from Napoleonic France  1803   and sent out the Lewis and Clark Expedition  18041806  to explore the new West  His second term was beset with difficulties at home  including the failed treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr   Also  American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson signed and implemented the Embargo Act of 1807   in response to British threats to U S  shipping  In 1803  Jefferson initiated a controversial process of Indian tribe removal to the newly organized Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi River   In 1807  he signed into law the intensely debated Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves that banned slave importation into the United States   A champion of the Age of Enlightenment   Jefferson  was diversely talented in the arts  sciences  agriculture and politics  He was a proven architect in the classical tradition   and designed his home Monticello   the Virginia State Capitol and other important buildings  His keen interest in religion and philosophy also earned him the presidency of the American Philosophical Society   Besides English  he was well versed in Latin   Greek   French   Italian and Spanish    He founded the University of Virginia in his retirement from public office  Although ineffectual as an orator  Jefferson was a skilled writer and corresponded with many influential people in America and Europe  Most historians believe that after the death of his wife Martha in 1782  he had a long term relationship  possibly non consensual  with his female slave Sally Hemings   and fathered at least some of her children   In the aggregate  Jefferson is ranked by historians as the fifth most successful President      Jefferson was born the third of ten children  on April 13  1743  April 2  1743 OS   at the family home in Shadwell  Virginia     His father was Peter Jefferson   a planter and surveyor who died when Jefferson was fourteen  His mother was Jane Randolph   daughter of Isham Randolph   a ship s captain and planter  He showed little interest in learning about his ancestry  on his father s side he only knew of the existence of his grandfather        a   Jefferson s earliest memory was being handed to a slave on horseback and carried 50 miles away to their new home which overlooked the Rivanna River in current Albemarle County   His facial appearance resembled that of his father but his slim physique was typical of his mother s family    He was of English and possible Welsh descent     Peter Jefferson s friend William Randolph died a widower in 1745  having appointed Peter as guardian to manage his Tuckahoe Plantation and care for his four children  That year the Jeffersons relocated to Tuckahoe where they lived for the next seven years before returning to Shadwell in 1752  Peter Jefferson died in 1757 and the Jefferson estate was divided between Peter s two sons  Thomas and Randolph     Thomas inherited approximately 5 000 acres  2 000ha  7 8sqmi  of land  including Monticello   and between 20 and 40 slaves  and unfettered control of the property at age 21     Jefferson began his childhood education beside the Randolph children with tutors at Tuckahoe    In 1752  he began attending a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister  At age nine  he initiated his study of Latin  Greek  and French  he learned to ride horses  and began nature studies  He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by Reverend James Maury near Gordonsville  Virginia while boarding with Maury s family and there studied history  science and the classics     Jefferson entered the College of William   Mary in Williamsburg  Virginia at age 16  and studied mathematics  metaphysics and philosophy under Professor William Small   Small introduced him to the British Empiricists including John Locke   Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton   He also improved his French  Greek and his skill at the violin  Jefferson graduated in 1762  completing his studies in two years  Through Small he made the acquaintance of law professor George Wythe     Jefferson read the law under the tutelage of Wythe to obtain his law license  while working as a law clerk in Wythe s office  He also read a wide variety of English classics and political works   Jefferson treasured his books  and in 1770 his Shadwell home  including a library of 200 volumes inherited from his father  was destroyed by fire    nevertheless  by 1773 he replenished his library with 1 250 titles  and in 1815 his collection had grown to almost 6 500 volumes  including some inherited from George Wythe    He thus accumulated thousands of books for his library at Monticello  After the British burned the Library of Congress in 1814  he sold more than 6 000 books to the Library for  23 950  Then realizing he was no longer in possession of such a grand collection  he wrote to John Adams    I cannot live without books   He had intended to pay off some of his large debt  yet started buying more books   On January 1  1772 Jefferson married his third cousin Martha Wayles Skelton   the 23 year old widow of Bathurst Skelton      Their marriage took place at the house of Martha s father and was conducted by the Reverend William Coutts    She was a frequent hostess for Jefferson  managed the large household and their joyful marriage is considered the happiest period of his life    Martha read widely  did fine needle work and was an skilled pianist  Jefferson  who was accomplished on the violin and cello  often accompanied her musically    It is said that she was attracted to him largely because of their mutual love of music      During their ten years of marriage  Martha bore six children  Martha  Patsy   17721836   Jane  17741775   a son who lived for only a few weeks in 1777  Mary Wayles  Polly   17781804   Lucy Elizabeth  17801781   and another Lucy Elizabeth  17821785   Only Martha and Mary survived more than a few years    After her father John Wayles died in 1773  Martha and her husband inherited 135 slaves  11 000 acres  4 500ha  17sqmi  and the debts of his estate  These took Jefferson and other co executors of the estate years to satisfy  which contributed to his own financial problems     Martha later suffered from ill health including diabetes  and frequent childbirth further weakened her  A few months after the birth of her last child  she died on September 6  1782  at the age of 33 with Jefferson at her bedside  He was so distraught that in the following three weeks he shut himself in his room  where he paced back and forth nearly to the point of exhaustion  Later he often took long rides on secluded roads to mourn for his wife      Martha s mother had died young  and as a girl Martha lived with two stepmothers  Shortly before her death  she told Jefferson that she could not bear to have another mother raise her children  and pleaded with him to never to marry again  He made and kept a solemn promise in that regard       Jefferson in 1768 had begun construction of his primary residence Monticello  Italian for  Little Mountain   on a hilltop overlooking a 5 000 acre plantation    b   Construction was done mostly by local masons and carpenters  appreciably assisted by Jefferson s slaves    He moved into the South Pavilion in 1770  where his wife Martha joined him in 1772  Turning Monticello into a neoclassical masterpiece in the Palladian style was his perennial project     Jefferson mastered architecture through self study  using various books and classical architectural designs of the day  His primary authority was Andrea Palladio  s The Four Books of Architecture   which exposed him to the principles of classical design      While serving as Minister to France  Jefferson had the opportunity to survey the foremost classical buildings he had reviewed in his reading  as well the  modern  trends in French architecture then fashionable in Paris  After working as Secretary of State  179093   he began rebuilding Monticello based on the concepts he had acquired in Europe  The remodeling continued throughout most of his presidency  the most notable change being the octagonal dome       Jefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767 and then lived with his mother at Shadwell    His law practice included clients from his mother s family  the Randolphs     and his work took him throughout the Shenandoah Valley    The fire at Shadwell had also claimed his legal papers and notes for the coming term of court  and though he was frantic  George Wythe consoled him with a line from Virgil   Carry on  and preserve yourselves for better times      In addition to practicing law Jefferson represented Albemarle County as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1769 until 1775    He proved more willing to reform slavery in his early career than later when he became a more substantial slaveholder  In 1769 he introduced legislation allowing masters to assume full control over the emancipation of slaves  taking the discretion away from the royal Governor and his General Court  Jefferson had persuaded his cousin Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation s passage  but the reaction in the House was strongly negative  He recalled Bland was  treated with the grossest indecorum      Jefferson worked on a number of lawsuits on behalf of freedom seeking slaves    He took the case of Samuel Howell without charging him a fee    Howell  of inter racial grandparents  claimed he should be freed before the statutory age of thirty one required for emancipation in such a case  Jefferson  invoking Natural Law   argued   everyone comes into the world with a right to his own person and using it at his own will    This is what is called personal liberty  and is given him by the author of nature  because it is necessary for his own sustenance   The judge hearing the Howell case abruptly cut him off and ruled against his client  As a consolation  Jefferson gave Howell some money  presumably used to aid his escape shortly thereafter    Jefferson later successfully incorporated the argument into the Declaration of Independence     Although earlier discouraged  smallpox inoculation began in 17681769 in Norfolk County  Virginia  and precipitated riots  Jefferson defended the riots  victims  including Dr  Archibald Campbell whose house was burned  Jefferson  himself inoculated at age 23  gave up his law practice before the case was resolved  but later served on a General Assembly committee which sought to reduce the 1769 restrictions on the inoculations     Following the passage of the Intolerable Acts by the British Parliament in 1774  Jefferson wrote a resolution against the acts calling for The day of Fasting and Prayer in protest  The resolution also called for a boycott of all British goods  These were later expanded into A Summary View of the Rights of British America   in which he expressed his belief that people had the right to govern themselves      Jefferson served as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War    He sought out John Adams who  along with the latter s cousin Samuel  had emerged as a leader of the Congress    Jefferson and Adams established a permanent friendship which led to Jefferson primary drafting of the Declaration of Independence  Adams supported Jefferson s appointment to the Committee of Five formed to write the formal Declaration in furtherance of the Lee Resolution passed by the Congress    After discussing the general outline of the document  the committee decided that Jefferson would write the first draft  The committee in general  and Jefferson in particular  thought Adams should write the document  but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson  Though he was reluctant to take the assignment  he agreed and Adams promised to consult with him upon completion    c    Consulting with other committee members over the next seventeen days  Jefferson also drew on his own proposed draft of the Virginia Constitution   George Mason  s draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights and other sources    The other committee members made some changes  most notably  Jefferson had written   We hold these truths to be sacred and un deniable     which Franklin changed to read   We hold these truths to be self evident     A final draft was presented to the Congress on June 28  1776   Congress debated the Declaration and deleted nearly a fourth of the text  most notably a passage critical of the slave trade    While Jefferson resented the changes  he did not speak publicly about the revisions    d   On July 4  1776  the Congress ratified the Declaration of Independence and the delegates signed the document on August 2  The Declaration is considered one of Jefferson s major achievements  his preamble is regarded as an enduring statement of human rights  Indeed  the phrase   all men are created equal   has been called  one of the best known sentences in the English language  containing  the most potent and consequential words in American history        Jefferson viewed the independence of the American people from the mother country Britain as breaking away from  parent stock   and that the War of Independence from Britain was a natural outcome of being separated by the Atlantic Ocean     In his view  English colonists were compelled to rely on  common sense  and rediscover the   laws of nature      He also maintained the Independence of the original British colonies was part of a historical pattern following a similar divergence when the Saxons left their mother country Europe hundreds of years earlier and colonized Britain     After the colonies declared their Independence  Jefferson was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776  where the finalization of a state constitution was a priority      He commented on the drafting of the constitution  saying he supported freehold suffrage   by which only landowners could vote  For nearly three years  he assisted with the constitution  He was especially proud of the Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom    He served as a Delegate until 1779  Another object of importance to him was to disestablish the Anglican church in Virginia  but this was not done until 1786  while he was in France as US Minister    After Thomas Ludwell Lee died in 1778 Jefferson was given the task of studying and revising the state s laws  Jefferson drafted 126 bills in three years  including laws to establish fee simple tenure in land and to streamline the judicial system  Jefferson s statutes abolished primogeniture and provided for general education  which he considered the basis of  republican government     His  Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge  led to some small changes at the College of William   Mary  and reduced control by clergy     In 1779  at the age of thirty six  Jefferson was elected Governor of Virginia by the two houses of the legislature for a term of one year  then re elected for an additional year    As governor in 1780  he transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond   A range of measures were introduced by Jefferson during his time as Governor of Virginia  including public education  inheritance laws and religious freedom  He served as a wartime governor  as the united colonies continued the Revolutionary War against Great Britain  and prepared Richmond in 1780 for an attack  by moving all military supplies to a foundry located five miles outside of town  In January 1781 General Benedict Arnold captured the foundry during his invasion of Richmond  Jefferson called for the Virginia militia to defend the city  but when the defense arrived  led by Sampson Mathews   it was too late to prevent the siege    Jefferson evacuated Richmond as the armies engaged     Cornwallis that spring dispatched a 250 man cavalry force led by Banastre Tarleton on a secret expedition to capture the Governor and members of the Assembly at Monticello but Jack Jouett of the Virginia militia thwarted the British plan  Jefferson escaped to Poplar Forest   his plantation to the west    His gubernatorial term expired in June and he spent much of the summer with his family at Poplar Forest  His tenure as governor in general  and his decision to flee the capital in particular  has been criticized    The members of the General Assembly quickly reconvened in June 1781 in Staunton  Virginia across the Blue Ridge Mountains  and considered an official inquiry into Jefferson s actions  as they believed he had failed his responsibilities as governor  Jefferson was not re elected    In that year also his daughter Lucy died at age one  A second daughter of that name was born the following year but died as well at age 3     Jefferson received a letter of inquiry in 1780 about the geography  history and government of Virginia from French diplomat Franois Barb Marbois   who was gathering data on the United States  Jefferson included his written responses in a book  Notes on the State of Virginia  1785     He compiled the book over five years  including reviews of scientific knowledge  Virginia s history  politics  laws  culture and geography  He was assisted by Thomas Walker   George R  Clark and geographer Thomas Hutchins     The book is his argument about what constitutes a good society  which he believed was embodied in Virginia  It also included extensive data about the state s natural resources and its economy  He as well wrote extensively about slavery  miscegenation and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of resentments over slavery      He said that   Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God  if ever he had chosen a people       In 1785 Jefferson s Notes     was anonymously published in Paris in a limited French edition of a few hundred copies  Its first public English edition  issued by John Stockdale in London  appeared in 1787     Following its victory in the Revolutionary War and peace treaty with Great Britain in 1783  the United States formed a Continental Congress to which Jefferson was appointed as a Virginia delegate  As a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates  he recommended an American currency based on the decimal system and his plan was adopted    He also advised formation of the Committee of the States   to fill the power vacuum when Congress was in recess    When Congress adjourned the following June  the Committee met but within two months disagreements divided the members  Jefferson learned of the ordeal while in France  and spoke to Franklin who compared the Committee to a  needed light house  and its members to a  raging sea   rendering it inaccessible and dysfunctional     In the 178384 session of the Congress Jefferson acted as chairman of important committees  to establish a viable system of government for the new Republic  and propose a policy for the settlement of the western territories  Jefferson was the principal author of the Land Ordinance of 1784 whereby Virginia ceded to the national government the vast area it claimed northwest of the Ohio River   He insisted this territory not be used as colonial territory by any of the thirteen states  but that it be divided into sections which could become states    He plotted borders for nine new states in their initial stages and also wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation s territories  Congress made extensive revisions including rejection of the ban of slavery  Jefferson thought that Congress had  mutilated  his work  but accepted the majority s changes      The provisions banning slavery  known later as the Jefferson Proviso   were modified and implemented three years later in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and became the law for the entire Northwest     Jefferson was sent by the Confederation Congress   e   to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams as ministers in Europe for negotiation of trade agreements with England  Spain  and France  Some believed the recently widowed Jefferson was depressed and that the assignment would distract him from his wife s death    Taking his young daughter Patsy and two servants  he departed from Boston in July of 1784 and arrived in Paris the next month      Jefferson taught himself to read and write Spanish during the nineteen day voyage  using a copy of Don Quixote      Four days after his arrival  Jefferson rode out to Passy to greet Franklin    When the French foreign minister  the Count de Vergennes   commented to Jefferson   You replace Monsieur Franklin  I hear   Jefferson replied   I succeed him  No man can replace him       Franklin resigned as minister to France in March 1785  and departed in July after a ceremony at Passy     Jefferson had Patsy educated at the Pentemont Abbey   he taught her French and helped her with her studies  To serve the household   Jefferson brought some of his slaves  including James Hemings   whom he had trained in French cuisine    In 1786  Jefferson  through his artist friend John Trumbull   met and fell in love with Maria Cosway   an accomplished  and married  Italian English musician of 27  They saw each other frequently over a period of six weeks  She returned to Great Britain  but they maintained a lifelong correspondence    Jefferson sent for his youngest surviving child  nine year old Polly  in June 1787  She was accompanied by Sally Hemings   a slave and younger sister of James  That year he suffered a fall and fractured his right wrist  requiring him to write with his left hand  at least for a time     While in France he became a regular companion of Lafayette   and used his influence to procure trade agreements with France  Duties on whale oil were removed  and Jefferson directed more of the tobacco trade directly to France eliminating British intermediaries      He often dined with many of the city s prominent people  and accumulated various wines for return to the United States    Jefferson corresponded with many pivotal supporters of revolution including the Comte de Mirabeau   a popular pamphleteer who repeated ideals that had been the basis for the American Revolution      He wrote a letter to Edward Carrington expressing similar concepts he held of the natural tendencies of government and its relationship to the people  saying in one instance   the natural process of things is for liberty to yield  and government to gain ground      As the French Revolution began  Jefferson allowed his Paris residence  the Htel de Langeac  to be used for meetings by Lafayette and other republicans  he was in Paris during the storming of the Bastille    Jefferson often found his mail opened and inspected by various postmasters  so he began to write his important messages using a code  and invented his own enciphering device  the  Wheel Cipher     Indeed  he wrote important communications in codes the remainder of his career    Jefferson left Paris in September 1789  he thought temporarily    but was prevented from returning by virtue of his appointment as the nation s chief diplomat    He remained a firm supporter of the French Revolution  although he was opposed to some of its very violent elements     Soon after Jefferson s return from France  he accepted President Washington s invitation to serve as Secretary of State    In his new position  Jefferson strongly opposed Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton on issues of national fiscal policy  especially the funding of war debts    He later associated Hamilton s Federalist Party with  Royalism   and said the  Hamiltonians were panting after    crowns  coronets and mitres       The first major issues before the Cabinet were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital  Jefferson had always opposed the mounting debt  Hamilton  desirous of the national government consolidating the various states  debts  proposed his Assumption bill to which Jefferson found objection    They also differed on the permanent location of the capital  Hamilton wanted the capital close to the major commercial centers of the Northeast  whereas Washington and Jefferson  along with other agrarians  wanted it located to the south  After much deliberation  the Compromise of 1790 was struck at a private dinner including Madison  Under the terms of this agreement  the nation s capital was located on the Potomac River   and the federal government assumed the war debts of all 13 states     In May 1792 Jefferson was alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape  and wrote to Washington  urging him to run for re election that year as a unifying influence   The confidence of the whole nation is centred in you  You being at the helm will be more than an answer to every argument which can be used to alarm and lead the people  in any quarter  into violence or secession     He entreated the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests  as espoused by the Federalists  Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of Democratic Republican Party principles    In their opposition to Hamilton  Jefferson and other Democratic Republican organizers favored states  rights and local control  and sought to prevent concentration of power in a central government  He continued to work closely with Madison to strengthen the party     The French minister Citizen Genet said in 1793   Senator Morris and Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton    had the greatest influence over the President s mind  and that it was only with difficulty that he  Jefferson  counterbalanced their efforts     Jefferson supported France against Britain when they fought in 1793    He believed that political success at home depended on victory for the French army in Europe  with reservation as to the brutality of the French Revolution   During his discussions with George Hammond   first British Minister to the U S  beginning in 1791  Jefferson tried unsuccessfully to obtain British agreement  1  to acknowledge their violation of the Treaty of Paris  2  to vacate their posts in the Northwest and 3  to compensate the United States for slaves whom the British had freed at the end of the war  In keeping with a passion for his private life  Jefferson resigned the cabinet position in December 1793  He is also said to have considered it an opportune time to bolster his political influence from outside the administration  Future developments indeed bore that out     From his base at Monticello  he organized nationwide opposition to the Jay Treaty of 1794  thereby giving his party a bona fide cause to harness in combatting the Federalists    The treaty was designed by Hamilton and supported by Washington  it aimed to reduce tensions and enhance friendly relations as well as trade with Britain  Jefferson warned that it would increase British influence and subvert republicanism  saying   Thus it is  that Hamilton  Jay  etc   in the boldest act they ever ventured on to undermine the government    A bolder party stroke was never struck     The Treaty passed  but he made sure it was not renewed when it expired in 1805  Jefferson continued his pro French stance  during the violence of the Reign of Terror in France  he declined to disavow the revolution because  To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America      In the presidential campaign of 1796 Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams by 7168  and he was thereby elected as Vice President  He initially intended to forego the swearing in ceremony  which he thought monarchical  but relented    As the commensurate presiding officer of the Senate  Jefferson assumed a more passive role than Adams had as Vice President  He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to issues of procedure which brought him an  honorable and easy  role  He was concerned about the absence of rules as to his authority over the Senate  Years before holding this premier office  Jefferson had studied parliamentary law and procedure for forty years  and had transcribed notes on parliamentary law into a manual which he entitled Parliamentary Pocket Book   making him uniquely qualified to preside in the Senate    He had also served on the committee appointed to draw up the rules of order for the Continental Congress in 1776 and as Vice President  he was able to formulate some Senatorial procedures   With the Quasi War underway  the Federalists under John Adams rebuilt the military  levied new taxes and enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts   Jefferson believed that these laws were intended to suppress Democratic Republicans  rather than prosecute enemy aliens  and also thought they were unconstitutional  saying   The violations of the Constitution  propensities to war  to expense    which we have lately seen  are becoming evident to the people       To rally opposition  he and Madison anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions respectively  declaring that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states    Though the resolutions followed the   interposition   approach of Madison  Jefferson advocated nullification   Jefferson s Kentucky draft said   where powers are assumed which have not been delegated  a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy  that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact   casus non fderis  to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits       In writing the Kentucky Resolutions  Jefferson warned that   unless arrested at the threshold   the Alien and Sedition Acts would  necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood     Historian Chernow has opined that the theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was  deep and lasting  and was a recipe for disunion     Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if  systematically and pertinaciously pursued   they would  dissolve the union or produce coercion     The influence of Jefferson s doctrine of states  rights is said to have reverberated to the Civil War and beyond     He held four confidential talks with the French consul Joseph Letombe in the spring of 1797  In these meetings  Jefferson attacked Adams  predicted that he would only serve one term  and encouraged France to invade England  Jefferson advised Letombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris by instructing him to  listen to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings   This toughened the tone that the French government adopted with the new Adams administration  Due to pressure on the Adams administration from Jefferson and his supporters  Congress released the papers related to the XYZ Affair   which rallied a shift in popular opinion from Jefferson and the French government to the support of Adams     The presidential election of 1800 found Jefferson s Democratic Republican Party garnering the majority of votes in the electoral college  however  Jefferson and fellow party candidate Aaron Burr received an equal number of votes  Due to the tie  the election was decided by the Federalist dominated House of Representatives      f   Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton convinced his party that Jefferson would be a lesser political evil than Burr   On February 17  1801  after thirty six ballots  the House elected Jefferson President and Burr Vice President    Jefferson is said to have owed his election victory to the South s inflated number of Electors  which counted slaves under the three fifths compromise       It was also alleged that Jefferson  through Maryland representative  Samuel Smith   secured James Asheton Bayard s tie breaking electoral vote in exchange for guaranteeing the retention of various Federalist posts in the government    Jefferson disputed the allegation and no documents are conclusive     Jefferson was sworn in by Chief Justice John Marshall at the new Capitol in Washington DC on March 4  1801  In contrast to his predecessors  Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette  he arrived alone on horseback without escort and dressed in plain attire     He was regarded by his supporters as the  People s President   Jefferson s election was well received and the event was marked by celebrations throughout the country  Nevertheless  at the time partisan strife between the Democratic Republican and Federalist parties had grown to new levels  Some of Jefferson s political opponents referred to him as the  Negro President   with critics like the Mercury and New England Palladium of Boston stating that he had the gall to celebrate his election as a victory for democracy when he won  the temple of Liberty on the shoulders of slaves      Upon assumed office he first confronted an  83 million national debt    He began to dismantle Hamilton s Federalist fiscal system  His Secretary of Treasury  Albert Gallatin   claimed that  if this administration shall not reduce taxes  they never will be permanently reduced     The Swiss born Gallatin was Jefferson s most valued administrator and a critic of Alexander Hamilton s fiscal policy    Jefferson s administration began by eliminating the whiskey excise and all other federal internal taxes  claiming that closing  unnecessary offices   as well as cutting  useless establishments and expenses   allowed for the discontinuation of internal taxes      The new executive also attempted to disassemble the national bank and its effect of increasing the national debt  Also reduced was much of the Navy  deemed unnecessary during peacetime    Jefferson nominated moderate Republicans including James Madison as Secretary of State  Henry Dearborn Secretary of War  Levi Lincoln Attorney General  and Robert Smith Secretary of Navy    At the conclusion of his two terms  he had reduced the national debt by over  12 million     In May 1801 the Secretary of War Henry Dearborn announced that the president had appointed Major Jonathan Williams to investigate the establishment of a national school of military education    Following the advice of Washington  Adams  Hamilton and others    Jefferson and the Congress in 1802 authorized the funding and construction of the United States Military Academy at West Point on the Hudson River  On March 16  1802  he signed the Military Peace Establishment Act  directing that a corps of engineers be established and  constitute a Military Academy   The Act provided well trained officers for a professional army  The operation of the US Military Academy at West Point formally started on July 4  1802   Jefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts  He repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801   which removed nearly all of Adams   midnight judges  from office  and led to the Supreme Court s decision in the landmark case of Marbury v  Madison   Another provision was repealed in the Judiciary Act which had required supreme court justices to travel the country extensively to serve as circuit court judges  Jefferson also signed into law a bill that officially segregated the U S  postal system by not allowing blacks to carry the mail    why         The First Barbary War was declared during Jefferson s initial term as president and was the first conducted by the U S  on foreign soil and seas    American merchant ships had previously been protected from the Barbary pirates by the British navy    For decades later  North African pirates captured American merchant ships  pillaged valuable cargoes and enslaved crew members  followed by ransom demands     Jefferson had previously recommended naval forces be limited to those required for coastal defense  but the pirate attacks and the systematic kidnapping of American crew members expanded the need  In 1801 the cabinet voted unanimously to send a fleet of three frigates and a schooner to the Mediterranean under the command of Richard Dale   with orders to make a show of force while negotiating for peace if possible  nevertheless  Tripoli declared war upon the United States    The American navy forced Tunis and Algiers into breaking their alliance with Tripoli which ultimately left it disarmed  Jefferson also ordered five separate naval bombardments of Tripoli  which temporarily restored peace in the Mediterranean     In 1802  Jefferson initiated a negotiation for the purchase of the city of New Orleans and adjacent coastal areas from France  The area under discussion mushroomed  and Napoleon I agreed to sell a territory in excess of a million square miles for  15 million  less  3 75 million in previously settled debts owed to the U S   Total inhabitants were 80 00090 000 including about 40 000 slaves  The purchase was ratified by the Senate by a vote of 247    Most thought this was an exceptional opportunity  apart from Constitutional reservations as to the power of the government to acquire land    The new territory proved to be one of the largest fertile tracts of land on the planet  and it marked the end of French imperial ambitions in North America which conflicted with American expansion west     The Louisiana Purchase was domestically complicated by the pre existing establishment of French slaveholders there  Faced with the option to confiscate the slaves of French nationals  Jefferson chose to quickly integrate resident settlers politically and legally into U S  territories  allowing for slavery to continue in the newly acquired territory along with the local adoption of the Code Napoleon   Since the purchase  historians have differed in their assessments regarding constitutional and slavery issues  but Jefferson s acquisition is considered a pivotal contribution toward America s western growth     Anticipating further westward settlements as a result of the Louisiana Purchase  Jefferson arranged for the exploration and mapping of the unchartered territory  It was also important to establish a U S  claim ahead of competing European interests  and to find the remote Northwest passage     Knowledge of the western continent was limited to what had been learned casually from trappers and traders    Influenced by exploration accounts of Le Page du Pratz in Louisiana  1763  and Captain James Cook in the Pacific  1784     Jefferson and others persuaded Congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory to the Pacific Ocean     Jefferson appointed Meriwether Lewis and William Clark leaders of the Corps of Discovery   to explore and document scientific and geographic knowledge    Lewis had extensive military woodlands experience and proved an apt student of the sciences of mapping  botany  natural history  mineralogy and navigation    Lewis and Clark recruited a company of 45 men and spent a winter preparing near St  Louis    Setting out in May 1804 and guided by Sacagawea and various Native American tribes along the way  the expedition traced the Columbia River and reached the Pacific Ocean by November 1805  They returned to St  Louis September 23  1806  having lost only one man to disease  The expedition obtained a wealth of scientific and geographic knowledge  including knowledge of the many Indian tribes     In addition to the Corps of Discovery   Jefferson organized three other western expeditions including the William Dunbar and George Hunter expedition on the Ouachita River  18041805   the Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis expedition  1806  on the Red River   and the Zebulon Pike expedition  18061807  into the Rocky Mountains and the Southwest    All of the excursions sent out under Jefferson s presidency produced valuable information about the American frontier     As governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War  Jefferson had recommended forcibly moving to lands west of the Mississippi River the Cherokee and Shawnee tribes who had allied with the British  But once in the White House  Jefferson wanted to avoid an armed conflict with Native Americans    He told his Secretary of War  General Henry Dearborn   then in charge of Indian affairs   if we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe  we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated  or driven beyond the Mississippi     With the colonial and native civilizations in collision  compounded by British incitement of Indian tribes  Jefferson s administration took quick measures to avert another major conflict     He made a deal with officials of Georgia   if Georgia would release its legal claims to lands to its west  the U S  military would help expel the Cherokee people from Georgia  This facilitated his policy of western expansion  to  advance compactly as we multiply     His deal arguably violated an existing treaty between the United States government and the Cherokee Nation   which guaranteed its people the right to their historic lands    Jefferson believed that natives should abandon their own cultures  religions and lifestyles  and assimilate to western European customs and agriculture  which was considered more beneficial      He also contended that integration of Native Americans into the European American economy would make them more dependent on trade  and they would eventually be willing to give up land in exchange for trade goods or debt curtailments    In keeping with his trade and acculturation policy  Jefferson kept Benjamin Hawkins as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southeastern peoples  who became known as the Five Civilized Tribes for their adoption of European American ways   Haiti was founded in 1804 as the second republic in the world after its successful slave revolution in the French colony of Saint Domingue  Jefferson refused to diplomatically recognize Haiti  fearing the success of the  slave republic  would rouse the American South s slaves to rebellion  Jefferson also supported an arms and trade embargo against Haiti    Nevertheless  during the Haitian revolution  when Jefferson wanted to discourage French control in 18021803  he allowed arms and contraband goods to reach Saint Domingue     Frustrated by Republican Party national dominance  a few New England Federalists in 1804 launched a misguided effort to secede northern states from the Union    Aaron Burr   Jefferson s Vice President  ran for governor of New York  and showed interest in the movement  however  Burr lost the election and the New England conspiracy ended  Burr ended his political career when he mortally wounded Hamilton in a duel at Weehawken that year     During 1805 the Jefferson administration was faced with disputes over the exact boundaries of the Louisiana Territory with Mexico  and the fate of the Floridas  which Spain refused to cede to the United States    Burr in 1806 spread rumors of military adventurism  troop enlistment  increases in arms and ships on the upper Ohio River  Conspiring with Burr in this misinformation was Jefferson appointee Governor James Wilkinson who acted as a spy for Spain      Burr s plan included the capture of New Orleans   invading Mexico and uniting the Western part of the United States with the conquered country  by an army led by Wilkinson    Wilkinson inexplicably renounced the plot and reported Burr s treachery to Jefferson from New Orleans    In November Jefferson issued a proclamation that persons including  citizens of the United States  were conspiring to take over Spanish territory     Jefferson requested Congressional authority to employ land or naval forces of the U S   in cases of insurrection   and in his message to Congress on January 1807  he declared Burr s  guilt is placed beyond question   By late March 1807 Burr was arrested and charged with treason but was acquitted at trial  Wilkinson  who barely escaped indictment  had deleted from court documents evidence of his earlier collaboration with Burr    Jefferson did not appear in person to answer Chief Justice John Marshall s subpoena to testify  but sent relevant documents instead  setting a precedent for executive privilege  Though Burr s acquittal enraged Jefferson  his career was shattered    Jefferson removed Wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the U S  military     Jefferson s successful first term occasioned his re nomination for president by the Republican party and his re election in 1804 for a second term    George Clinton replaced Burr as his running mate following Burr s killing of Hamilton in their duel of July that year  The Federalist party ran Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina  who had been John Adam s vice presidential candidate  The Jefferson Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote  by 162 to 14  promoting their achievement of lower taxes  booming economic prosperity and the Louisiana Purchase     A split developed in the Republican party  led by fellow Virginian John Randolph of Roanoke in March 1806  Jefferson and Madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban British imports in retaliation for British actions against American shipping  Madison also proposed spending  20 million in roads and canals in infrastructure  leading to the National Road west from Maryland  Randolph felt these measures were akin to Federalist activism  and he formed a congressional caucus of   Quids    calling for purity in republican principles and roundly denouncing both Jefferson and Madison     Jefferson s popularity further suffered in his second term due to his response to wars in Europe  Positive relations with Great Britain had diminished due partly to the antipathy between Jefferson and the British Ambassador  Anthony Merry   And after Napoleon s decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805  Napoleon became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights  which American efforts failed to counter  Jefferson then led the enactment of the Embargo Act of 1807   directed at both France and Great Britain  This triggered economic chaos in the US and was strongly criticized at the time  resulting in Jefferson having to abandon the policy a year later     Following the Revolution the states abolished the international slave trade  but South Carolina reopened it  Jefferson in his annual message of December 1806 denounced the  violations of human rights  attending the international slave trade  calling on the newly elected Congress to criminalize it immediately    In 1807  congress passed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves   which Jefferson signed      While the act established severe punishment against international slave trade  it did not address the issue domestically   In the wake of the Louisiana Purchase   Jefferson sought to annex Florida from Spain  as brokered by Emperor Napoleon     Congress agreed to the president s request to secretly appropriate purchase money  in the   2 000 000 Bill     The Congressional funding drew criticism from Randolph who believed the money would wind up in coffers of Napoleon  The bill was signed into law  however  negotiations for the project failed  Jefferson lost clout among fellow Republicans and his use of unofficial Congressional channels was sharply criticized     The British conducted raids on American shipping and kidnapped seamen in 180607  thousands of Americans were thus impressed into their service  In 1806 Jefferson issued a call for a boycott of British goods  on April 18 Congress passed the Non Importation Acts but they were never enforced  Later that year Jefferson asked James Monroe and William Pinkney to negotiate with Great Britain to end the harassment of American shipping  though Britain showed no signs of improving relations  A treaty was finalized  however it lacked any provisions to end impressment     The British ship HMS Leopard fired upon the USS Chesapeake off the Virginia coast in June 1807  and Jefferson prepared for war    He issued a proclamation banning armed British ships from U S  waters  He presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100 000 militia and ordered the purchase of arms  ammunition and supplies  saying  The laws of necessity  of self preservation  of saving our country when in danger  are of higher obligation  than strict observance of written laws    The USS Revenge   dispatched to demand an explanation from the British government  was also fired upon  Jefferson called for a special session of Congress in October to enact an embargo or in the alternative consider war     In December news arrived that Napoleon had extended the Berlin Decree  globally banning British imports  In Britain  George III ordered redoubling efforts at impressment  including American sailors  But the war fever of the summer fadedCongress had no appetite to prepare the U S  for war  Jefferson asked for and received the Embargo Act   the optimal choice for him  as it gained more time for building up defensive works  militias and naval forces  Historian Jon Meecham opined the Embargo Act was a projection of power which surpassed the Alien and Sedition Acts   Secretary of State James Madison supported the embargo with more vigor than Jefferson  while the Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin opposed  due to its indefinite time frame and the risk it posed to the policy of American neutrality    The U S  economy suffered and criticism grew  with Jefferson s party losing support  and efforts began to work around the embargo  Instead of retreating  Jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and violators    Three acts were passed in Congress during 1807 and 1808  called the Supplementary   the Additional and the Enforcement acts    Though the government could not prevent American vessels from trading with the European belligerents once they had left American ports  the embargo triggered a devastating decline in exports  Shortly before leaving office in March 1809  Jefferson signed the repeal of the Embargo  In its place the Non Intercourse Act was passed  but it proved no more effective     Jefferson believed that the failure of the embargo was due to selfish traders and merchants showing a lack of  republican virtue  by not complying with it    Many historians have considered that Jefferson s embargo was ineffective and harmful to American interests    Others portray it as an innovative non violent measure which aided France in its war with Britain  while preserving American neutrality      Jefferson maintained that  had the embargo been widely observed  it would have avoided war in 1812       Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States  As president  Jefferson used his influence to bring Ohio into the Union on April 30  1802  the first state under the Northwest Ordinance  In Congress  Jefferson had authored the Ordinance of 1787 in Congressional committee under the Articles of Confederation  He was therefore instrumental in prohibiting slavery not only to new territories  but in new states beginning with Ohio     Jefferson was for 35 years a member of the American Philosophical Society   founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin   Through the Society he advanced the sciences and Enlightenment ideals  emphasizing that knowledge of science reinforced and extended freedom    He was elected to the Society in January 1780 while Governor of Virginia and the following year was elected a Counsellor  During his long tenure he served on many committees  He became the Society s third President on March 3  1797  only days after he was elected Vice President under Adams      Upon his acceptance Jefferson stated   I feel no qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the extremes of society  beggars and kings     During this time he was compiling data for his Notes on the State of Virginia which he later shared with the Society  He served as the Society s president for the next eighteen years through both terms of his presidency    Along with topics on science and discovery  he often discussed ideas of abolition with dedicated abolitionist Society members including Comte de Volney and Tadeusz Kosciuszko       Jefferson also introduced Meriwether Lewis to the Society where various scientists tutored him in preparation for the Lewis and Clark Expedition       He offered his letter of resignation on three separate occasions  with the Society refusing each time  The Society finally accepted his resignation at the meeting of January 20  1815  with great reluctance   He remained active through correspondence    After Jefferson s death in 1826 the Society draped the chair he had occupied in black for six months    Jefferson was also elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1787    He became an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1809    and was a member of the American Antiquarian Society        In the years following Jefferson s political retirement he spent most of his time pursuing educational interestsselling his vast collection of books to the Library of Congress  and founding and building the University of Virginia     As he settled into private life at Monticello  Jefferson developed a daily routine of rising early  once remarking   Whether I retire to bed early or late  I rise with the sun   He would spend several hours writing letters  with which he was often deluged  In the midday  he would often inspect the plantation on horseback  visiting the fields and the nailery  In the evenings  his family ate dinner and often recreated in the gardens  late at night  Jefferson would retire to bed with a book  He once wrote   I never go to bed without an hour  or half hour s previous reading of something moral  whereon to ruminate in the intervals of sleep      He wanted to found a new institution of higher learning free of church influences where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other universities  Jefferson believed educating people was a effective way to establish an stable society and that schools should be paid for by the general public in order to be accessible to students from all social strata     In 1800  Jefferson wrote a letter to Joseph Priestley about his proposed University    In 1819  the 76 year old Jefferson founded the University of Virginia  He initiated and organized the legislative campaign for its charter and with the assistance of Edmund Bacon   purchased the location  Jefferson was the principal designer of the buildings  He also planned the University s curriculum and served as the first rector  Upon opening in 1825  it was the first university to offer a full slate of elective courses to its students  With no campus chapel included in the original plans  the university was notable for being centered about a library rather than a church  reinforcing the principle of separation of church and state   Stylistically  Jefferson was a proponent of the Greek and Roman styles  which he believed to be most representative of American democracy by historical association  Each academic unit was designed with a two story temple front facing the quadrangle  while the library was modeled on the Roman Pantheon   In his vision  any citizen of the state could attend school with the sole criterion being ability       Jefferson s educational ideas were expressed in the configuration of his campus plan  which he called the   Academical Village    Individual academic units were defined as distinct structures  each housed classrooms  faculty offices  and residences  Gardens and vegetable plots are placed behind and surrounded by serpentine walls  affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle   After Jefferson died in 1826  James Madison replaced him as the University Rector    In a codicil to his last will  Jefferson left most of his library to the University    Until his death  Jefferson invited students and faculty of the college to his home     Jefferson learned in the summer of 1824 that Lafayette had accepted an invitation from President James Monroe to visit the United States  Lafayette arrived at Monticello on November 4 in a carriage provided by Jefferson with a military escort of 120 men  Some 200 friends and neighbors also arrived for the reunion  Jefferson s grandson Randolph was present and witnessed the historic reunion   As they approached each other  their uncertain gait quickened itself into a shuffling run  and exclaiming   Ah Jefferson    Ah Lafayette    they burst into tears as they fell into each other s arms   Everyone in attendance stood in respectful silence  many of them stifling sobs of their own  Jefferson and Lafayette then retired to the privacy of the house and began reminiscing the many events and encounters they shared years before     The next morning Jefferson  Lafayette and James Madison rode to the Central Hotel in Charlottesville  After being greeted and honored with speeches they departed the hotel at noon and set out for a tour and banquet at the University of Virginia  In the rotunda of the university with Jefferson seated between Lafayette and Madison they had dinner  with French wine from Monticello  It was the first public function at the University  Jefferson had someone read a speech he had prepared  as his voice was weak  This was Jefferson s last public statement  Lafayette later accepted Jefferson s invitation for honorary membership to the University s Jefferson Literary and Debating Society   After an eleven day visit Lafayette departed Monticello on November 15         Jefferson s health began to deteriorate in July 1825 from a combination of toxemia  uremia  and pneumonia and by June he was confined to bed  He spent most of his waking hours going over his finances and debts  On May 22 he made his last entry in the  Farm Book   noting the price of lamp oil and the cost of lighting his estate  On June 24 he wrote his last letter  to Roger Weightman of a Washington newspaper  the National Intelligencer     in which he reaffirmed his principles in the Declaration of Independence  On July 3 Jefferson was overcome by fever and declined an invitation to Washington to attend an anniversary celebration of the Declaration   During the last hours of his life he was accompanied by his grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph and his doctor  Robley Dunglison   and other family members and friends  and was at ease with the immediacy of death  He said to Dunglison   Well Doctor  you see I am still here yet   To the family s words of hope Jefferson impatiently replied   Do not imagine for a moment that I feel the smallest solicitude as to the result   at which point he gave directions for his funeral  requesting no sort of celebration  He declared   I have done for my country  and for all mankind  all that I could do  and I now resign my soul  without fear  to my God   my daughter to my country     After falling back asleep  Jefferson later woke at eight o clock that evening with a final inquiry   Is it the fourth yet   His doctor replied   It soon will be     On July 4 at 12 50p m   Jefferson died at age 83  it was the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and just a few hours before John Adams       Jefferson s funeral  held July 5 and performed by Reverend Charles Clay  was a simple affair  No invitations were sent  but some friends and visitors came to the ceremony and burial to pay their respects  Jefferson s remains were carried by  servants  family and friends  to the family grave site at Monticello    He wrote his own epitaph  which reads   HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON  AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE  OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM  AND FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA    Though born into a wealthy family  Jefferson died deeply in debt  unable to pass on his estate freely to his heirs    Though he gave instructions for disposal of his assets in his will    his estate  possessions  and slaves were sold at public auctions starting in 1827      In 1831 Monticello was sold by Martha Jefferson Randolph and the other heirs   Jefferson is a historical icon of individual liberty  democracy and republicanism  Some have hailed him as among the most effective architects of the American Revolution  and as a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship    Abraham Lincoln called Jefferson  the most distinguished politician in our history     Jefferson is widely championed as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence  and for having written more than 18 000 letters of political and philosophical substance during his life     Historians have also noted the discrepancy between his articulated views of slavery and his slaveholding  a controversial tenure as governor of Virginia  arguable disloyalty under Washington and Adams  his advocacy of nullification and secession   some personal spending excesses and his diminished second term presidency    Some historians have also criticized the harsh treatment of Native Americans during his tenure    Yet others have noted Jefferson was predominantly a kind and generous employer and master  who expressed deep moral convictions against slavery      A number maintain that many of the criticisms leveled at Jefferson overlook much and are politically and racially biased     Jefferson s political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of John Locke   Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton     whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived    He was also influenced by the writings of Gibbon   Hume   Robertson   Bolingbroke   Montesquieu and Voltaire     He thought the independent yeoman and agrarian life were ideals of republican virtues  He was distrusting of cities and financiers  favored decentralized government power  and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies  Having supported efforts to disestablish the Church of England     and having authored the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom   he pressed for a wall of separation between church and state     The Republicans under Jefferson were strongly influenced by the 18th century British Whig Party   who believed in limited government    His Democratic Republican Party became dominant in early American politics and his views became known as Jeffersonian democracy      According to Jefferson  citizens have  certain inalienable rights  and  Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others       Jeffersonian government not only prohibited individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of others  but also restrained itself from diminishing individual liberty as a protection against tyranny from the majority    While he believed most people could not escape corrupting dependence  the franchise should be extended only to those who could  including the yeoman farmer  He disliked inter generational dependence  such as national debt and unalterable governments    He was convinced that individual liberties were the fruit of equality  threatened only by government    Excesses of democracy in his view were caused by institutional corruptions rather than human nature  He remained less suspicious of working democracy than many of his contemporaries     As president  Jefferson tried to re create the balance between the state and federal governments as it existed under the Articles of Confederation  seeking to shift the balance of power back to the states  He acted out of his republican theory that liberty could only be retained in small  homogeneous societies  He felt that the Federalist system enacted by Washington and Adams had encouraged corrupting patronage and dependence    Many of Jefferson s contradictions can be understood within this philosophical framework  For example  he opposed women s right to vote or any participation in politics because a government must be controlled by the economically independent  Instead he argued   our good ladies    are contented to soothe and calm the minds of their husbands returning ruffled from political debate      As a proponent of democracy  Jefferson considered it to be the very expression of society as a whole  and called for national self determination  cultural uniformity and education of all males of the commonwealth    In his view  public education and a free press were essential to a democratic nation   If a nation expects to be ignorant and free it expects what never was and never will be     The people cannot be safe without information  Where the press is free  and every man able to read  all is safe      After leaving Washington s cabinet as Secretary of State  by October 1795 Jefferson s thoughts turned to the electoral bases of the Republicans and Federalists  The  Republican  classification of the United States for which he advocated included 1   the entire body of landholders  everywhere  and 2   the body of laborers  without land    Republicans united behind Jefferson as Vice President  with the election of 1796 expanding democracy nationwide  including local committees and correspondence networks  County committees framed local Republican tickets and spawned partisan Republican newspapers    Privately  Jefferson promoted Republican candidates to run for local state offices    He sought an aristocracy of merit  an example being his vice presidential candidate choice in George Clinton  the child of Irish immigrants     Beginning with Jefferson s electioneering for the  revolution of 1800   his democratic efforts were based on egalitarian appeals    Jefferson in his later years referred to the 1800 election  as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of  76 was in its form   one  not effected indeed by the sword    but by the    suffrage of the people     Voter participation grew in Jefferson s two terms  increasing to  unimaginable levels  compared to the Federalist Era  with doubled turnouts    John Quincy Adams noted following Jefferson s 1804 election   The power of the Administration rests upon the support of a much stronger majority of the people throughout the Union than the former Administrations ever possessed      In retirement  Jefferson gradually became critical of his home state for violating  the principle of equal political rights the social right of universal male suffrage    Initially  with the onset of the Revolution  Jefferson had accepted Blackstone s principle that property ownership would lead to the independent will required from voters in a republic  but he sought to further expand suffrage by land distribution to the poor    In the heat of the Revolutionary Era and afterward  with Jefferson s support  several states expanded voter eligibility from landed gentry to include male Euro American tax paying citizens  those owning either their own houses or their own tools and paying taxes on them    In response to a pamphlet advocating a Virginia Constitutional Convention  he went further than the radical convention promoters  He sought a  general suffrage  of all taxpayers and militia men  as well as equal representation by voter population in the state legislature  not skewed to favor slave holding regions of the state  He also favored a reform of Virginia s county courthouse system  to more nearly resemble that of the more democratic townships of New England     Jefferson distrusted government banks  and opposed public borrowing which he thought created long term debt  bred monopolies and invited dangerous speculation as opposed to productive labor      He argued that each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years  and not impose a long term debt on subsequent generations     In 1791  President Washington asked Jefferson  then Secretary of State and Alexander Hamilton   the Secretary of the Treasury   if the Congress had the authority to create a national bank   While Hamilton believed Congress had the authority  Jefferson thought a national bank would ignore the needs of individuals and farmers  He also was convinced it would assume powers not granted to the federal government by the States  and therefore would violate the Tenth Amendment as well as the laws of Mortmain  Alienage  Forfeiture  Distribution  and Monopolies          Jefferson used the agrarian resistance to banks and speculators as the first defining principle of an opposition party  recruiting candidates for congress on the issue as early as 1792    In retirement  Jefferson reminded John Taylor in 1816 that they had ever hated the banks which could destroy the state constitutions  already suffering from speculators who  sweep away the fortunes and morals of our citizens   He thought banks were more dangerous than standing armies swindling futurity on a large scale        In a letter to James Madison in 1787  Jefferson wrote   A little rebellion  now and then  is a good thing  and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical     It is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government     Similarly  in a letter to Abigail Adams on February 22  1787 he wrote   The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive  It will often be exercised when wrong  but better so than not to be exercised at all     Concerning Shays  Rebellion after he had heard of the bloodshed  Jefferson wrote to William S  Smith   John Adams  son in law   What signify a few lives lost in a century or two  The tree of liberty must from time to time be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants  It is its natural manure     In another letter to Smith that year Jefferson wrote   And what country can preserve its liberties  if the rulers are not warned from time to time  that this people preserve the spirit of resistance  Let them take arms      As late as 1804 before his second term began  Jefferson even seemed at ease with the prospect of dividing the nation into separate democracies  In view of a prospective republic in the Mississippi River Valley  they would be  as much our children and our descendants  alongside any coastal confederacy remaining   I feel myself as much identified with that  western  country    as with this  United States       g    He said of the French revolution   The liberty of the whole world was depending on the issue of the contest     Jefferson once argued that America would become the world s great  empire of liberty that is  the model for democracy and republicanism    On departing the presidency in 1809  he described America as      trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world  the only monument of human rights  and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self government  from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth  if other regions of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence      Jefferson lived in the Virginia planter economy largely dependent upon slavery   As a wealthy slave owner  he used slave labor to run his household  plantation  tobacco fields and various shops  The first record Jefferson made in regard to slave ownership was in 1774  when he owned 41      In his lifetime he owned about 600 slaves  buying and selling them for the management of his affairs  and regularly maintaining about 130       Jefferson purchased slaves on occasion in order to unite their families       He felt slavery was harmful to both slave and master while utilizing many slaves for profit      Historians are divided on whether he opposed the institution  largely because he was silent on emancipation during his presidency and only freed a few slaves on his Monticello plantation      Some researchers suggest Jefferson s slave ownership contrasted with his philosophy of  all men are created equal     Other historians  however  maintain that the sentiment in this statement is what actually inspired Jefferson to advance legislation to abolish slavery and that he believed slavery was  contrary to the laws of nature  where everyone had a right to personal liberty       In the 1790s  Jefferson opened his own mechanized nailery which enabled mostly younger slaves to make nails  However  while machinery in his shop allowed Jefferson s slaves to work more efficiently  he failed to convince southern farmers that machinery could displace slavery  Instead of eliminating the need for slaves  he realized just how dependent on slave labor the south was    Jefferson wrote in 1816 that  where the disease is most deeply seated  there it will be slowest in eradication  In the Northern States it was merely super cial  and easily corrected  In the Southern States it is incorporated in the whole system      Jefferson accepted the consensus of his time that Africans were an inferior race  However  a section on slavery was included in his first draft of the Declaration of Independence  where he stated    The King  has waged cruel war against human nature itself  violating its most sacred rights of life   liberty in the persons of distant people who never offended him  captivating   carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere  or to incur miserable death in their transportation hither     This section of the Declaration was omitted because it alarmed southerners  who did not agree with such a bold statement and northerners who feared the disagreement on the matter would endanger a united front against Britain    In his Notes on the State of Virginia  1785   he expressed a  strong suspicion  that the Negro was inferior to whites in both the endowments of body and mind but wasn t sure if it was because they were a  distinct race  or were so because of  time and circumstances      Historians have generally described Jefferson as a benevolent slaveowner        though some historians have expressed doubts    Jefferson did not allow his slaves to be overworked and gave them Sundays  Christmas and Easter off      According to a former Monticello slave  slaves were seldom punished except for stealing  fighting or other serious offenses  though there were some cases of excessive whippings at the hands of overseers      Slaves were provided with log cabins with a fireplace  good clothing and food and were allowed to have their own gardens and raise chickens which  along with eggs and produce  were sold by more than half the adult slaves to the Jefferson household     As previously noted  President Jefferson called for outlawing the trans Atlantic slave trade  and he signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves into law    Southern contemporary critics viewed Jefferson as opposed to slavery for his Notes on the State of Virginia   his letter to Benjamin Banneker in 1791  and his reference to St  George Tucker s federal plan to purchase and free slaves     Although Jefferson owned many slaves during his life  it is widely held that he was opposed to the institution of slavery on moral and practical grounds    He made several attempts to advance legislation to abolish slavery  and later proposed colonization of freed slaves to an independent country of their own in Liberia       In 1779 he proposed a plan of gradual voluntary training  sponsorship and resettlement for slave families to the Virginia legislature  Three years hence he helped draft legislation to enable owners to free    manumit    slaves  owners would only need a written manumission  whereas owners previously had to pay to transport their slave out of state  and the slave could only be freed for doing an act of public service  or with permission from the commonwealth    Jefferson proposed to the Congress legislation in 1784 that would end slavery in the Western Territories in the year 1800  however  this legislation was defeated by one vote  In 1787  Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance  a partial victory for Jefferson that terminated slavery in the North West Territory  Much of Virginia society  as proven by Robert Carter  s slave emancipation in 1791  was strongly opposed to freed slaves becoming citizens  while their colonization was viewed as an alternative  Following the Gabriel Prosser rebellion in the summer of 1800  Jefferson again proposed a colonization plan for freed slaves to prevent a race war    Colonization became popular throughout the early 19th Century  While President  he attempted to colonize emancipated Virginia slaves to Sierra Leone off the coast of Africa through British and Portugal companies but these efforts were unsuccessful    The idea of recolonization was met with mixed reactions from proponents and critics among different political and religious groups     While Jefferson on occasion had expressed reservations about releasing unprepared slaves into freedom  it was something he had sought according to his main overseer of slaves  Edmund Bacon and his slave Joseph Fossett  Jefferson freed five slaves in his will providing a monetary endowment and trade tools to aid in making a living  Jefferson also successfully petitioned the Virginia legislature to allow freed slaves to remain in Virginia  His encumbered debt from an agricultural depression and the mortgaging of his slaves legally prevented him from freeing the remaining slaves who were later auctioned locally by his heirs to pay his creditors and avoid their confiscation       The claim that Thomas Jefferson fathered children by his slave  Sally Hemings   has been a matter of debate since 1802  That year journalist James T  Callender   after being denied a position as postmaster by Jefferson  published allegations that Jefferson had taken Hemings as a concubine and had fathered several children with her    John Wayles  her father and slavemaster  was also the father of Jefferson s wife Martha  Hemings was three quarters white and strikingly similar in looks and voice to Jefferson s late wife     In 1998  in order to establish the male DNA line  a panel of researchers conducted a Y DNA study of living descendants of Jefferson s uncle  Field  and of a descendant of Hemings  son  Eston Hemings   The results  published in the journal Nature     showed a Y DNA match with the male Jefferson line  In 2000  the Thomas Jefferson Foundation  TJF  assembled a team of historians whose report concluded that  together with the DNA and historic evidence  there was a high probability that Jefferson was the father of Eston and likely of all Hemings  children  W  M  Wallenborn who worked on the Monticello report disagreed  claiming the committee s report was a  rush to judgement   and that the claims of Jefferson s paternity were unsubstantiated and politically driven     Since the DNA tests were made public most biographers and historians have concluded that the widower Jefferson had a long term relationship with Hemings    Other scholars  including a team of professors associated with the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society  maintain that the evidence is insufficient to prove Jefferson s paternity conclusively  and note the possibility that other family members  including his brother Randolph Jefferson and his five sons  who often fraternized with slaves  could have fathered Hemings  children       Hemings  first child was conceived while she and Jefferson were in France during his term as US Ambassador  The claim has been made that since slavery had been abolished in France  Hemings only agreed to come home with Jefferson on condition that their children would be freed at the age of 2  and that Jefferson kept this promise    However  there is no written record or oral history of a claim by Hemings that Jefferson fathered any of her children    Jefferson freed two slaves of the extended Hemings family in the 18th century  He allowed two of her children to leave Monticello without formal manumission when they came of age  Five other slaves  including the two remaining sons of Hemings  were freed by his will upon his death  Although not freed in Jefferson s will  Hemings herself was freed by Jefferson s daughter  Martha Jefferson Randolph after his death    She then left Monticello with her sons and they were counted as free whites in the 1830 census     Although Jefferson generally referred to himself as a Christian  by 1764 he had withdrawn from an  orthodox  Christian belief after his personal scrutiny of New Testament teachings found intolerable inconsistencies  Jefferson later wrote that he found two strains within the Bible  one that was as  diamonds  of the  purest moral teaching     and another that was as a  dunghill  of  priestcraft and roguery      In 1777  Jefferson drafted Virginia s An Act of Establishing Religious Freedom   Submitted in 1779  the Act was ratified in 1786 by the Virginia legislature  The Act made it unlawful to compel men to attend or donate money to religious establishments  and declared that men  shall be free to profess  and by argument to maintain  their opinions in matters of religion      Jefferson initially supported restrictions banning clergy from holding public office  however  later in life he changed this view  believing the clergy had the same rights as others to hold public office     Jefferson praised the morality of Jesus and edited a compilation of his teachings  omitting the miracles and supernatural references of the biblical account  and titling it The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth     This book is now known as the Jefferson Bible   He claimed that Christianity possessed   the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man     He was firmly anticlerical   saying that in  every country and every age  the priest has been hostile to liberty    they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon  unintelligible to all mankind  and therefore the safer for their purposes      Jefferson s personalized Christianity included a strict code of moral conduct and was inspired by classical literature    His belief system retained some Christian principles but rejected many of the orthodox tenets of that time and was critical of the Catholic Church as he had observed it in France  He advanced the idea of Separation of Church and State   that the government should not have an official religion nor should it prohibit any particular religious expression  He initially offered these thoughts in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists in Connecticut    In a private letter to Benjamin Rush in 1803 he explained some aspects of his personal belief system regarding Christianity   To the corruptions of Christianity I am  indeed  opposed  but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself  I am a Christian  in the only sense in which he wished any one to be  sincerely attached to his doctrines  in preference to all others  ascribing to himself every human excellence        Jefferson noted both benevolence and contradictions in Christian doctrine    In an 1820 letter to his close friend William Short   he stated   it is not to be understood that I am with him  Jesus  in all his doctrines  I am a Materialist   he takes the side of Spiritualism  he preaches the efficacy of repentance toward forgiveness of sin  I require a counterpoise of good works to redeem it   In 1824  four years later  Jefferson had changed on his view of the  materialism  of Jesus  clarifying then that     the founder of our religion  was unquestionably a materialist as to man      As a landowner Jefferson played a role in governing his local Episcopal Church   When he was home he attended the Episcopal church and raised his daughters in that faith      Some have described him as a Deist   however  due to his belief in a God which is actively involved in the guidance of human history    this does not sufficiently define his beliefs     Jefferson was a farmer  with a keen curiosity in new crops  soil conditions  garden designs and scientific agricultural techniques  His main cash crop was tobacco  but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable  He tried to achieve self sufficiency with wheat  vegetables  flax  corn  hogs  sheep  poultry and cattle to supply his family  slaves  and employees  but he had cash flow problems and was always in debt       In the field of architecture  Jefferson helped popularize the Neo Palladian style in the United States through designs for the Virginia State Capitol in addition to the University of Virginia and his own home  among others      He was interested in birds and wine  and was a noted gourmet   he was also a prolific writer and linguist  and spoke several languages    As a naturalist  he was compelled to purchase the Natural Bridge      Jefferson had a lifelong interest in linguistics   could read and write in a number of languages and was fluent in several  including Greek  Italian  French and German  He claimed to have taught himself Spanish in nineteen days  using only a grammar guide and a copy of Don Quixote   though colleagues were skeptical  John Quincy Adams dismissed Jefferson s account as one of the exaggerative  large stories  he was inclined to tell    He also collected and understood a number of American Indian vocabularies and instructed Lewis and Clark to record and collect various Indian dialects during their Expedition    He studied the ancient Anglo Saxon language in a linguistic and philosophical capacity  In his early years he excelled in classical language while at boarding school   where he received a classical education in Greek and Latin   and was known to keep his Greek grammar book with him everywhere he went  He later came to regard the Greek language as the  perfect language  as expressed in its laws   consequently becoming keenly interested in linguistics and political philosophy altogether  While attending the College of William   Mary he taught himself Italian    Here Jefferson first became familiar with the Anglo Saxon language  especially as it was associated with English Common law and system of government  He was so interested in the subject that  while pursuing law  he set aside time to devote to its study  as the college offered no such curriculum   Linguistics played a significant role in how Jefferson modeled and expressed political and philosophical ideas  He believed that the progression of language provided a good model for the advancement of political thought  that change in language was the result of common sense  natural law and consequently public acceptance and usage    He understood the study of ancient languages was essential in understanding the roots of modern language  While criticizing the British for not recognizing various colonial dialects  Jefferson wanted the English language largely left intact  and taught that way to American school children    He owned a wide variety of multiple language dictionaries  including Webster s A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language   1806    Much of Jefferson s correspondence is earmarked with Greek and Latin quotations and other references to language      Jefferson later included Italian and Anglo Saxon among the languages taught at the University of Virginia       Although his political career and private activities required him to speak in public and his writing on a wide range of topics was regarded as brilliant  Jefferson was not known as a good orator and preferred to remain silent if possible  Instead of delivering his State of the Union addresses himself  Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress  This started a tradition which continued until 1913  when Woodrow Wilson chose to deliver his own State of the Union address     Jefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions  These include the design for a revolving book stand to hold five volumes at once to be viewed by the reader  Another was the  Great Clock   powered by the Earth s gravitational pull on Revolutionary War cannonballs  Louis Leschot  a machinist  aided Jefferson with the clock  Jefferson invented a 6in  15cm  long coded wooden cipher wheel mounted on a metal spindle  to keep State Department messages secure  while he was Secretary of State  The messages were scrambled and unscrambled by 26 alphabet letters on each circular segment of the wheel  He improved the moldboard plow   an idea he never patented and gave to posterity    and the polygraph   in collaboration with Charles Willson Peale     As Minister to France  Jefferson was impressed by France s military standardization program known as the Systme Gribeauval   As president  he initiated a program at the Federal Armories to develop interchangeable parts for firearms  He made improvements and introduced innovations on an English printing press he had brought back with him  He also improved the pedometer   a device for counting the number of steps taken while walking  and gave one to James Madison  For Jefferson s inventiveness and ingenuity he received several Honorary Doctor of Law degrees    Jefferson can also be accredited as the creator of the swivel chair   the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence      Jefferson has been memorialized with buildings  sculptures  postage and currency  The Jefferson Memorial was dedicated in Washington  D C  in 1943  on the 200th anniversary of Jefferson s birth  The interior of the memorial includes a 19 foot  6m  statue of Jefferson and engravings of passages from his writings  Most prominent are the words inscribed around the monument near the roof   I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man     During the New Deal era of the 1930s  Democrats honored Jefferson and Andrew Jackson as their party s founding fathers and continued inspiration  He was portrayed by them as the spokesman for democracy and the common man  President Franklin D  Roosevelt led the effort to gain approvals for his monument in Washington     Jefferson has been honored on U S  postage since the first Jefferson postage stamp was released in 1856  Jefferson was the second president to be featured on U S  Postage     His portrait appears on the U S   2 bill   nickel   and the  100 Series EE Savings Bond   and a Presidential Dollar which released into circulation on August 16  2007     His original tombstone  now a cenotaph   is located on the campus in the University of Missouri  s Quadrangle   A life mask of Jefferson was created by John Henri Isaac Browere in the 1820s     Jefferson  together with George Washington  Theodore Roosevelt   and Abraham Lincoln   was chosen by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and approved by President Calvin Coolidge to be depicted in stone at the Mount Rushmore Memorial      Other memorials to Jefferson include the commissioning of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship Thomas Jefferson in Norfolk   Virginia on July 8  2003  in commemoration of his establishment of a Survey of the Coast  the predecessor to NOAA s National Ocean Service  A bronze monument to Jefferson was erected in Jefferson Park  Chicago along Milwaukee Avenue in 2005  In honor of Jefferson s support  the Library of Congress  website for legislative information is named THOMAS    ", "Bush": "Early years World War II Marriage and

1943    The following year  his squadron was based on the USS San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51  where his lanky physique earned him the nickname  Skin     During this time  the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II  the Battle of the Philippine Sea      After Bush s promotion to Lieutenant  junior grade  on August 1  1944  the San Jacinto commenced operations against the Japanese in the Bonin Islands   Bush piloted one of four Grumman TBM Avenger aircraft from VT 51 that attacked the Japanese installations on Chichijima     His crew for the mission  which occurred on September 2  1944  included Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lieutenant Junior Grade William White    During their attack  the Avengers encountered intense anti aircraft fire  Bush s aircraft was hit by flak and his engine caught on fire  Despite his plane being on fire  Bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target  scoring several damaging hits    With his engine ablaze  Bush flew several miles from the island  where he and one other crew member on the TBM Avenger bailed out of the aircraft    the other man s parachute did not open    Bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft  while several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the lifeguard submarine USS Finback     For the next month he remained on the Finback   and participated in the rescue of other pilots  Several of those shot down during the attack were executed and eaten by their captors     Bush subsequently returned to San Jacinto in November 1944 and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the United States  Through 1944  he flew 58 combat missions   for which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross   three Air Medals   and the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to San Jacinto      Because of his valuable combat experience  Bush was reassigned to Norfolk Navy Base and put in a training wing for new torpedo pilots  He was later assigned as a naval aviator in a new torpedo squadron  VT 153  based at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile   Michigan  Upon the Japanese surrender in 1945  Bush was honorably discharged in September of that year   George Bush married Barbara Pierce on January 6  1945  only weeks after his return from the Pacific  The couple s first residence was a small rented apartment in Trenton   Michigan  near Bush s Navy assignment at NAS Grosse Ile   Their marriage produced six children  George Walker Bush  born 1946   Pauline Robinson  Robin  Bush  19491953  died of leukemia    John Ellis  Jeb  Bush  born 1953   Neil Mallon Bush  born 1955   Marvin Pierce Bush  born 1956   and Dorothy Bush Koch  born 1959      Bush had been accepted to Yale University prior to his enlistment in the military  and took up the offer after his discharge and marriage    While at Yale  he was enrolled in an accelerated program that allowed him to graduate in two and a half years  rather than four    He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and was elected its president    He also captained the Yale baseball team  and as a left handed first baseman   played in the first two College World Series     As the team captain  Bush met Babe Ruth before a game during his senior year  He was also  like his father  a member of the Yale cheerleading squad    Late in his junior year he was  like his father Prescott Bush  1917   initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society   He graduated as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa from Yale in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics     After graduating from Yale  Bush moved his young family to West Texas   His father s business connections proved useful as he ventured into the oil business  starting as a sales clerk with Dresser Industries   a subsidiary of Brown Brothers Harriman  where Prescott Bush had served on the board of directors for 22 years     While working for Dresser  Bush lived in various places with his family  Odessa  Texas   Ventura   Bakersfield and Compton  California   and Midland  Texas      According to eldest son George W  Bush   then age two  the family lived in one of the few duplexes in Odessa with an indoor bathroom  which they  shared with a couple of hookers      Bush started the Bush Overbey Oil Development company in 1951 and in 1953 co founded the Zapata Petroleum Corporation   an oil company that drilled in the Permian Basin in Texas    In 1954 he was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company  a subsidiary which specialized in offshore drilling    In 1959  shortly after the subsidiary became independent  Bush moved the company and his family from Midland to Houston     He continued serving as president of the company until 1964  and later chairman until 1966  but his ambitions turned political    By that time  Bush had become a millionaire     Bush served as Chairman of the Republican Party for Harris County  Texas   in 1964  but wanted to be more involved in policy making  so he set his sights high  he aimed for a U S  Senate seat from Texas    After winning the Republican primary  Bush faced his opponent  incumbent Democrat Ralph W  Yarborough   who attacked Bush as a right wing extremist  and Bush lost the general election  The Republican candidate for governor   Jack Crichton of Dallas   a Louisiana native who often campaigned alongside Bush before the election  lost by a much wider margin to Governor John B  Connally Jr    It was suggested in PBS s  American Experience  episode about Bush that he and the Harris County Republicans played a role in the development of the New Republican Party of the late 20th century  First  Bush worked to absorb the John Birch Society members  who were trying to take over the Republican Party and lead it towards a more anti Communist direction  Second  during and after the Civil Rights Movement   Democrats in the South who were committed to segregation left their party  and although the  country club Republicans  had differing ideological beliefs  they found common ground in hoping to expel the Democrats from power     Bush was elected in 1966 to a House of Representatives seat from the 7th District of Texas  defeating with 57 percent of the ballots cast the Democrat Frank Briscoe   the district attorney of Harris County known for his law and order credentials and a cousin of later Governor Dolph Briscoe       Bush was the first Republican to represent Houston in the U S  House    Bush s representative district included Tanglewood   the Houston neighborhood that was his residence    his family had moved into Tanglewood in the 1960s    His voting record in the House was generally conservative   Bush voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968   although it was generally unpopular in his district  He supported the Nixon administration  s Vietnam policies   but broke with Republicans on the issue of birth control   which he supported    Despite being a first term congressman  Bush was appointed to the powerful House Ways and Means Committee   where he voted to abolish the military draft     He was elected to a second term in 1968     In 1970 Nixon convinced Bush to relinquish his House seat to run for the Senate against Ralph Yarborough  a fierce Nixon critic  In the Republican primary  Bush easily defeated conservative Robert J  Morris   by a margin of 87 6  to 12 4     Nixon came to Texas to campaign in Longview for Bush and gubernatorial candidate Paul Eggers   a Dallas lawyer who was a close friend of U S  Senator John G  Tower     Former Congressman Lloyd Bentsen   a more moderate Democrat and native of Mission in south Texas  defeated Yarborough in the Democratic primary    Yarborough endorsed Bentsen  who defeated Bush  53 4 to 46 6     As Bush s political career waned  he moved out of Houston and sold his first Tanglewood house  but for periods of time continued to reside in Tanglewood     Following his 1970 loss  Bush was well known as a prominent Republican businessman from the   Sun Belt    a group of states in the Southern part of the country    Nixon noticed and appreciated the sacrifice Bush had made of his Congressional position    so he appointed him Ambassador to the United Nations     He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate  and served for two years  beginning in 1971     Amidst the Watergate scandal   Nixon asked Bush to become chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973    Bush accepted  and held this position when the popularity of both Nixon and the Republican Party plummeted    He defended Nixon steadfastly  but later as Nixon s complicity became clear  Bush focused more on defending the Republican Party  while still maintaining loyalty to Nixon  As chairman  Bush formally requested that Nixon eventually resign for the good of the Republican party    Nixon did this on August 9  1974  Bush noted in his diary that  There was an aura of sadness  like somebody died     The  resignation  speech was vintage Nixona kick or two at the pressenormous strains  One couldn t help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame      President Gerald Ford s swearing in offered  indeed a new spirit  a new lift      Gerald Ford   Nixon s successor  appointed Bush to be Chief of the U S  Liaison Office in the People s Republic of China  Since the United States at the time maintained official relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and not the People s Republic of China  the Liaison Office did not have the official status of an embassy and Bush did not formally hold the position of  ambassador   though he unofficially acted as one  The 14 months that he spent in China were largely seen as beneficial for U S  China relations      After Ford s accession to the presidency  Bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as Vice President  Ford eventually narrowed his list to Nelson Rockefeller and Bush  White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld reportedly preferred Rockefeller over Bush  Rockefeller was finally named and confirmed     Bush was again passed over for the vice presidency by Ford when the president chose Bush s future presidential rival  Senator Bob Dole   to replace Rockefeller on the 1976 presidential ticket   In 1976 Ford brought Bush back to Washington to become Director of Central Intelligence  DCI   replacing William Colby     He served in this role for 357 days  from January 30  1976  to January 20  1977    The CIA had been rocked by a series of revelations  including those based on investigations by the Church Committee regarding illegal and unauthorized activities by the CIA   and Bush was credited with helping to restore the agency s morale    In his capacity as DCI  Bush gave national security briefings to Jimmy Carter both as a Presidential candidate and as President elect  and discussed the possibility of remaining in that position in a Carter administration    but did not do so  He was succeeded by Deputy Director of Central Intelligence E  Henry Knoche   who served as acting Director of Central Intelligence until Stansfield Turner was confirmed     After a Democratic administration took power in 1977  Bush became chairman on the Executive Committee of the First International Bank in Houston    He later spent a year as a part time professor of Administrative Science at Rice University  s Jones School of Business beginning in 1978  the year it opened  Bush said of his time there   I loved my brief time in the world of academia     Between 1977 and 1979  he was a director of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization     Bush had decided in the late 1970s that he was going to run for president in 1980  in 1979  he attended 850 political events and traveled more than 250 000 miles  400 000km  to campaign for the nation s highest office  In the contest for the Republican Party nomination  Bush stressed his wide range of government experience  while competing against rivals Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee  Senator Bob Dole of Kansas  Congressman John Anderson of Illinois  who would later run as an independent   Congressman Phil Crane   also of Illinois  former Governor John Connally of Texas  and the front runner Ronald Reagan   former actor  and Governor of California      In the primary election  Bush focused almost entirely on the Iowa caucuses   while Reagan ran a more traditional campaign  Bush represented the centrist wing in the GOP  whereas Reagan represented conservatives  Bush famously labeled Reagan s supply side  influenced plans for massive tax cuts   voodoo economics    His strategy proved useful  to some degree  as he won in Iowa with 31 5  to Reagan s 29 4   After the win  Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum  or  Big Mo   As a result of the loss  Reagan replaced his campaign manager   reorganized his staff  and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary   The two men agreed to a debate in the state  organized by the Nashua Telegraph   but paid for by the Reagan campaign  Reagan invited the other four candidates as well  but Bush refused to debate them  and eventually they left  The debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign  when the moderator  John Breen  ordered Reagan s microphone turned off  his angry response   I am paying for this microphone   struck a chord with the public  Bush ended up losing New Hampshire s primary with 23  to Reagan s 50   Bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well  and formally dropped out of the race in May of that year     With his political future seeming dismal  Bush sold his house in Houston and bought his grandfather s estate in Kennebunkport   Maine  known as  Walker s Point     At the Republican Convention   Reagan selected Bush as his Vice Presidential nominee  placing him on the winning Republican presidential ticket of 1980    As Vice President  Bush generally took on a low profile while recognizing the constitutional limits of the office  he avoided decision making or criticizing Reagan in any way  As had become customary  he and his wife moved into the Vice President s residence at Number One Observatory Circle   about two miles from the White House   After selling the house in the Tanglewood   the Bushes declared a room in The Houstonian Hotel in Houston as their official voting address    The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions  including many state funerals   which became a common joke for comedians  Mrs  Bush found the funerals largely beneficial  saying   George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended  enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan   As the President of the Senate   Bush stayed in contact with members of Congress  and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill     On March 30  1981  early into the administration  Reagan was shot and seriously wounded in Washington  D C  Bush  second in command by the presidential line of succession   was in Fort Worth   Texas  and flew back to Washington immediately  Reagan s cabinet convened in the White House Situation Room   where they discussed various issues  including the availability of the Nuclear Football   When Bush s plane landed  his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter  as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack  Bush rejected the idea  responding   Only the President lands on the South Lawn     This made a positive impression on Reagan    who recovered and returned to work within two weeks  From then on  the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the Oval Office    In December 1983 Bush flew to El Salvador and warned that country s military leaders to end their death squads and hold fully free elections or face the loss of U S  aid  Bush s aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace of lvaro Magaa   Bush was never told of the aides  concerns and a tense meeting was held in which some of Magaa s personnel brandished semiautomatic weapons and refused requests to take them outside     Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces  on deregulation and international drug smuggling  The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules  making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise  in order to curb the size of the federal government  The drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the United States  Both were popular issues with conservatives  and Bush  largely a moderate  began courting them through his work     Reagan and Bush ran for reelection in 1984   The Democratic opponent  Walter Mondale   made history by choosing a woman as his running mate  New York Representative Geraldine Ferraro   She and Bush squared off in a single televised Vice Presidential debate     Serving as a contrast to the Ivy League educated Bush  Ferraro represented a   blue collar   district in Queens   New York  this  coupled with her popularity among female journalists  left Bush at a disadvantage  The Reagan Bush ticket won in a landslide against the Mondale Ferraro ticket  Early into his second term as Vice President  Bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in 1988  By the end of 1985  a committee had been established and over two million dollars raised for Bush     Bush became the first Vice President to serve as Acting President when  on July 13  1985  Reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon   making Bush acting president for approximately eight hours   The Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal in 1986  when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran  and had used the proceeds to fund the anticommunist Contras in Nicaragua  a direct violation of the law  When the Iran Contra Affair   as it became known  broke to the media  Bush  like Reagan  stated that he had been  out of the loop  and unaware of the diversion of funds    although this was later questioned    His diaries from that time stated  I m one of the few people that know fully the details     Ailes and others were concerned that Bush was seen as a  wimp   an image put to rest by his evident fury in an interview with Dan Rather      As Vice President  Bush officially opened the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis    In 1988 the U S  accidentally shot down Iran Air Flight 655 killing 290 passengers  Bush said that he would  never apologize for the United States of America  Ever  I dont care what the facts are      In the January 26  1987  issue of Time magazine   in an article entitled  Where Is the Real George Bush   journalist Robert Ajemian reported that a friend of Bush s had urged him to spend several days at Camp David thinking through his plans for his prospective presidency  to which Bush is said to have responded in exasperation   Oh  the vision thing      This oft cited quote became a shorthand for the charge that Bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner  The phrase has since become a metonym for any politician s failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign  and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures     Bush had been planning a presidential run since as early as 1985  and entered the Republican primary for President of the United States in October 1987    His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U S  Senator Bob Dole of Kansas   U S  Representative Jack Kemp of New York  former Governor Pete DuPont of Delaware   and conservative Christian televangelist Pat Robertson    Though considered the early frontrunner for the nomination  Bush came in third in the Iowa caucus  behind winner Dole and runner up Robertson    Much like Reagan did in 1980  Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary    With Dole ahead in New Hampshire  Bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser    he rebounded to win the state s primary  Following the primary  Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance  when the interviewer asked Dole if he had anything to say to Bush  Dole said  in response to the ads   yeah  stop lying about my record  in an angry tone  This is thought to have hurt Dole s campaign to Bush s benefit  Bush continued seeing victory  winning many Southern primaries as well    Once the multiple state primaries such as Super Tuesday began  Bush s organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match  and the nomination was his     Leading up to the 1988 Republican National Convention   there was much speculation as to Bush s choice of running mate  Bush chose little known U S  Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana   favored by conservatives  Despite Reagan s popularity  Bush trailed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis   then Governor of Massachusetts   in most polls     Bush  occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan  delivered a well received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention  Known as the   thousand points of light   speech  it described Bush s vision of America  he endorsed the Pledge of Allegiance   prayer in schools   capital punishment   gun rights   and opposed abortion     The speech at the convention included Bush s famous pledge    Read my lips  no new taxes       The general election campaign between the two men has been described as one of the nastiest in modern times    Bush blamed Dukakis for polluting the Boston Harbor as the Massachusetts governor     Bush also pointed out that Dukakis was opposed to the law that would require all students to say the Pledge of Allegiance   a topic well covered in Bush s nomination acceptance speech     Dukakis s unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates  Moderator Bernard Shaw asked Dukakis if Dukakis would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife  Kitty   were raped and murdered    Dukakis s response of no  as well as a provocative ad about convicted felon Willie Horton   contributed toward Bush s characterization of Dukakis as  soft on crime      Bush defeated Dukakis and his running mate  Lloyd Bentsen   in the Electoral College   by 426 to 111  Bentsen received one vote from a faithless elector      In the nationwide popular vote  Bush took 53 4  of the ballots cast while Dukakis received 45 6     Bush became the first serving Vice President to be elected President since Martin Van Buren in 1836 as well as the first person to succeed someone from his own party to the Presidency via election to the office in his own right since Herbert Hoover in 1929     Bush was inaugurated on January 20  1989  succeeding Ronald Reagan  He entered office at a period of change in the world  the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Soviet Union came early in his presidency    He ordered military operations in Panama and the Persian Gulf   and  at one point  was recorded as having a record high approval rating of 89     Economic recession and breaking his   no new taxes   pledge caused a sharp decline in his approval rating  and Bush lost the 1992 election      In his Inaugural Address  Bush said   I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise  We live in a peaceful  prosperous time  but we can make it better  For a new breeze is blowing  and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn  for in man s heart  if not in fact  the day of the dictator is over  The totalitarian era is passing  its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient  lifeless tree  A new breeze is blowing  and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on  There is new ground to be broken  and new action to be taken     Early in his term  Bush faced the problem of what to do with leftover deficits spawned by the Reagan years  At  220billion in 1990  the deficit had grown to three times its size since 1980  Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit  believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so  He began an effort to persuade the Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget  with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending   and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes   Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building     In the wake of a struggle with Congress  Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues  as a result  many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised  no new taxes  in his 1988 campaign  Perceiving a means of revenge  Republican congressmen defeated Bush s proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by  500billion over five years  Scrambling  Bush accepted the Democrats  demands for higher taxes and more spending  which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp decrease in popularity   Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill    Near the end of the 101st Congress   the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high income taxpayers  Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax   Bush relented on this issue as well  This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency  his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered     Coming at around the same time as the budget deal  America entered into a mild recession  lasting for six months  Many government programs  such as welfare  increased    As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991  Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers    The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations  which laid off a substantial number of workers  Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents  who had believed that their jobs were secure   By his second year in office  Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy  as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection  By 1992  interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years  but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7 8   the highest since 1984  In September 1992  the Census Bureau reported that 14 2  of all Americans lived in poverty     At a press conference in 1990  Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable     During a speech to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing  Bush announced a vision to complete Space Station Freedom   resume exploration of the Moon and begin exploration of Mars     Although a space station was eventually constructedwork on the International Space Station began in 1998other work has been confounded by NASA budgetary issues  In 1998  Bush received the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement s National Space Trophy for his pioneering leadership of the U S  space program   Bush signed a number of major laws in his presidency  including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990   this was one of the most pro  civil rights bills in decades  He is also the only President to successfully veto a civil rights act  having vetoed the job discrimination protection Civil Rights Act of 1990     Bush feared racial quotas would be imposed  but later approved watered down Civil Rights Act of 1991     He worked to increase federal spending for education  childcare  and advanced technology research  He also signed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act which provides monetary compensation of people who were contracted cancer and a number of other specified diseases disease as a direct result of their exposure to atmospheric nuclear testing undertaken by the United States during the Cold War   or their exposure to high levels of radon while doing uranium mining   In dealing with the environment  Bush reauthorized the Clean Air Act   requiring cleaner burning fuels  He quarreled with Congress over an eventually signed bill to aid police in capturing criminals  and signed into law a measure to improve the nation s highway system    Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990     which led to a 40 percent increase in legal immigration to the United States      Bush became a life member of the National Rifle Association early in 1988 and had campaigned as a  pro gun  candidate with the NRA s endorsement    In March 1989  he placed a temporary ban on the import of certain semiautomatic rifles    This action cost him endorsement from the NRA in 1992  Bush publicly resigned his life membership in the organization after receiving a form letter from NRA depicting agents of the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  and Firearms as  jack booted thugs   He called the NRA letter a  vicious slander on good people      President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America s most serious social problems  He often used the   thousand points of light   theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems  In his 1989 inaugural address  President Bush said   I have spoken of a thousand points of light  of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation  doing good      Four years later in his report to the nation on The Points of Light Movement  President Bush said   Points of Light are the soul of America  They are ordinary people who reach beyond themselves to touch the lives of those in need  bringing hope and opportunity  care and friendship  By giving so generously of themselves  these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what all of us are called to become      In 1990 the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of volunteerism     In 2007  the Points of Light Foundation merged with the Hands On Network with the goal of strengthening volunteerism  streamlining costs and services and deepening impact    Points of Light   the organization created through this merger  has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world  In 2012  Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth  635 million     On October 16  2009  President Barack Obama held a Presidential Forum on Service hosted by former President George H  W  Bush and Points of Light at the George Bush Presidential Library Center on the campus of Texas A M University   The event celebrated the contributions of more than 4 500 Daily Point of Light award winners and honored President Bush s legacy of service and civic engagement     In 2011 Points of Light paid tribute to President George H  W  Bush and volunteer service at Washington  D C  s Kennedy Center   President Bush was joined by Presidents Jimmy Carter   Bill Clinton   and George W  Bush to highlight the role volunteer service plays in people s lives     President Bush created the Daily Point of Light Award in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems  The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations  both to honor them for their tremendous work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts  By the end of his administration  President Bush had recognized 1 020 Daily Points of Light representing all 50 states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for the homeless     The Daily Point of Light continues to be awarded by Points of Light and President Bush continues to sign all of the awards     On July 15  2013  President Barack Obama welcomed President Bush to the White House to celebrate the 5 000th Daily Point of Light Award    They bestowed the award on Floyd Hammer and Kathy Hamilton of Union  Iowa   for their work founding Outreach  a nonprofit that delivers free meals to hungry children in 15 countries     Bush appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States    In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments  Bush appointed 42 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 148 judges to the United States district courts   Among these appointments was Vaughn R  Walker   who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge    Bush also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies   as 11 nominees for 10 federal appellate judgeships were not processed by the Democrat  controlled Senate Judiciary Committee      In the 1980s  Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega   a once U S  supportive leader who was later accused of spying for Fidel Castro and using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States  was one of the most recognizable names in America and was constantly in the press  The struggle to remove him from power began in the Reagan administration  when economic sanctions were imposed on the country  this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing  56million in Panamanian funds in American banks  Reagan sent more than 2 000 American troops to Panama as well    Unlike Reagan  Bush was able to remove Noriega from power  but his administration s unsuccessful post invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government     In May 1989  Panama held democratic elections  in which Guillermo Endara was elected president  the results were then annulled by Noriega s government  In response  Bush sent 2 000 more troops to the country  where they began conducting regular military exercises in Panamanian territory  in violation of prior treaties   Bush then removed an embassy and ambassador from the country  and dispatched additional troops to Panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion    Noriega suppressed an October military coup attempt and massive protests in Panama against him  but after a U S  serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989  Bush ordered 24 000 troops into the country with an objective of removing Noriega from power     Operation Just Cause  was a large scale American military operation  and the first in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War     The mission was controversial  but American forces achieved control of the country and Endara assumed the Presidency    Noriega surrendered to the United States and was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992    President Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush visited Panama in June 1992  to give support to the first post invasion Panamanian government   In 1989  just after the fall of the Berlin Wall   Bush met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in a conference on the Mediterranean island of Malta   The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets  but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction  General Brent Scowcroft   among others  was apprehensive about the meeting  saying that it might be  premature  due to concerns where  according to Condoleezza Rice    expectations  would be  set that something was going to happen  where the Soviets might grandstand and force  the U S   into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States   But European leaders  including Franois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher   encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev    something that he did December 2 and 3  1989    Though no agreements were signed  the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one  when asked about nuclear war  Gorbachev responded   I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America  And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation     This is just the beginning  We are just at the very beginning of our road  long road to a long lasting  peaceful period     The meeting was received as a very important step to the end of the Cold War     Another summit was held in July 1991  where the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  START I  was signed by Bush and Gorbachev in Moscow  The treaty took nine years in the making and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of the Intermediate Ranged Nuclear Forces Treaty by Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987  The contentions in START would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the USSR by about 35  over seven years  and the Soviet Union s land based intercontinental ballistic missiles would be cut by 50   Bush described START as  a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust     After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991  President Bush and Gorbachev declared a U S  Russian strategic partnership  marking the end of the Cold War    On August 2  1990  Iraq  led by Saddam Hussein   invaded its oil rich neighbor to the south  Kuwait   Bush condemned the invasion   and began rallying opposition to Iraq in the US and among European  Asian  and Middle Eastern allies    Secretary of Defense Richard Bruce  Dick  Cheney traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Fahd   Fahd requested US military aid in the matter  fearing a possible invasion of his country as well    The request was met initially with Air Force fighter jets  Iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal that would allow the country to take control of half of Kuwait  Bush rejected this proposal and insisted on a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces    The planning of a ground operation by US led coalition forces began forming in September 1990  headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf     Bush spoke before a joint session of the U S  Congress regarding the authorization of air and land attacks  laying out four immediate objectives   Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely  immediately  and without condition  Kuwait s legitimate government must be restored  The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured  And American citizens abroad must be protected   He then outlined a fifth  long term objective   Out of these troubled times  our fifth objective  a new world order  can emerge  a new era  freer from the threat of terror  stronger in the pursuit of justice  and more secure in the quest for peace  An era in which the nations of the world  East and West  North and South  can prosper and live in harmony     A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle  A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice  A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak     With the United Nations Security Council opposed to Iraq s violence  Congress authorized the use of Military force   with a set goal of returning control of Kuwait to the Kuwaiti government  and protecting America s interests abroad     Early on the morning of January 17  1991  allied forces launched the first attack  which included more than 4 000 bombing runs by coalition aircraft  This pace would continue for the next four weeks  until a ground invasion was launched on February 24  1991  Allied forces penetrated Iraqi lines and pushed toward Kuwait City while on the west side of the country  forces were intercepting the retreating Iraqi army  Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours  Critics labeled this decision premature  as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape  Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U S  casualties  Opponents further charged that Bush should have continued the attack  pushing Hussein s army back to Baghdad  then removing him from power    Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have  incurred incalculable human and political costs     We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and  in effect  rule Iraq      Bush s approval ratings skyrocketed after the successful offensive    Additionally  President Bush and Secretary of State Baker felt the coalition victory had increased U S  prestige abroad and believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the coalition victory to revitalize the Arab Israeli peace process  The administration immediately returned to Arab Israeli peacemaking following the end of the Gulf War  this resulted in the Madrid Conference   later in 1991     Faced with a humanitarian disaster in Somalia   exacerbated by a complete breakdown in civil order  the United Nations had created the UNOSOM I mission in April 1992 to aid the situation through humanitarian efforts  though the mission failed    The Bush administration proposed American aid to the region by assisting in creating a secure environment for humanitarian efforts and UN Resolution 794 was unanimously adopted by the Security Council on December 3  1992    A lame duck president  Bush launched Operation Restore Hope the following day under which the United States would assume command in accordance with Resolution 794    Fighting would escalate and continue into the Clinton administration     Bush s administration  along with the Progressive Conservative Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney   spearheaded the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   which would eliminate the majority of tariffs on products traded among the United States  Canada  and Mexico  to encourage trade amongst the countries  The treaty also restricts patents  copyrights  and trademarks  and outlines the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries     The agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats  who charged that NAFTA resulted in a loss of American jobs    NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights  according to the Bush administration  the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico s government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws  Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks  Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote  thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change    While initial signing was possible during his term  negotiations made slow  but steady  progress  President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration  despite its conservative and Republican rootswith the addition of two side agreementsto achieve its passage in 1993     The treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further  The American economy has grown 54  since the adoption of NAFTA in 1993  with 25million new jobs created  this was seen by some as evidence of NAFTA being beneficial to the United States    With talk in early 2008 regarding a possible American withdrawal from the treaty  Carlos M  Gutierrez   current United States Secretary of Commerce   writes   Quitting NAFTA would send economic shock waves throughout the world  and the damage would start here at home     But John J  Sweeney  President of the AFL CIO  wrote in The Boston Globe that  the U S  trade deficit with Canada and Mexico ballooned to 12 times its pre NAFTA size  reaching  111billion in 2004      On January 8  1992  Bush fainted after vomiting at a banquet hosted by the then Prime Minister of Japan   Kiichi Miyazawa   Bush was suffering from gastroenteritis    As other presidents have done  Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office  On December 24  1992  he granted executive clemency to six former government employees implicated in the Iran Contra scandal of the late 1980s  most prominently former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger     Bush described Weinberger  who was scheduled to stand trial on January 5  1993  for criminal charges related to Iran Contra  as a  true American patriot      In addition to Weinberger  Bush pardoned Duane R  Clarridge  Clair E  George  Robert C  McFarlane   Elliott Abrams   and Alan G  Fiers Jr   all of whom had been indicted and or convicted of criminal charges by an Independent Counsel headed by Lawrence Walsh      In 1990 Time magazine named him the Man of the Year   In 1991 the U S  Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Bush its Lone Sailor award for his naval service and his subsequent government service  In 1993  he was made an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath by Queen Elizabeth II     Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992  with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings  reelection initially looked likely  As a result  many leading Democrats declined to seek their party s presidential nomination  But an economic recession  and doubts of whether Bush ended the Gulf War properly  reduced his popularity   Conservative political columnist Pat Buchanan challenged Bush for the Republican nomination  and shocked political pundits by finishing second  with 37  of the vote  in the New Hampshire primary  Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues  in an attempt to undermine Buchanan s base    Once he had secured the nomination  Bush faced his challenger  Democrat and Governor of Arkansas William Jefferson  Bill  Clinton   Clinton attacked Bush as not doing enough to assist the working middle class and being  out of touch  with the common man  a notion reinforced by reporter Andrew Rosenthal  s false report that Bush was  astonished  to see a demonstration of a supermarket scanner      In early 1992  the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire H  Ross Perot launched a third party bid  claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient  His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties  perceived fiscal irresponsibility    Perot later bowed out of the race for a short time  then reentered     Clinton had originally been in the lead  until Perot reentered  tightening the race significantly    Nearing election day  polls suggested that the race was a dead heat    but Clinton pulled out on top  defeating Bush in a 43  to 38  popular vote margin  Perot won 19  of the popular vote  one of the highest totals for a third party candidate in U S  history  drawing equally from both major candidates  according to exit polls      Bush received 168 electoral votes to Clinton s 370     Several factors were key in Bush s defeat  The ailing economy which arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush s loss  as 7 in 10 voters said on election day that the economy was either  not so good  or  poor       On the eve of the 1992 election against these factors  Bush s approval rating stood at just 37    after suffering low ratings throughout the year     Conservative Republicans point to Bush s 1990 agreement to raise taxes in contradiction of his famous   Read my lips  no new taxes   pledge  In doing so  Bush alienated many members of his conservative base  losing their support for his re election  According to one survey  of the voters who cited Bush s broken  No New Taxes  pledge as  very important   two thirds voted for Bill Clinton    Bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit  which has largely been attributed to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s  The tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval ratings to the extent that it prevented it from reaching 89  during the Gulf War   four months after the tax vote    By February 1991 his approval rating rose to its highest level89      George Bush was widely seen as a  pragmatic caretaker  president who lacked a unified and compelling long term theme in his efforts        Indeed  Bush s sound bite where he refers to the issue of overarching purpose as  the vision thing  has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties               He does not say why he wants to be there   wrote columnist George Will   so the public does not know why it should care if he gets his way      His Ivy League and prep school education led to warnings by advisors that his image was too   preppy   in 1980  which resulted in deliberate efforts in his 1988 campaign to shed the image  including meeting voters at factories and shopping malls  abandoning set speeches     His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war s result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph    rousing bipartisan approval    though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings  and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy    A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader   the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was  out of touch   Amid the early 1990s recession   his image shifted from  conquering hero  to  politician befuddled by economic matters      Although Bush became the first elected Republican president since Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid  facing a 34  approval rating leading up to the 1992 election   the mood did not last  Despite his defeat  Bush climbed back from election day approval levels to leave office in 1993 with a 56  job approval rating    By December 2008  60  of Americans gave Bush s presidency a positive rating     Upon leaving office  Bush retired with his wife  Barbara  and temporarily moved into a friend s house near the Tanglewood community of Houston as they prepared to build a permanent retirement house nearby    Ultimately they built their retirement house in the community of West Oaks   near Tanglewood    They had a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building on Memorial Drive     Mimi Swartz of National Geographic wrote that  The Bushes are too studiously sedate to live in River Oaks      They spend the summer at Walker s Point in Kennebunkport  Maine   On January 10  1999  the Bushes became the longest married Presidential couple in history  outlasting John and Abigail Adams   who were married for 54 years and 3 days  At 70 years as of January 2015    they still hold the record  by a year and a half  over Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter   Bush holds his own fishing tournament in Islamorada   an island in the Florida Keys     citation needed    In 1993  Bush was awarded an honorary knighthood   GCB   by Queen Elizabeth II   He was the third American president to receive the honor  the others being Dwight D  Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan     In 1993  Bush visited Kuwait to commemorate the coalition s victory over Iraq in the Gulf War  where he was targeted in an assassination plot  Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 people allegedly involved in using a car bomb to kill Bush  Through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bomb s circuitry and wiring  the FBI established that the plot had been directed by the Iraqi Intelligence Service   A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants  Two months later  in retaliation  Clinton ordered the firing of 23 cruise missiles at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in Baghdad   The day before the strike  U S  Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright went before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot  After the missiles were fired  Vice President Al Gore said the attack  was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot  to assassinate Bush  was hatched and implemented      From 1993 to 1999 he served as the chairman to the board of trustees for Eisenhower Fellowships   and from 2007 to 2009 was chairman of the National Constitution Center    In 1997  the same year as the opening of his Presidential Library  the Houston international airport was renamed George Bush Intercontinental Airport    President Bush is Honorary Chairman of Points of Light   an international nonprofit dedicated to engaging more people and resources in solving serious social problems through voluntary service     His eldest son  George W  Bush   was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States on January 20  2001  and re elected in 2004  Through previous administrations  the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as  George Bush  or  President Bush   but following his son s election the need to distinguish between them has made retronymic forms such as  George H  W  Bush  and  George Bush senior and colloquialisms such as  Bush 41  and  Bush the Elder  much more common   The George Bush Presidential Library is the presidential library named for Bush  This tenth presidential library was built between 1995 and 1997 and contains the presidential and vice presidential papers of Bush and the vice presidential papers of Dan Quayle     It was dedicated on November 6  1997  and opened to the public shortly thereafter  the architectural firm of Hellmuth  Obata and Kassabaum designed the complex   The George Bush Presidential Library and

Award for fundraising  with Bill Clinton  for the victims of the 2004 tsunami and Hurricane Katrina      Upon the death of Gerald Ford   Bush became the oldest living president  111 days older than Jimmy Carter    On February 18  2008  Bush formally endorsed Senator John McCain for the presidency of the United States    The endorsement offered a boost to McCain s campaign  as the Arizona Senator had been facing criticism among many conservatives     On January 10  2009  both George H  W  and George W  Bush were present at the commissioning of the USS George H W  Bush  CVN 77    the tenth and

1862  was an American politician who served as the eighth President of the United States  18371841   A member of the Democratic Party   he served in a number of senior roles  including eighth Vice President  18331837  and Secretary of State  18291831   both under Andrew Jackson   Van Buren s inability as president to deal with the economic chaos of the Panic of 1837 and with the surging Whig Party led to his defeat in the 1840 election   Of Dutch descent  Van Buren learned early how to coordinate multiple ethnic and political groups  A meticulous dresser  he could mingle in upper class society as well as in saloon environments such as the tavern his father ran    A delegate to a political convention at age 18  he quickly moved from local to state politics  gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer  Elected to the Senate by the state legislature in 1821  Van Buren supported William H  Crawford for president in 1824  but by 1828 had come to support General Andrew Jackson  Van Buren was a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the 1828 election  Jackson was elected  and made Van Buren Secretary of State    During Jackson s eight years as president  Van Buren was a key advisor  and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party  particularly in New York  In 1831  Jackson gave him a recess appointment as American minister to Britain   but Van Buren s nomination was rejected by the Senate  cutting short his service in London  He was successful in the jockeying to become Jackson s picked successor  and was elected vice president in 1832  Van Buren faced several Whig opponents in his presidential bid in 1836  and was elected   As president  Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837  hostile newspapers called him  Martin Van Ruin   He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an independent treasury rather than in state banksbut Congress would not approve of this until 1840  In foreign affairs  he wanted the United States not to annex Texas  the 10th president John Tyler would annex the state eight years after Van Buren s initial rejection   Additionally  relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada proved to be strained from the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair    In 1840  Van Buren was voted out of office  losing to Whig candidate William Henry Harrison   Van Buren was the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in 1844   but lost to James K  Polk   who went on to win the election   In the 1848 election Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the Free Soil Party   He also supported fellow Democrats Franklin Pierce  1852   James Buchanan  1856   and Stephen A  Douglas  1860  for the presidency  but his increasingly abolitionist views and support for the Union led him to support Abraham Lincoln  s policies after the start of the American Civil War    Van Buren s health began to fail in 1861  and he died in July 1862 at the age of seventy nine  Although he served in many high offices  his most lasting achievement was as a political organizer who built the modern Democratic Party and guided it to dominance in the new Second Party System        Born on December 5  1782  Martin Van Buren was the first president to be born after the United States declared independence   He was baptized on December 15 of that year as  Maarten van Buren   the original Dutch spelling of his name  He was born in the village of Kinderhook  New York   on December 5  1782  about 20 miles  32km  south of Albany on the Hudson River   In the era before the steamboat  Kinderhook was an isolated village  and most of the townsfolk  including the Van Burens  were of Dutch descent and spoke Dutch at home  Martin Van Buren was the only president who spoke English as a second language   Van Buren descended from Cornelis Maessen of the town of Buren in the Netherlands  who had come to America in 1631 and purchased a plot of land on Manhattan Island  his son  Martin Cornelisen  took the surname Van Buren       The future president s father  Abraham Van Buren  17371817   was a farmer who owned a Kinderhook inn as well as six slaves    Abraham Van Buren supported the American Revolution as a captain in the Albany County Militia s 7th Regiment       and later joined the Jeffersonian Republicans    He was active in local politics and government  and served as Kinderhook s town clerk from 1787 to 1797    Martin Van Buren s mother was Maria Hoes Van Alen Van Buren  17471818   She had been married to Johannes Van Alen  After Johannes  death  she married Abraham Van Buren in 1776  By his mother s first marriage  Van Buren had one half sister and two half brothers  including James I  Van Alen   who practiced law with Van Buren for a time and served as a member of Congress  18071809   Van Buren had four full siblings       Van Buren received a basic education at the village schoolhouse and briefly studied Latin at the Kinderhook Academy and at Washington Seminary in Claverack      His formal education ended before he reached 14  when he began reading law in 1796 at the office of Peter Silvester and his son Francis  prominent Federalist attorneys in Kinderhook     Van Buren was small in stature  as an adult he was 5 feet 6 inches tall  and often referred to as  Little Van     When he first began his legal studies  he often presented an unkempt appearance in rough  homespun clothing    It was the Silvesters who suggested that Van Buren could improve his professional prospects by dressing fashionably and taking care in how he appeared in public  he heeded the advice and patterned his clothing  appearance  bearing and conduct after theirs      After six years under the Silvesters  the elder Silvester and Democratic Republican political figure John Peter Van Ness suggested that Van Buren s political leanings made it a good idea for him to complete his education with a Democratic Republican attorney  Accepting this advice  he spent a final year of apprenticeship in the New York City office of John Van Ness s brother William P  Van Ness   a political lieutenant of Aaron Burr     Van Buren was admitted to the bar in 1803       Van Buren married Hannah Hoes   his childhood sweetheart and first cousin once removed  on February 21  1807  in Catskill  New York     Like Van Buren  she was raised in a Dutch home  she spoke primarily Dutch  and spoke English with a distinct accent    The couple had five sons and one daughter  Abraham  18071873  a graduate of West Point and career military officer  John  18101866   graduate of Yale and Attorney General of New York  Martin  Jr   18121855   secretary to his father and editor of his father s papers until a premature death from tuberculosis  Winfield Scott  born and died in 1814   and Smith Thompson  18171876   an editor and special assistant to his father while president    Their daughter was stillborn    After 12 years of marriage  Hannah Van Buren contracted tuberculosis and died on February 5  1819  at the age of 35    Martin Van Buren never remarried     Van Buren had been active in politics from at least the age of 17 when he attended a party convention in Troy  New York   where he worked successfully to secure for John Peter Van Ness the Democratic Republican Party nomination in a special election for the 6th Congressional District seat    He formed a law partnership with his half brother James I  Van Alen   and once established in his practice  he became financially secure enough to increase his focus on politics    He was a supporter of Aaron Burr   and allied himself with the George Clinton faction of the Democratic Republican Party   Van Buren supported Daniel D  Tompkins for Governor over incumbent Morgan Lewis in 1807  Tompkins won  and his allies were a majority in the state legislature  As a result  Van Buren was appointed Surrogate of Columbia County  New York   replacing Van Alen  who had supported Lewis  Van Buren served as Surrogate from 1808 until 1813  when the Federalist Party obtained a majority in the state legislature and replaced him       Van Buren was a member of the New York State Senate from 1812 to 1820  and joined the opposition party in 1813   The opposition party were Democratic Republicans who fought DeWitt Clinton for control of the Democratic Republican Party in New York   Van Buren served as New York Attorney General from 1815 to 1819  He replaced William Floyd as a presidential elector in 1820   and voted for James Monroe and Daniel D  Tompkins      Though he never served in the military  during the War of 1812 Van Buren worked in the State Senate to pass war measures  including bills to expand the New York Militia and increase soldier pay  In addition  he was a special judge advocate appointed to serve as one of the prosecutors of William Hull during Hull s court martial following the surrender of Detroit        At first he opposed DeWitt Clinton s plan for the Erie Canal   but he supported it when the Bucktails  the name given to the anti DeWitt Clinton Democratic Republicans  were able to gain a majority on the Erie Canal Commission   and he supported a bill that raised money for the canal through the sale of state bonds     In 1817  Van Buren s connection with so called  machine politics  started when he created the first political organization encompassing all of New York  the Bucktails    The Bucktails became a successful movement that emphasized party loyalty and used it to capture and control many patronage posts throughout New York  Van Buren gained the nickname of  Little Magician  for the skill with which he exploited what came to be called the   spoils system    Van Buren served as a member of the 1820 state constitutional convention   where he favored expanded voting rights  but opposed universal suffrage and tried to maintain property requirements for voting     He was the leading figure in the Albany Regency   a group of Bucktail leaders who for more than a generation dominated the politics of New York and influenced national politics  The Regency  together with other political organizations such as Tammany Hall   played a major role in expanding the spoils system and making it a recognized and accepted procedure  He was the prime architect of the first nationwide political party  the Jacksonian Democrats or Democratic Party   which evolved from the Democratic Republicans and relied on party loyalty and patronage to prevent contentious sectional issues  including tariffs and slavery  from becoming national crises  In Van Buren s words   Without strong national political organizations  there would be nothing to moderate the prejudices between free and slaveholding states     As had James Madison and other Democratic Party organizers who favored states  rights and local control  Van Buren was struggling to find an institutional solution to the Constitution s seeming inability to prevent concentration of power in an administrative republic      Early in his life Van Buren owned a slave  a man named Tom who served as his personal valet  Tom ran away in 1814 and eventually settled in Canada   with Van Buren making no effort to locate him  In 1824 Tom was found to be living in Worcester  Massachusetts   Since he still legally owned Tom  under New York s gradual emancipation law  slavery was scheduled to be completely abolished in the state in 1827   Van Buren agreed to sell Tom to the finder  a resident of Rensselaer County   for  50 provided that he could be captured without violence  The finder could not make such a guarantee  and his willingness to pay was lessened by the knowledge that Tom would be emancipated in less than three years even if he was re enslaved  so Tom remained free  as Van Buren probably intended       In February 1821   Martin Van Buren was elected a U S  Senator from New York   defeating the incumbent Nathan Sanford who ran as the Clintonian candidate    Van Buren at first favored internal improvements   such as road repairs and canal construction  proposing a constitutional amendment in 1824 to authorize such undertakings  but changed his position the following year  He voted for the tariffs of 1824 and 1828  and then gradually abandoned this protectionist position  later coming out for tariffs  for revenue only      In the presidential election of 1824   Van Buren supported William H  Crawford and received the electoral vote of Georgia for Vice President   None of the presidential candidatesCrawford  John Quincy Adams   Andrew Jackson   or Henry Clay had received a majority of the electoral college votes  so the choice fell to the United States House of Representatives   The House had to choose from among the top three candidates  so Clay was eliminated  Van Buren had originally hoped to block John Quincy Adams by denying him the state of New York  which was divided between supporters of Crawford and Adams  However  Representative Stephen Van Rensselaer swung New York to Adams  Adams won  and appointed Clay as Secretary of State  Because Clay had supported Adams in the House election  Jackson and Crawford supporters alleged corruption    After the House contest  Van Buren shrewdly kept out of the controversy which followed   and began looking forward to 1828  He switched his support early from Crawford  whose ill health after a stroke had made him a less than viable candidate  to Andrew Jackson   who had won the popular vote in 1824  Jackson was angered to see the presidency go to Adams after he received fewer votes than Jackson  and Jackson eagerly looked forward to a rematch     Always notably courteous in his treatment of opponents  Van Buren showed no bitterness toward either Adams or Henry Clay   and he voted for Clay s confirmation as Secretary of State   notwithstanding Jackson s   corrupt bargain   charge      At the same time  he opposed the Adams Clay plans for internal infrastructure improvements  roads  canals  bridges etc   and declined to support U S  participation in the Congress of Panama     As chair of the Judiciary Committee  he brought forward a number of measures for the improvement of judicial procedure  including one  not adopted   which would have required a super majority vote by the United States Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional    in May 1826  Van Buren joined with Senator Thomas Hart Benton in reporting on patronage in the executive branch  going against his own use of the spoils system to propose unsuccessfully that Presidents not be able to remove officeholders at will  and that Presidents report to Congress on the reasons why dismissed holders of federal positions had been removed    The 1828   Tariff of Abominations   was recognized as his work  Since Democrats  especially Southerners  were generally opposed to tariffs that increased the price of manufactured goods from the North but did not benefit the raw materials produced in the South  Van Buren could normally have been expected to oppose tariffs  Political observers of the time viewed Van Buren s efforts to pass the 1828 tariff as part of the campaign to elect Jackson as President  Anticipating that most Southerners would vote for Andrew Jackson no matter who else was running  Van Buren intended the tariff proposed by Jackson s Northern Democratic supporters in Congress to attract to Jackson s candidacy Northern voters  who generally favored high tariffs to protect the manufactured goods they produced  Van Buren voted in favor  later adopting the cover story that he had done so only in response to instructions from the New York State Legislature   Most Democrats  especially Southerners  continued to oppose tariffs after 1828  Van Buren s political opponents in the Democratic Party used his 1828 vote against him for years afterwards to prevent him from obtaining Southern support for his candidacies         Van Buren was not an orator  but his more important speeches show careful preparation and his opinions carried weight  the oft repeated charge that he refrained from declaring himself on crucial questions is hardly borne out by an examination of his senatorial career  In February 1827   he was re elected to the Senate by a large majority  He became one of the recognized managers of the Jackson campaign  and his tour of Virginia   the Carolinas   and Georgia in the spring of 1827 won support for Jackson from Crawford  Martin Van Buren sought to reorganize and unify  the old Republican party  behind Jackson    At the state level  Jackson s committee chairs would split up the responsibilities around the state and organize volunteers at the local level   Hurra Boys  would plant hickory trees  in honor of Jackson s nickname   Old Hickory   or hand out hickory sticks at rallies  In 1828 Van Buren ran for Governor of New York in an effort to use his personal popularity to bolster Jackson s chances of carrying New York in the presidential election  Jackson defeated Adams handily  leading the pro Adams New York American to editorialize  Organization is the secret of victory  By the want of it we have been overthrown     Van Buren won his election  and resigned from the Senate to start the gubernatorial term  which began on January 1  1829     Martin Van Buren s tenure as New York governor is the second shortest on record  While his term was short  he did manage to pass the Bank Safety Fund Law  an early form of deposit insurance  through the Legislature     On March 5  1829  President Jackson appointed Van Buren Secretary of State   an office which probably had been assured to him before the 1828 elections  and Van Buren resigned the governorship on March 12    He was succeeded in the governorship by his Lieutenant Governor  Enos T  Throop   a member of the Regency  As Secretary of State  Van Buren took care to keep on good terms with the Kitchen Cabinet   the group of politicians who acted as Jackson s advisers  He sometimes opposed Jackson in the matter of removing political appointees from office to replace them with Jackson loyalists  but also saw to the replacement of Postmasters in New York with Van Buren loyalists     He won the lasting regard of Jackson by his courtesies to Peggy Eaton   wife of Secretary of War John H  Eaton   with whom the wives of the cabinet officers led by Vice President Calhoun s wife  Floride Calhoun had refused to associate in the Petticoat Affair        No serious diplomatic questions arose during Van Buren s tenure  but he achieved several notable successes  including the settlement of long standing claims against France  winning reparations for property that had been seized during the Napoleonic Wars   He reached an agreement with the British to open trade with the British West Indies colonies  In addition  Van Buren completed a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that gained American merchants access to the Black Sea   Items on which he did not achieve success included settling the Maine   New Brunswick boundary dispute with Great Britain  gaining settlement of the U S  claim to the Oregon Country   concluding a commercial treaty with Russia   and persuading Mexico to sell Texas        Van Buren also advised Jackson informally on matters of domestic policy  In the controversy over the Bank of the United States   he sided with Jackson  He also sided with Jackson on the Indian Removal Act       After the breach between Jackson and Calhoun  which culminated with the Nullification Crisis   Van Buren s position as one of Jackson s primary political supporters and policy advisors clearly marked him as the most prominent candidate for the vice presidency in 1832  and Jackson s most likely successor in 1836     In December 1829  Jackson had already made known his wish that Van Buren receive the 1832 vice presidential nomination    In April 1831  Van Buren resigned as Secretary of State during the Petticoat affair   giving Jackson the opportunity to end the dispute by requesting other resignations so he could reorganize his cabinet    Van Buren did not leave office until June  and continued to play a part in the Kitchen Cabinet     In August 1831 Jackson gave Van Buren a recess appointment as Minister to the Court of St  James  Britain  and he arrived in London in September    He was cordially received  but in February  he learned that his nomination had been rejected by the Senate on January 25  1832    The rejection was attributed by the Senate to Van Buren s instructions while Secretary of State to Louis McLane   the American minister to Britain  Van Buren s instructions  which concerned the opening of the West Indies trade  supposedly repudiated the foreign policy of Jackson s predecessors  which the Senate claimed was a breach of decorum    In fact  the rejection of Van Buren was the work of Calhoun   Calhoun opposed Van Buren  believing that Van Buren had attempted to keep him from becoming vice president  Calhoun also opposed Van Buren for his role in the Petticoat Affair and his work on the 1828 tariff  When the vote on Van Buren s nomination was taken  enough pro Calhoun Democrats refrained from voting to produce a tie  thus giving Calhoun  in his role as presiding officer  the ability to cast a vote  He voted no  and so achieved  vengeance  on Van Buren     Calhoun was elated  convinced that he had ended Van Buren s career   It will kill him dead  sir  kill him dead  He will never kick  sir  never kick   Calhoun exclaimed to a friend within earshot of Thomas Hart Benton     In fact  Calhoun s move backfired by making Van Buren seem the victim of petty politics  thus raising him in both Jackson s regard and the esteem of others in the Democratic Party  Far from ending Van Buren s career  Calhoun s action gave greater impetus to Van Buren s candidacy for vice president     After a brief tour of Europe  Van Buren reached New York on July 5  1832  The May 1832 Democratic National Convention   the party s first  had nominated him for vice president on the Jackson ticket    Van Buren s nomination was not as strongly supported as Jackson s  particularly among southerners who recalled his work on the tariff in 1828  but he somewhat placated southerners by denying the right of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia without the consent of the slave states     The Jackson Van Buren ticket won the 1832 election  and Van Buren took office as Vice President in March 1833    During his time in office Van Buren continued to be one of Jackson s primary advisors and confidants  and accompanied Jackson on his tour of the northeastern United States in 1833    Jackson s confidence in Van Buren was further demonstrated after Jackson named Benjamin F  Butler   Van Buren s political ally and former law partner  to serve as Attorney General     and John Forsyth   another Van Buren ally  to serve as Secretary of State       Van Buren s support of Jackson in the Nullification Crisis and the decision not to recharter the Second Bank of the United States made him a target of Jackson s most vocal opponents  Van Buren was threatened with violence  including explicit threats from Senator George Poindexter of Mississippi  which caused Van Buren to carry pistols for self defense  However he also demonstrated both the willingness and the ability to work with his opponents  cooperating with Clay and Calhoun  now a Senator  to pass the compromise Tariff of 1833   which helped end the Nullification Crisis     During one contentious debate on the bank issue  Van Buren presided over the Senate as Clay spoke passionately about the harm he believed Jackson s bank policy would cause  Directing his remarks to Van Buren  Clay asked rhetorically whether Van Buren would approach Jackson and persuade him to change his mind  After Clay concluded  observers wondered how Van Buren would respond  Rather than answering directly  Van Buren descended from the rostrum and asked Clay if he could borrow a pinch of Clay s snuff   Caught off guard  Clay reflexively handed over his snuff box   Van Buren took a pinch  bowed to Clay  and left the chamber  both reducing the effect of Clay s remarks and preventing tension from escalating  as would have happened if Van Buren had attempted to reply to Clay     In the election of 1832   the Jackson Van Buren ticket won by a landslide    Jackson  not running in 1836  was determined to make Van Buren his successor in order to continue the Jackson administration s policies     Van Buren was unanimously nominated by the 1835 Democratic National Convention at Baltimore  Maryland   On the issue of slavery  Van Buren moved to obtain the support of southerners by assuring them that he opposed abolitionism and supported the maintaining of slavery in states where it had already existed    Regarding the national bank  Van Buren made clear that he opposed rechartering a national bank     To demonstrate consistency regarding his opinions on slavery  Van Buren cast the tie breaking Senate vote in favor of engrossing a bill to subject abolitionist mail to state laws  thus ensuring that its circulation would be prohibited in the South     Martin Van Buren s competitors in the 1836 election were the Whigs   they ran several regional candidates in hopes of sending the election to the House of Representatives  where each state delegation would have one vote and the Whigs would stand a better chance of winning    William Henry Harrison hoped to receive the support of the Western voters  Daniel Webster had strength in New England  and Hugh Lawson White and Willie Person Mangum had support in the South  Van Buren won the election easily  with 170 electoral votes to 73 for Harrison  26 for White  14 for Webster and 11 for Mangum     Twentieth century etymologist Allen Walker Read published research asserting the wide usage of the phrase  O K     okay        O ld K inderhook started during the presidential campaign and subsequent presidency of Martin Van Buren     Martin Van Buren announced his intention  to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor   and retained all but one of Jackson s cabinet  Van Buren had few economic tools to deal with the Panic of 1837   The Panic was followed by a five year depression in which banks failed and unemployment reached record highs    Some modern economists have argued that the Panic was caused by the Jackson administration s bank policies  with the power to create money being distributed into decentralized banks  most of which would then continue to cause a massive inflationary bubble      Van Buren advocated lower tariffs and free trade  and by doing so maintained support of the South for the Democratic Party  He succeeded in setting up a system of bonds for the national debt  His party was so split that his 1837 proposal for an  Independent Treasury  system did not pass until 1840  It gave the Treasury control of all federal funds and had a legal tender clause that required  by 1843  all payments to be made in specie   but further inflamed public opinion on both sides     In a bold step  Van Buren reversed Andrew Jackson s policies and sought peace at home  as well as abroad  Instead of settling a financial dispute between American citizens and the Mexican government by force  Van Buren wanted to seek a diplomatic solution  In August 1837  Van Buren denied Texas   formal request to join the United States  again prioritizing sectional harmony over territorial expansion    This action particularly angered pro slavery leaders  who thought he did not want to admit Texas as a slave state per the Missouri Compromise    In the case of the ship Amistad   Van Buren sided with the Spanish government to return the kidnapped slaves    Regarding Indian removal  Van Buren oversaw the movement of Cherokee   Choctaw   Creek   Chickasaw and Seminole tribes from Georgia   Tennessee   Alabama   and South Carolina to the Oklahoma territory   executing the orders passed under Jackson     To help secure Florida   Van Buren also continued the Second Seminole War   which had begun during Jackson s presidency  Fighting was not resolved until 1842  after Van Buren had left office     In 1839  Joseph Smith  Jr    the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement   visited Van Buren to plead for the U S  to help roughly 20 000 Mormon settlers of Independence  Missouri  who were forced from the state during the 1838 Mormon War   there  The Governor of Missouri  Lilburn Boggs   had issued an executive order on October 27  1838  known as the  Extermination Order   It authorized troops to use force against Mormons to  exterminate or drive  them  from the state       In 1839  after moving to Illinois  Smith and his party appealed to members of Congress and to President Van Buren to intercede for the Mormons  According to Smith s grandnephew  Van Buren said to Smith   Your cause is just  but I can do nothing for you  if I take up for you I shall lose the vote of Missouri        While in the state Senate Van Buren voted for a resolution instructing New York s members of Congress to vote against the admission of Missouri as a slave state  In 1848 he would be the nominated for president by the Free Soil Party  an anti slavery political party     Despite these antislavery views  during his term of office there was no ambiguity about his position on the abolition of slavery    Van Buren actually considered slavery immoral  but sanctioned by the Constitution    He was against its abolition both in D C  and in the United States altogether  and said so in his Inaugural Address in 1837   I believed it a solemn duty fully to make known my sentiments in regard to it  slavery   and now  when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away  I trust that they will be candidly weighed and understood      I must go into the Presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia against the wishes of the slaveholding States  and also with a determination equally decided to resist the slightest interference with it in the States where it exists     Slavery would be abolished in the District of Columbia on April 18  1862     Van Buren appointed two Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States      Van Buren appointed eight other federal judges  all to United States district courts      Some sources incorrectly state that Van Buren appointed John Catron to the Supreme Court    Catron was appointed by Jackson on Jackson s last day in office  and confirmed a few days later  after Van Buren s term had begun     Van Buren took the blame for hard times  as Whigs ridiculed him as Martin Van Ruin   Van Buren s rather elegant personal style was also an easy target for Whig attacks  such as the Gold Spoon Oration   State elections of 1837 and 1838 were disastrous for the Democrats  and the partial economic recovery in 1838 was offset by a second commercial crisis in that year  Nevertheless  Van Buren controlled his party and was unanimously renominated by the Democrats in 1840  The revolt against Democratic rule led to the election of William Henry Harrison   the Whig candidate  Van Buren once mentioned his relief upon leaving office   As to the presidency  the two happiest days of my life were those of my entrance upon the office and my surrender of it      On the expiration of his term  Van Buren returned to his estate  Lindenwald in Kinderhook  where he planned his return to the White House  He seemed likely to be nominated by the Democrats in 1844  but in April of that year a Van Buren letter to William H  Hammett was made public    In it  Van Buren opposed the immediate annexation of Texas   but said that he would support annexation once the state of war between Texas and Mexico was resolved    Van Buren s opposition to immediate annexation cost him the support of pro slavery Democrats  he began the Democratic National Convention with a majority of the delegates  but with no southern support he could not reach the two thirds threshold required for nomination    His name was withdrawn after eight ballots  and a dark horse   James K  Polk   received the nomination and went on to win the presidency      Van Buren was increasingly opposed to slavery  and his original attempts to accommodate pro slavery southerners gave way over time to acceptance of anti slavery positions including opposing slavery s expansion into newly organized western states    In 1848  he was nominated for President by two minor parties  first by the   Barnburner   faction of the Democratic Party in New York  then by the Free Soil Party   with whom the  Barnburners  coalesced  The Barnburners and Free Soilers opposed Democratic nominee Lewis Cass   who opposed the Wilmot Proviso and was otherwise seen as friendly to slavery    In addition  Van Buren  who had been denied the 1844 nomination by Cass supporters despite having begun the convention with a majority of delegates  may have run in order to exact a measure of revenge by denying Cass the presidency    Van Buren won no electoral votes  but finished second to Whig nominee Zachary Taylor in New York  taking enough votes from Cass to give the stateand perhaps the electionto Taylor     Unlike many anti slavery Democrats of the 1840s and 1850s  who later joined the Republican Party   Van Buren and most of his followers remained in the Democratic fold  including his son John Van Buren and Samuel J  Tilden   who later served as Governor of New York and was the Democratic nominee for President in 1876       Van Buren supported Franklin Pierce for President in 1852  and James Buchanan in 1856  though he later opposed the Buchanan administration s efforts to accommodate the southern states when they threatened secession       In the election of 1860   he supported Stephen A  Douglas   the candidate of northern Democrats  and helped create a fusion ticket in New York of Democratic electors pledged to both Douglas and John C  Breckinridge   but Abraham Lincoln carried New York and every northern state except New Jersey     Once the American Civil War began  Van Buren made public his support for the Union   and supported Abraham Lincoln  s efforts to prevent the southern states from seceding    In April  1861 former President Pierce wrote to the other living former Presidents and asked them to consider meeting in order to use their stature and influence to propose a negotiated end to the war  Pierce asked Van Buren to use his role as the senior living ex President to issue a formal call  Van Buren s reply suggested that Buchanan should be the one to call the meeting  since he was the former President who had served most recently  and nothing more resulted from Pierce s proposal     Van Buren s health began to fail later in 1861  and he was bedridden with pneumonia during the fall and winter of 1861 1862    He did not recover  and died of bronchial asthma and heart failure at his Lindenwald estate in Kinderhook at 2 00a m  on July 24  1862 at the age of 79    He is buried in the Kinderhook Reformed Dutch Church Cemetery  as are his wife Hannah  his parents  and his son Martin Van Buren  Jr       Counties are named for Martin Van Buren in Michigan

his death  Although Harding died one of the most popular presidents in history  the subsequent exposure of scandals that took place under him  such as Teapot Dome   eroded his popular regard  as did revelations of an affair by Nan Britton   one of his mistresses  In historical rankings of the U S  presidents   Harding has been rated among the worst   Harding was born in Blooming Grove  Ohio   Except when political service took him elsewhere  he lived in rural Ohio all his life  When not yet 20 years old  he settled in Marion and bought The Marion Star   building it into a successful newspaper  In 1899  he was elected to the Ohio State Senate   and after four years there successfully ran for lieutenant governor   He was defeated for governor in 1910  but was elected to the Senate in 1914   When Harding ran for the Republican nomination for president in 1920  he was considered an also ran with little chance of success  The leading candidates  such as General Leonard Wood   could not gain a majority to secure the nomination  and the convention deadlocked  Harding s support gradually grew until he was nominated on the tenth ballot  He conducted a front porch campaign   remaining for the most part in Marion  and allowing the people to come to him  Running on a theme of return to normalcy   he won in a landslide over Democrat James M  Cox and Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs   becoming the first sitting senator to be elected president   Harding appointed a number of well regarded figures  including Andrew Mellon at the Treasury   Herbert Hoover at Commerce   and Charles Evans Hughes at the State Department   A major foreign policy achievement came with the Washington Naval Conference of 19211922  in which the world s major naval powers agreed on a naval limitations program that lasted a decade  Two members of his cabinet  Interior Secretary Albert Fall and Attorney General Harry Daugherty   were implicated in corruption  The resulting scandals did not fully emerge until after Harding s death  nor did word of his extramarital affairs  but both greatly damaged his reputation  Harding died of a cerebral hemorrhage caused by heart disease in San Francisco while on a western speaking tour  he was succeeded by his vice president  Calvin Coolidge      Harding was born November 2  1865  in Blooming Grove  Ohio     Nicknamed  Winnie  as a small child  Harding was the eldest of eight children born to George Tryon Harding  Sr   18431928  usually known as Tryon  and Phoebe Elizabeth  Dickerson  Harding  18431910     Phoebe was a state licensed midwife  Tryon farmed and taught school near Mount Gilead  Ohio   Through apprenticeship  study  and a year of medical school  Tryon became a doctor  and started a small practice     It was rumored in Blooming Grove that one of Harding s great grandmothers was African American     His great great grandfather Amos Harding claimed that a thief  who had been caught in the act by the family  started the rumor in an attempt at extortion or revenge    Nevertheless  even after Warren Harding s death in 1923  African Americans made claims of kinship    After Harding s death  genetic testing of Harding s descendants determined  with more than a 95  percent chance of accuracy  that he lacked sub Saharan African forbears within four previous generations      The Harding family  who were abolitionists     moved to Caledonia  Ohio   where Tyron acquired The Argus   a local weekly newspaper  At The Argus   Harding  from the age of 11  learned the basics of the newspaper business     In late 1879  at the age of 14  Harding enrolled at Ohio Central College in Iberia   where he proved an adept student  He and a friend put out a small newspaper during their final year at Ohio Central  the Iberia Spectator   intended to appeal to both college and town  During his final year  the Harding family moved to Marion  Ohio   about 6 miles  9 7km  from Caledonia  and when he graduated in 1882  he joined them there     In Harding s youth  the majority of the population still lived on farms and in small towns  He would spend much of his life in Marion  a small city in rural Ohio  and would become closely associated with it  When Harding rose to high office  he made clear his love of Marion and its way of life  telling of the many young Marionites who had left and enjoyed success elsewhere  while suggesting that the man  once the  pride of the school   who had remained behind and become a janitor   was  the happiest one of the lot      Upon graduating  Harding had stints as a teacher and as an insurance man  and made a brief attempt at studying law  He then raised  300 in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper  The Marion Star   weakest of the growing city s three papers  and its only daily  The 18 year old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention   where he hobnobbed with better known journalists and supported the presidential nominee  former Secretary of State James G  Blaine   Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff    During the election campaign  Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee  New York Governor Grover Cleveland   who won the election     Afterwards  with the financial aid of his father  the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper     Through the latter years of the 1880s  Warren Harding built the Star   The city of Marion tended to vote Republican  as did Ohio  but Marion County was Democratic  Accordingly  Harding adopted a tempered editorial stance  declaring the daily Star nonpartisan  and circulating a weekly edition that was moderate Republican  This policy attracted advertisers  and put the Republican weekly in town out of business  According to his biographer  Andrew Sinclair   The success of Harding with the Star was certainly in the model of Horatio Alger   He started with nothing  and though working  stalling  bluffing  withholding payments  borrowing back wages  boasting  and manipulating  he turned a dying rag into a powerful small town newspaper  Much of his success had to do with his good looks  affability  enthusiasm  and persistence  but he was also lucky  As Machiavelli once pointed out  cleverness will take a man far  but he cannot do without good fortune     The population of Marion grew from 4 000 in 1880 to twice that in 1890  increasing to 12 000 by 1900  This growth helped the Star   and Harding did his best to promote the city  purchasing stock in many local enterprises  Although a few of these turned out badly  he was in general successful as an investor  leaving an estate of  850 000 in 1923    According to Harding biographer and former White House Counsel John Dean   Harding s  civic influence was that of an activist who used his editorial page to effectively keep his noseand a prodding voicein all the town s public business     He became an ardent supporter of Governor Joseph B  Foraker   a Republican     Harding first came to know Florence Kling   five years older than himself  as the daughter of a local banker and developer  Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way  but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper  Amos involved Florence in all his affairs  taking her to work from the time she could walk  As hard headed as her father  Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college    a   After she eloped with Pete deWolfe  and returned to Marion without deWolfe  but with an infant called Marshall  Amos agreed to raise the boy  but would not support Florence  who made a living as a piano teacher  One of her students was Harding s sister Charity  By 1886  Florence Kling had obtained a divorce  and she and Warren Harding were courting  though who was pursuing whom is uncertain  depending on who later told the story of their romance       A truce between the Klings was snuffed out by the budding match  as Amos believed that the Hardings had African American blood  and was also offended by Harding s editorial stances  He started to spread rumors of Harding s supposed black heritage and encouraged local businessmen to boycott Harding s business interests    When Harding found out what Kling was doing  he warned Kling  that he would beat the tar out of the little man if he didn t cease     b     The Hardings were married at their new home on Mount Vernon Avenue in Marion  which they had designed together in the Queen Anne style     on July 8  1891    The marriage produced no children    Warren Harding affectionately called his wife  the Duchess   based on a character in a serial from The New York Sun   in which the Duchess kept a close eye on the Duke and their money  running anything that required efficiency     Florence Harding was deeply involved in her husband s career  both at the Star and once he entered politics    Exhibiting her father s determination and business sense  she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper s circulation department    She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone  some have suggested that she pushed him all the way to the White House     Soon after purchasing the Star   Harding turned his attention to politics  supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885  Foraker was part of the war generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans  such as Senator John Sherman   for control of state politics  Harding  always a party loyalist  supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics  Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats  as necessary to a two party system   but had only contempt for those who bolted the Republican Party to join third party movements    He was a delegate to the Republican state convention in 1888  at the age of 22  representing Marion County  and would be elected a delegate in most years until becoming president     Harding s success as an editor took a toll on his health  Five times between 1889  when he was 23  and 1901  he spent time at the Battle Creek Sanitorium for reasons Sinclair described as  fatigue  overstrain  and nervous illnesses     Dean ties these visits to early occurrences of the heart ailment that would kill Harding in 1923  During one such absence from Marion  in 1894  the Star  s business manager quit  Florence Harding took his place  She became her husband s top assistant at the Star on the business side  maintaining her role until the Hardings moved to Washington in 1915  Her assistance and competence allowed Warren Harding to travel to make speeches  his use of the free railroad pass increased greatly after his marriage     Florence Harding made sure no cents escaped hersometimes sending Warren to the bank with a gallon  3 8l  bucket full in each hand   and wrote of her husband   he does well when he listens to me and poorly when he does not      In 1892  Harding traveled to Washington  where he met Democratic Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan   and listened to the  Boy Orator of the Platte  speak on the floor of the House of Representatives  Harding traveled to Chicago s Columbian Exposition in 1893  Both visits were without Florence  Democrats generally won Marion County s offices  when Harding ran for auditor in 1895  he lost  but did better than expected  The following year  Harding was one of many orators who spoke across Ohio in support of the Republican presidential candidate  that state s former governor  William McKinley   According to Dean   while working for McKinley  Harding  began making a name for himself through Ohio      Harding wished to try again for elective office  Though a longtime admirer of Foraker  by then a U S  senator   he had been careful to maintain good relations with the party faction led by the state s other U S  senator  Mark Hanna   McKinley s political manager and chairman of the Republican National Committee  RNC   Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899  he gained the Republican nomination  and was easily elected to a two year term     Harding began his four years as a state senator a political unknown  he ended them one of the most popular figures in the Ohio Republican Party  He always appeared calm and displayed humility  characteristics that endeared him to fellow Republicans even as he passed them in his political rise  Legislative leaders consulted him on difficult problems    It was usual at that time for state senators in Ohio to serve only one term  but Harding gained renomination in 1901  After the assassination of McKinley in September  he was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt    much of the appetite for politics was temporarily lost in Ohio  In November  Harding gained a second term  more than doubling his margin of victory to 3 563 votes     Like most politicians of his time  Harding accepted that patronage and graft would be used to repay political favors  He had his sister Mary  who was legally blind  appointed a teacher at the Ohio School for the Blind   although there were better qualified candidates  and offered publicity in his newspaper in exchange for free railroad passes for himself and his family  According to Sinclair   it is doubtful that Harding ever thought there was anything dishonest in accepting the perquisites of position or office  Patronage and favors seemed the normal reward for party service in the days of Hanna      Soon after Harding s initial election as senator  he met Harry M  Daugherty   who would take on a major role in Harding s political career  A perennial candidate for office who served two terms in the state House of Representatives in the early 1890s  Daugherty had become a political fixer and lobbyist in the state capital of Columbus  After first meeting and talking with Harding  Daugherty commented   Gee  what a great looking President he d make      In early 1903  Harding announced he would run for Governor of Ohio   prompted by the withdrawal of the leading candidate  Congressman Charles Dick   Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Forakeras the Progressive Era commenced  the public was starting to take a dimmer view of the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox  Accordingly  they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T  Herrick   a friend of McKinley s  to run  Herrick was also better placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate  reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L  Johnson   With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination  Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor  and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation    Both Foraker and Hanna  who died of typhoid fever in February 1904  campaigned for what was dubbed the Four H ticket  Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins     Once he and Harding were inaugurated  Herrick made ill advised decisions that turned crucial Republican constituencies against him  alienating farmers by opposing the establishment of an agricultural college    On the other hand  according to Sinclair   Harding had little to do  and he did it very well     His responsibility to preside over the state Senate allowed him to increase his growing network of political contacts    Harding and others envisioned a successful gubernatorial run in 1905  but Herrick refused to stand aside  In early 1905  Harding announced he would accept nomination as governor if offered  but faced with the anger of leaders such as Cox  Foraker and Dick  Hanna s replacement in the Senate   announced he would seek no office in 1905  Herrick was defeated  but his new running mate  Andrew L  Harris   was elected  and succeeded as governor after five months in office on the death of Democrat John M  Pattison   One Republican official wrote to Harding   Aren t you sorry Dick wouldn t let you run for Lieutenant Governor      In addition to helping pick a president  Ohio voters in 1908 were to choose the legislators who would decide whether to re elect Foraker  The senator had quarreled with President Roosevelt over the Brownsville Affair   Though Foraker had little chance of winning  he sought the Republican presidential nomination against his fellow Cincinnatian  Secretary of War William Howard Taft   who was Roosevelt s chosen successor    On January 6  1908  Harding s Star endorsed Foraker and upbraided Roosevelt for trying to destoy the senator s career over a matter of conscience  On the 22nd  Harding in the Star reversed course and declared for Taft  deeming Foraker defeated    According to Sinclair  Harding s change to Taft  was not    because he saw the light but because he felt the heat     Jumping on the Taft bandwagon allowed Harding to survive his patron s disasterForaker failed to gain the presidential nomination  and was defeated for a third term as senator  Also helpful in saving Harding s career was the fact that he was popular with  and had done favors for  the more progressive forces that now controlled the Ohio Republican Party     Harding sought and gained the 1910 Republican gubernatorial nomination  At that time  the party was deeply divided between progressive and conservative wings  and could not defeat the united Democrats  he lost the election to incumbent Judson Harmon     Harry Daugherty managed Harding s campaign  but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him  Despite the growing rift between them  both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding  but their quarrels split the Republican Party and helped assure Harding s defeat     The party split grew  and in 1912  Taft and Roosevelt were rivals for the Republican nomination  The 1912 Republican National Convention was bitterly divided  At Taft s request  Harding gave a speech nominating the president  but the angry delegates were not receptive to Harding s oratory  Taft was renominated  but Roosevelt supporters bolted the party  Harding  as a loyal Republican  supported Taft  The Republican vote was split between Taft  the party s official candidate  and Roosevelt  running under the label of the Progressive Party   This allowed the Democratic candidate  New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson   to be elected     Congressman Theodore Burton had been elected in Foraker s place in 1909  and announced that he would seek a second term in the 1914 elections  By this time  the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution had been ratified  giving the people the right to elect senators  and Ohio had instituted primary elections for the office  Foraker and former congressman Ralph D  Cole also entered the Republican primary  When Burton withdrew  Foraker became the favorite  but his Old Guard Republicanism was deemed outdated  and Harding was urged to enter the race  Daugherty claimed credit for persuading Harding to run   I found him like a turtle sunning himself on a log  and I pushed him into the water     According to Harding biographer Randolph Downes   he put on a campaign of such sweetness and light as would have won the plaudits of the angels  It was calculated to offend nobody except Democrats     Although Harding did not attack Foraker  his supporters had no such scruples  Harding won the primary by 12 000 votes over Foraker     Read The Menace and get the dope  Go to the polls and beat the Pope   Harding s general election opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan  who had risen to statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas  In 1914  the start of World War I and the prospect of a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment  Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and The Defender contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio  Harding did not attack Hogan  an old friend  on this or most other issues  but he did not denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent       Harding s conciliatory campaigning style aided him    one Harding friend deemed the candidate s stump speech during the 1914 fall campaign as  a rambling  high sounding mixture of platitudes  patriotism  and pure nonsense     Dean notes   Harding used his oratory to good effect  it got him elected  making as few enemies as possible in the process     Harding won by over 100 000 votes in a landslide that also swept into office a Republican governor  Frank B  Willis      When Harding joined the U S  Senate  the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress  and were led by President Wilson  As a junior senator in the minority  Harding received unimportant committee assignments  but carried out those duties assiduously    He was a safe  conservative  Republican vote    As during his time in the Ohio Senate  Harding came to be widely liked     On two issues  women s suffrage  and the prohibition of alcohol  where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920  he prospered by taking nuanced positions  As senator elect  he indicated that he could not support votes for women until Ohio did  Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue  Harding was a firm supporter  Harding  who drank  initially voted against banning alcohol  He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment   which imposed Prohibition   after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification  which was expected to kill it  Once it was ratified anyway  Harding voted to override Wilson s veto of the Volstead Bill   which implemented the amendment  assuring the support of the Anti Saloon League      Harding  as a politician respected by both Republicans and Progressives  was asked to be temporary chairman of the 1916 Republican National Convention and to deliver the keynote address   He urged delegates to stand as a united party  The convention nominated Justice Charles Evans Hughes     Harding reached out to Roosevelt once the former president declined the 1916 Progressive nomination   a refusal that effectively scuttled that party  In the November 1916 presidential election   despite increasing Republican unity  Hughes was narrowly defeated by Wilson     Harding spoke and voted in favor of the resolution of war requested by Wilson in April 1917 that plunged the United States into World War I    In August  Harding argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers  stating that democracy had little place in time of war    Harding voted for most war legislation  including the Espionage Act of 1917   which restricted civil liberties  though he opposed the excess profits tax as anti business  In May 1918  Harding  less enthusiastic about Wilson  opposed a bill to expand the president s powers     In the 1918 midterm congressional elections  held just before the armistice  Republicans narrowly took control of the Senate    Harding was appointed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee     Wilson took no senators with him to the Paris Peace Conference   confident that he could force what became the Treaty of Versailles through the Senate by appealing to the people    When he returned with a single treaty establishing both peace and a League of Nations   the country was overwhelmingly on his side  Many senators disliked Article X of the League Covenant   that committed signatories to the defense of any member nation that was attacked  seeing it as forcing the United States to war without the assent of Congress  Harding was one of 39 senators who signed a round robin letter opposing the League  When Wilson invited the Foreign Relations Committee to the White House to informally discuss the treaty  Harding ably questioned Wilson about Article X  the president evaded his inquiries  The Senate debated Versailles in September 1919  and Harding made a major speech against it  By then  Wilson had suffered a stroke while on a speaking tour  With an invalid in the White House and less support in the country  the treaty was defeated     With most Progressives having rejoined the Republican Party  their former leader  Theodore Roosevelt  was deemed likely to make a third run for the White House in 1920  and was the overwhelming favorite for the Republican nomination  These plans ended when Roosevelt suddenly died on January 6  1919  A number of candidates quickly emerged  including General Leonard Wood   Illinois Governor Frank Lowden   California Senator Hiram Johnson   and a host of relatively minor possibilities such as Herbert Hoover  renowned for his World War I relief work   Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge   and General John J  Pershing      Harding  while he wanted to be president  was as much motivated in entering the race by his desire to keep control of Ohio Republican politics  enabling his re election to the Senate in 1920  Among those coveting Harding s seat were former governor Willis  he had been defeated by James M  Cox in 1916  and Colonel William Cooper Procter  the founder of Procter   Gamble    On December 17  1919  Harding made a low key announcement of his presidential candidacy    Leading Republicans disliked Wood and Johnson  both of the progressive faction of the party  and Lowden  who had an independent streak  was deemed little better  Harding was far more acceptable to the  Old Guard  leaders of the party     Daugherty  who became Harding s campaign manager  was sure none of the other candidates could garner a majority  His strategy was to make Harding an acceptable choice to delegates once the leaders faltered  Daugherty established a Harding for President campaign office in Washington  run by his confidant  Jess Smith    and worked to manage a network of Harding friends and supporters  including Frank Scobey of Texas  clerk of the Ohio State Senate during Harding s years there     Harding worked to shore up his support through incessant letter writing  Despite the candidate s work  according to Russell   without Daugherty s Mephistophelean efforts  Harding would never have stumbled forward to the nomination      America s present need is not heroics  but healing  not nostrums  but normalcy  not revolution  but restoration  not agitation  but adjustment  not surgery  but serenity  not the dramatic  but the dispassionate  not experiment  but equipoise  not submergence in internationality  but sustainment in triumphant nationality   There were only 16 presidential primary states in 1920  of which the most crucial to Harding was Ohio  Harding had to have some loyalists at the convention to have any chance of nomination  and the Wood campaign hoped to knock Harding out of the race by taking Ohio  Wood campaigned in the state  and his supporter  Procter  spent large sums  Harding spoke in the nonconfontational style he had adopted in 1914  Harding and Daugherty were so confident of sweeping Ohio s 48 delegates that the candidate went on to the next state  Indiana  before the April 27 Ohio primary    Harding carried Ohio by only 15 000 votes over Wood  taking less than half the total vote  and won only 39 of 48 delegates  In Indiana  Harding finished fourth  with less than ten percent of the vote  and failed to win a single delegate  He was willing to give up and have Daugherty file his nomination papers for the Senate  but Florence Harding grabbed the phone from his hand   Warren Harding  what are you doing  Give up  Not until the convention is over  Think of your friends in Ohio     On learning that Daugherty had left the phone line  the future First Lady retorted   Well  you tell Harry Daugherty for me that we re in this fight until Hell freezes over      After he recovered from the shock of the poor results  Harding traveled to Boston  where he delivered a speech that according to Dean   would resonate throughout the 1920 campaign and history     There  he stated that  America s present need is not heroics  but healing  not nostrums  but normalcy    c   not revolution  but restoration     Dean notes   Harding  more than the other aspirants  was reading the nation s pulse correctly      The 1920 Republican National Convention opened at the Chicago Coliseum on June 8  1920  assembling delegates who were bitterly divided  most recently over the results of a Senate investigation into campaign spending  which had just been released  That report found that Wood had spent  1 8 million  lending substance to Johnson claims that Wood was trying to buy the presidency  Some of the  600 000 that Lowden had spent had wound up in the pockets of two convention delegates  Johnson had spent  194 000 and Harding  113 000  Johnson was deemed to be behind the inquiry  and the rage of the Lowden and Wood factions put an end to any possible compromise among the frontrunners  Of the almost 1 000 delegates  27 were womenthe Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution   guaranteeing women the vote  was within one state of ratification  and would pass before the end of August      The convention had no boss  most uninstructed delegates voted as they pleased  and with a Democrat in the White House  the party s leaders could not use patronage to get their way     Reporters deemed Harding unlikely to be nominated due to his poor showing in the primaries  and relegated him to a place among the dark horses     Harding  who like the other candidates was in Chicago supervising his campaign  had finished sixth in the final public opinion poll  behind the three main candidates as well as former justice Hughes and Herbert Hoover  and only slightly ahead of Coolidge       After the convention dealt with other matters  the nominations for president opened on the morning of Friday  June 11  Harding had asked Willis to place his name in nomination  and the former governor responded with a speech popular among the delegates both for its folksiness and for its brevity in the intense Chicago heat    Reporter Mark Sullivan  who was present  called it a splendid combination of  oratory  grand opera  and hog calling    Willis concluded  leaning over the podium railing   Say  boysand girls toowhy not name Warren Harding     The laughter and applause that followed created a warm feeling for Harding     I don t expect Senator Harding to be nominated on the first  second  or third ballots  but I think we can well afford to take chances that about eleven minutes after two o clock on Friday morning at the convention  when fifteen or twenty men  somewhat weary  are sitting around a table  some one of them will say   Who will we nominate   At that decisive time  the friends of Senator Harding can suggest him and afford to abide by the result   Four ballots were taken on the afternoon of June 11  and they revealed a deadlock  With 493 votes needed to nominate  Wood was the closest with 314 1   2   Lowdon had 289 1   2   The best Harding had done was 65 1   2   Chairman Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts  the Senate Majority Leader   adjourned the convention about 7p m       The night of June 1112  1920 would become famous in political history as the night of the   smoke filled room    in which  legend has it  party elders agreed to force the convention to nominate Harding  Historians have focused on the talks held in the suite of Republican National Committee  RNC  Chairman Will Hays at the Blackstone Hotel   at which senators and others came and went  and numerous possible candidates were discussed  Utah Senator Reed Smoot   before his departure early in the evening  backed Harding  telling Hays and the others that as the Democrats were likely to nominate Governor Cox  they should pick Harding to win Ohio  Smoot also told The New York Times that there had been an agreement to nominate Harding  but that it would not be done for several ballots yet    This was not true  a number of participants backed Harding  others supported his rivals   but there was no pact to nominate him  and the senators had little power to enforce any agreement  Two other participants in the smoke filled room discussions  Kansas Senator Charles Curtis and Colonel George Brinton McClellan Harvey   a close friend of Hays  predicted to the press that Harding would be nominated because of the liabilities of the other candidates     Colonel Harvey s account of the smoke filled room had Harding being sent for in the early morning hours  to be informed by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate  Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding s background that might harm his candidacy  to which the senator  who had had at least one extramarital affair  replied there was not  Harding biographer Charles W  Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey s word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night  and that other participants denied that Harding was there    Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re election to the Senate  though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him       The reassembled delegates had heard rumors that Harding was the choice of a cabal of senators  Although this was not true  delegates believed it  and sought a way out by voting for Harding  When balloting resumed on the morning of June 12  Harding gained votes on each of the next four ballots  rising to 133 1   2 as the two frontrunners saw little change  Lodge then declared a three hour recess  to the outrage of Daugherty  who raced to the podium and confronted him   You cannot defeat this man this way  The motion was not carried  You cannot defeat this man     Lodge and others used the break to try to stop the Harding momentum and make RNC Chairman Hays the nominee  a scheme Hays refused to have anything to do with    The ninth ballot  after some initial suspense  saw delegation after delegation break for Harding  who took the lead with 374 1   2 votes to 249 for Wood and 121 1   2 for Lowden  Johnson had 83   Lowden released his delegates to Harding  and the tenth ballot  held at 6p m   was a mere formality  with Harding finishing with 672 1   5 votes to 156 for Wood  The nomination was made unanimous  The delegates  desperate to leave town before they incurred more hotel expenses  then proceeded to the vice presidential nomination  Harding wanted Senator Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin  who was unwilling to run  but before Lenroot s name could be withdrawn and another man decided on  an Oregon delegate proposed Governor Coolidge  which was met with a roar of approval from the delegates  Coolidge  popular for his role in breaking the Boston police strike of 1919  was nominated for vice president  receiving two and a fraction votes more than Harding had  James Morgan wrote in The Boston Globe    The delegates would not listen to remaining in Chicago over Sunday    the President makers did not have a clean shirt  On such things  Rollo  turns the destiny of nations        The Harding Coolidge ticket was quickly backed by Republican newspapers  but those of other viewpoints expressed disappointment  The New York World found Harding the least qualified candidate since James Buchanan   deeming the Ohio senator a  weak and mediocre  man who  never had an original idea     The Hearst newspapers called Harding  the flag bearer of a new Senatorial autocracy     The New York Times described the Republican presidential candidate as  a very respectable Ohio politician of the second class      The Democratic National Convention opened in San Francisco on June 28  1920  under a shadow cast by Woodrow Wilson  who wished to be nominated for a third term  Delegates were convinced Wilson s health would not permit him to serve  and looked elsewhere for a candidate  Former Treasury Secretary William G  McAdoo was a major contender  but he was Wilson s son in law  and refused to consider a nomination so long as the president wanted it  Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway  and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General A  Mitchell Palmer   On the 44thballot  the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president  with his running mate Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D  Roosevelt   As Cox was  when not in politics  a newspaper owner and editor  this placed two Ohio editors against each other for the presidency  and some complained there was no real political choice  Both Cox and Harding were economic conservatives  and were reluctant progressives at best     Harding elected to conduct a front porch campaign   like McKinley in 1896    Some years earlier  Harding had had his front porch remodeled to resemble McKinley s  which his neighbors felt signified presidential ambitions    The candidate remained at home in Marion and gave addresses to visiting delegations  In the meantime  Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation  giving hundreds of speeches  Coolidge spoke in the Northeast  later on in the South  and was not a significant factor in the campaign     In Marion  Harding ran his campaign  As a newspaperman himself  he fell into easy camaraderie with the press covering him  enjoying a relationship few presidents have equaled  His   Return to Normalcy   theme was aided by the atmosphere that Marion provided  an orderly place that induced nostalgia in many voters  The front porch campaign allowed Harding to avoid mistakes  and as time dwindled towards the election  his strength grew  The travels of the Democratic candidates eventually caused Harding to make several short speaking tours  but for the most part  he remained in Marion  America had no need for another Wilson  Harding argued  appealing for a president  near the normal      Harding s vague oratory irritated some  McAdoo described a typical Harding speech as  an army of pompous phrases moving over the landscape in search of an idea  Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly  a prisoner in their midst  until it died of servitude and over work     H  L  Mencken concurred   it reminds me of a string of wet sponges  it reminds me of tattered washing on the line  it reminds me of stale bean soup  of college yells  of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights  It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it  It drags itself out of the dark abysm    of pish  and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh  It is rumble and bumble  It is balder and dash    d     The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding s speeches  stating that in them the majority of people could find  a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts      Wilson had stated that the 1920 election would be a  great and solemn referendum  on the League of Nations  making it difficult for Cox to maneuver on the issuealthough Roosevelt strongly supported the League  Cox was less enthusiastic    Harding opposed entry into the League of Nations as negotiated by Wilson  but favored an  association of nations     based on the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague   This was general enough to satisfy most Republicans  and only a few bolted the party over this issue  By October  Cox had realized there was widespread public opposition to Article X  and stated that reservations to the treaty might be necessary  this shift allowed Harding to say no more on the subject     The RNC hired Albert Lasker   an advertising executive from Chicago  to publicize Harding  and Lasker unleashed a broad based advertising campaign that used many now standard advertising techniques for the first time in a presidential campaign  Lasker s approach included newsreels and sound recordings  Visitors to Marion had their photographs taken with Senator and Mrs  Harding  and copies were sent to their hometown newspapers    Billboard posters  newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures  Telemarketers were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding     The rumors that the Hardings were of partially African American blood surfaced again in the last days of the campaign  promoted by Wooster College professor William Estabrook Chancellor   Once these claims became known  reporters filed lengthy stories on them from Marion  which their editors declined to print  The Harding campaign refused to acknowledge or respond to the allegations     By Election Day  November 2  1920  few had any doubts that the Republican ticket would win    Harding received 60 2percent of the popular vote  the highest percentage since the evolution of the two party system   and 404 electoral votes   Cox received 34percent of the national vote and 127 electoral votes    Campaigning from a federal prison where he was serving a sentence for opposing the war  Socialist Eugene V  Debs received 3percent of the national vote  The Republicans greatly increased their majority in each house of Congress       Warren Harding was sworn in as president on March 4  1921  in the presence of his wife and father  Harding preferred a low key inauguration  without the customary parade  leaving only the swearing in ceremony and a brief reception at the White House  In his inaugural address he declared   Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much from the government and at the same time do too little for it      After the election  Harding had announced he was going on vacation  and that no decisions about appointments would be made until he returned to Marion in December  He went to Texas  where he fished and played golf with his friend Frank Scobey  soon to be Director of the Mint    then took ship for the Panama Canal Zone   He went to Washington  where he was given a hero s welcome   e   when Congress opened in early December as the first sitting senator to be elected to the White House  Back in Ohio  he planned to consult the  best minds  of the country on appointments  and they duly journeyed to Marion to offer their counsel       Harding chose pro League Charles Evans Hughes as his Secretary of State  ignoring advice from Senator Lodge and others  After Charles G  Dawes declined the Treasury position  Harding asked Pittsburgh banker Andrew W  Mellon   one of the richest men in the country  he agreed  Harding appointed Herbert Hoover as United States Secretary of Commerce     RNC Chairman Will Hays was made Postmaster General   then a cabinet post  he would leave after a year in the position to become chief censor to the motion picture industry     The two Harding cabinet appointees who darkened the reputation of his administration for their involvement in scandal were Harding s Senate friend  Albert B  Fall of New Mexico  the Interior Secretary   and Daugherty  who became Attorney General  Fall was a Western rancher and former miner  and was pro development    He was opposed by conservationists such as Gifford Pinchot   who wrote   it would have been possible to pick a worse man for Secretary of the Interior  but not altogether easy     The New York Times mocked the Daugherty appointment  stating that rather than select one of the best minds  Harding had been content  to choose merely a best friend     Eugene P  Trani and David L  Wilson  in their volume on Harding s presidency  suggest that the appointment made sense then  since Daugherty was  a competent lawyer well acquainted with the seamy side of politics    a first class political troubleshooter and someone Harding could trust      Harding made it clear when he appointed Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy  a change from Wilson s close management of international affairs    Hughes had to work within some broad outlines  after taking office  Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations  deciding the U S  would not join even a scaled down version of the League  With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate  the U S  remained technically at war with Germany  Austria  and Hungary  Peacemaking began with the KnoxPorter Resolution   declaring the U S  at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles  Treaties with Germany   Austria and Hungary   each containing many of the non League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles  were ratified in 1921     This still left the question of relations between the U S  and the League  Hughes  State Department initially ignored communications from the League  or tried to bypass it through direct dealings with member nations  By 1922  though  the U S   through its consul in Geneva  was dealing with the League  and though the U S  refused to participate in any meeting with political implications  it sent observers to sessions dealing with technical and humanitarian matters     By the time Harding took office  there were calls from foreign governments for reduction of the massive war debt owed to the United States  and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay  The U S  refused to consider any multilateral settlement  Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation  but Congress in 1922 passed a more restrictive bill  Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest  effectively reducing the present value of the obligations  This agreement  approved by Congress in 1923  set a pattern for negotiations with other nations  Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would in 1924 result in the Dawes plan      A pressing issue not resolved by Wilson was the question of policy towards Bolshevik Russia  The U S  had been among the nations that had sent troops there after the Russian Revolution   Afterwards  Wilson refused to recognize Russia  Under Harding  Commerce Secretary Hoover  with considerable experience of Russian affairs  took the lead on policy  When famine struck Russia in 1921   Hoover had the American Relief Administration   which he had headed  negotiate with the Russians to provide aid  Soviet leaders  the U S S R  was established in 1922  hoped in vain that the agreement would lead to recognition  Hoover supported trade with Russia  fearing U S  companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market  but Hughes opposed this  and the matter was not resolved under Harding s presidency     Harding had urged disarmament  and lower defense costs  during the campaign  but it had not been a major issue  He gave a speech to a joint session of Congress in April 1921  setting out his legislative priorities  Among the few foreign policy matters he mentioned was disarmament  with the president stating that the government could not  be unmindful of the call for reduced expenditure  on defense     Idaho Senator William Borah had proposed a conference at which the major naval powers  the U S   Britain  and Japan  would agree to cuts in their fleets  Harding concurred  and after some diplomatic discussions  representatives of nine nations convened in Washington in November 1921  Most of the diplomats first attended Armistice Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery   where Harding spoke at the entombment of the Unknown Soldier of World War I   whose identity   took flight with his imperishable soul  We know not whence he came  only that his death marks him with the everlasting glory of an American dying for his country      Hughes  in his speech at the opening session of the conference on November 12  1921  made the American proposalthe U S would decommission or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels  and Japan 17 ships    The secretary was generally successful  and agreements were reached on this and other points  including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific  and limitations on the use of poison gas  The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers  and in the end did not prevent rearmament  Nevertheless  Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work  Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader   Alabama s Oscar Underwood   to the U S  delegation  they helped ensure that the treaties made it through the Senate mostly unscathed  though that body added reservations to some of the treaties       The U S  had acquired over a thousand vessels during World War I  and still owned most of them when Harding took office  Congress had authorized their disposal in 1920   but the Senate would not confirm Wilson s nominees to the Shipping Board   Harding appointed Albert Lasker as its chairman  the advertising executive undertook to run the fleet as profitably as possible until it could be sold  Most ships proved impossible to sell at anything approaching the government s cost  Lasker recommended a large subsidy to the merchant marine to enable the sales  and Harding repeatedly urged Congress to enact it  Unpopular in the Midwest  the bill passed the House but was defeated by a filibuster in the Senate  and most government ships were eventually scrapped     Intervention in Latin America had been a minor campaign issue  Harding spoke against Wilson s decision to send U S  troops to the Dominican Republic and Haiti  and attacked the Democratic vice presidential candidate  Franklin Roosevelt  for his role in the Haitian intervention  Once Harding was sworn in  Hughes worked to improve relations with Latin American countries who were wary of the American use of the Monroe Doctrine to justify intervention  at the time of Harding s inauguration  the U S  also had troops in Cuba and Nicaragua  The troops stationed in Cuba to protect American interests were withdrawn in 1921  U S  forces remained in the other three nations through Harding s presidency    f     In April 1921  Harding gained the ratification of the ThomsonUrrutia Treaty with Colombia  granting that nation  25 000 000 as settlement for the U S  provoked Panamanian revolution of 1903     The Latin American nations were not fully satisfied  as the U S  refused to renounce interventionism  though Hughes pledged to limit it to nations near the Panama Canal and to make it clear what the U S  aims were     The U S  had intervened repeatedly in Mexico under Wilson  and had withdrawn diplomatic recognition  setting conditions for reinstatement  The Mexican government under President lvaro Obregn wanted recognition before negotiations  but Wilson and his Secretary of State  Bainbridge Colby   refused  Both Hughes and Fall opposed recognition  Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to the Mexicans in May 1921  which included pledges to reimburse Americans for losses in Mexico since the 1910 revolution there  Obregn was unwilling to sign a treaty before being recognized  and worked to improve the relationship between American business and Mexico  reaching agreement with creditors  and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States  This had its effect  and by mid 1922  Fall was less influential than he had been  lessening the resistance to recognition  The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal  and the U S  recognized the Obregn government on August 31  1923  just under a month after Harding s death  substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico     When Harding took office on March 4  1921  the nation was in the midst of a postwar economic decline     At the suggestion of its leaders  Harding called a special session of Congress to convene on April 11  When Harding addressed the joint session the following day  he urged the reduction of income taxes  raised during the war   an increase in tariffs on agricultural goods to protect the American farmer  as well as more wide ranging reforms  such as support for highways  aviation  and radio      But it was not until May 27 that Congress passed an emergency tariff increase on agricultural products  An act authorizing a Bureau of the Budget followed on June 10  Harding appointed Charles Dawes as bureau director with a mandate to cut expenditures     Treasury Secretary Mellon also recommended to Congress that income tax rates be cut  He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished  The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon s proposals  but some congressmen  who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations  fought the measure  Harding was unsure what side to endorse  telling a friend   I can t make a damn thing out of this tax problem  I listen to one side  and they seem right  and thenGod I talk to the other side  and they seem just as right     Harding tried compromise  and gained passage of the bill in the House after the end of the excess profits tax was delayed a year  In the Senate  the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier s bonus  Frustrated by the delays  on July 12  Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus  It was not until November that the bill finally passed  with higher rates than Mellon had proposed       Harding had opposed payment of a bonus to veterans  arguing in his Senate address that much was already being done for them by a grateful nation  and that the bill would  break down our Treasury  from which so much is later on to be expected     The Senate sent the bonus bill back to committee    but the issue returned when Congress reconvened in December 1921  A bill providing a bonus  without a means of funding it  was passed by both houses in September 1922  Harding vetoed it  and the veto was narrowly sustained  A bonus   not payable in cash  was voted to soldiers despite Coolidge s veto in 1924     In his first annual message to Congress   Harding sought the power to adjust tariff rates  The passage of the tariff bill in the Senate  and in conference committee became a feeding frenzy of lobbyist interests    Harding  when he enacted the FordneyMcCumber Tariff Act on September 21  1922  made a brief signing statement   praising only that the bill gave him some power to adjust rates    According to Trani and Wilson  the bill was  ill considered  It wrought havoc in international commerce and made the repayment of war debts more difficult      The 1920s were a time of modernization for America  Use of electricity became increasingly common  Mass production of the motor car stimulated other industries  as well  such as highway construction  rubber  steel  and building  as hotels were erected to accommodate the tourists venturing upon the roads  This economic boost helped bring the nation out of the recession    To improve and expand the nation s highway system  Harding signed the Federal Highway Act of 1921   From 1921 to 1923  the federal government spent  162million on America s highway system  infusing the U S  economy with a large amount of capital    In 1922  Harding proclaimed that America was in the age of the  motor car   which  reflects our standard of living and gauges the speed of our present day life      Harding had urged regulation of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress    Commerce Secretary Hoover took charge of this project  and convened a conference of radio broadcasters in 1922  which led to a voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department   Both Harding and Hoover realized something more than an agreement was needed  but Congress was slow to act  not imposing radio regulation until 1927     Harding also wished to promote aviation  and Hoover again took the lead  convening a national conference on commercial aviation  The discussions focused on safety matters  inspection of airplanes  and licensing of pilots  Harding again promoted legislation but nothing was done until 1926  when the Air Commerce Act created the Bureau of Aeronautics within Hoover s Commerce Department     Harding s attitude toward business was that government should aid it as much as possible    He was suspicious of organized labor   viewing it as a conspiracy against business    He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover s recommendation  Harding warned in his opening address that no federal money would be available  No important legislation came as a result  though some public works projects were speeded up     Within broad limits  Harding allowed each cabinet secretary to run his department as he saw fit    Hoover expanded the Commerce Department to make it more useful to business  This was consistent with Hoover s view that the private sector should take the lead in managing the economy    Harding greatly respected his Commerce Secretary  often asked his advice  and backed him to the hilt  calling Hoover  the smartest   gink   I know     Widespread strikes marked 1922  as labor sought redress for falling wages and increased unemployment  In April  500 000 coal miners  led by John L  Lewis   struck over wage cuts  Mining executives argued that the industry was seeing hard times  Lewis accused them of trying to break the union  As the strike became protracted  Harding offered compromise to settle it  As Harding proposed  the miners agreed to return to work  and Congress created a commission to look into their grievances     On July 1  1922  400 000 railroad workers went on strike  Harding proposed a settlement that made some concessions  but management objected  Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H  Wilkerson to issue a sweeping injunction to break up the strike  Although there was public support for the Wilkerson injunction  Harding felt it went too far  and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it  The injunction succeeded in ending the strike  however  tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years     By 1922  the eight hour day had become common in American industry  One exception was in steel mills   where workers labored through a twelve hour workday  seven days a week  Hoover considered this practice barbaric  and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers with a view to ending it  The conference established a committee under the leadership of U  S  Steel chairman Elbert Gary   which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice  Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result  which was printed in the press  and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight hour day     Although Harding s first address to Congress called for passage of anti lynching legislation    he initially seemed inclined to do no more for African Americans than had Republican presidents of the recent past  he asked cabinet officers to find places for blacks in their departments  Sinclair suggested that the fact that Harding received two fifths of the Southern vote in 1920 led him to see political opportunity for his party in the Solid South   On October 26  1921  Harding gave a speech in Birmingham  Alabama   to a segregated audience of 20 000 whites and 10 000 blacks  Harding  while stating that the social and racial differences between whites and blacks could not be bridged  urged equal political rights for the African American  Many African Americans at that time voted Republican  especially in the Democratic South  and Harding stated he did not mind seeing that support end if the result was a strong two party system in the South  He was willing to see literacy tests for voting continue  if applied fairly to white and black     Whether you like it or not   Harding told his segregated audience   unless our democracy is a lie  you must stand for that equality     The white section of the audience listened in silence while the black section cheered     Harding had spoken out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress and supported Congressman Leonidas Dyer  s federal anti lynching bill   which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922    When it reached the Senate floor in November 1922  it was filibustered by Southern Democrats  and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated  it was likewise filibustered   Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill s defeat  Harding biographer Robert K  Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding s desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered     With the public suspicious of immigrants  especially ones who might be Socialists or Communists  Congress passed the Per Centum Act of 1921   signed by Harding on May 19  1921  as a quick means of restricting immigration  The act reduced the numbers of immigrants to 3  of those from a given country living in the U S   based on the 1910 census  This would  in practice  not restrict immigration from Ireland and Germany  but would bar many Italians and eastern European Jews    Harding and Secretary of Labor James Davis believed that enforcement had to be humane  and at the secretary s recommendation  Harding allowed almost a thousand deportable immigrants to remain    Coolidge signed a bill permanently restricting immigration to the U S  in 1924     Harding s Socialist opponent in the 1920 election  Eugene Debs  was serving a ten year sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for speaking against the war  Wilson had refused to pardon him before leaving office  Daugherty met with Debs  and was deeply impressed  There was opposition from veterans  including the American Legion   and also from Florence Harding  The president did not feel he could release Debs until the war was officially over  but once the peace treaties were signed commuted Debs  sentence on December 23  1921  At Harding s request  Debs visited the president at the White House before going home to Indiana     Harding released 23 other war opponents at the same time as Debs  and continued to review cases and release political prisoners throughout his presidency  Harding defended his prisoner releases as necessary to return the nation to normalcy     Harding appointed four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States   When Chief Justice Edward Douglass White died in May 1921  Harding was unsure whether to appoint former president Taft or former Utah senator George Sutherland he had promised seats on the court to both men  After briefly considering awaiting another vacancy and appointing them both  he chose Taft as chief justice  Sutherland was appointed to the court in 1922  to be followed by two other economic conservatives  Pierce Butler and Edward Terry Sanford   in 1923     Harding also appointed six judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   42 judges to the United States district courts   and two judges to the United States Court of Customs Appeals      Entering the 1922 midterm congressional election campaign  Harding and the Republicans had followed through on many of their campaign promises  But some of the fulfilled pledges  like cutting taxes for the well off  did not appeal to the electorate  The economy had not returned to normalcy  with unemployment at 11percent  and organized labor angry over the outcome of the strikes  From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920  the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221213 majority  In the Senate  the Republicans lost eight seats  and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress  which Harding did not survive to meet     A month after the election  the lame duck session of the old 67th Congress met  Harding had come to believe that his early view of the presidency  that it should propose policies  but leave whether to adopt them to Congress  was not enough  and he lobbied Congress  although in vain  to get his ship subsidy bill through    Once Congress left town in early March 1923  Harding s popularity in the country began to recover  The economy was improving  and the programs of Harding s more able cabinet members  such as Hughes  Mellon  and Hoover  were showing results  Most Republicans realized that there was no practical alternative to supporting Harding in 1924     In the first half of 1923  Harding did two acts that were later said to indicate foreknowledge of death  he sold the Star  though undertaking to remain as a contributing editor for ten years after his presidency   and made a new will    Harding had long suffered occasional health problems  but when he was not experiencing symptoms he tended to eat  drink  and smoke too much  By 1919  he was aware he had a heart condition  Stress caused by the presidency and by Florence Harding s ill health  she had a chronic kidney condition  debilitated him  and he never really recovered from an episode of influenza in January 1923  After that  Harding  an avid golfer  had difficulty completing a round  In June 1923  Ohio Senator Willis met with Harding  but brought to the president s attention only two of the five items he intended to discuss  When asked why  Willis responded   Warren seemed so tired      In June 1923  Harding set out on a journey  which he dubbed the  Voyage of Understanding     The president planned to cross the country  go north to Alaska Territory   journey south along the West Coast  then travel by Navy ship through the Panama Canal  to Puerto Rico  and to return to Washington at the end of August    Harding loved to travel and had long contemplated a trip to Alaska    The trip would allow him to speak widely across the country  to politic and bloviate in advance of the 1924 campaign  and allow him some rest   away from Washington s oppressive summer heat     Harding s political advisers had given him a physically demanding schedule  even though the president had ordered it cut back    In Kansas City  Harding spoke on transportation issues  in Hutchinson  Kansas   agriculture was the theme  In Denver  he spoke on Prohibition  and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until Franklin Roosevelt  Harding had become a supporter of the World Court  and wanted the U S  to become a member  In addition to making speeches  he visited Yellowstone and Zion National Parks     and dedicated a monument on the Oregon Trail at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer Ezra Meeker and others     On July 5  Harding embarked on the USS Henderson in Washington state  The first president to visit Alaska  he spent hours watching the dramatic landscapes from the deck of the Henderson     After several stops along the coast  the presidential party left the ship at Seward to take the Alaska Central Railway to McKinley Park and Fairbanks   where he addressed a crowd of 1 500 in 94F  34C  heat  The party was to return to Seward by the Richardson Trail but due to Harding s fatigue  it went by train     On July 26  1923  Harding toured Vancouver   British Columbia as the first sitting American president to visit Canada    Harding visited a golf course  but completed only six holes before being fatigued  After resting  he played the 17th and 18th holes so it would appear he completed the round  He was not successful in hiding his exhaustion  one reporter deemed him so tired a rest of mere days would not be sufficient to refresh him     In Seattle the next day  Harding kept up his busy schedule  giving a speech to 25 000 people at the stadium at the University of Washington   In the final speech he gave  Harding predicted statehood for Alaska    The president rushed through his speech  not waiting for applause by the audience     Harding went to bed early in the evening of July 27  1923  Later that night  he called for his physician  Charles E  Sawyer   complaining of pain in the upper abdomen  Sawyer thought it was a recurrence of a dietary upset  but Dr  Joel T  Boone suspected a heart problem  The next day  as the train rushed to San Francisco  Harding felt better  and when they arrived on the morning of July 29  1923  Harding insisted on walking from the train to the car  which rushed him to the Palace Hotel     where he suffered a relapse  Doctors found that not only was Harding s heart causing problems  but he also had pneumonia   a serious matter in the days before effective antibiotics  When treated with caffeine and digitalis   Harding seemed to improve  He was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception  By the afternoon of August 2  1923  doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed  That evening  about 7 30 pm  he was listening to his wife read him a flattering article about him from The Saturday Evening Post    A Calm Review of a Calm Man   When she paused to plump his pillows  he said   That s good  read some more   As Florence Harding resumed  her husband twisted convulsively and collapsed  and she raced to get the doctors  They attempted stimulants  but were unable to revive him  and President Harding died of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 2  1923  at the age of 57       Harding s death came as a great shock to the nation  The president was liked and admired  and the press and public had followed his illness closely  and been reassured by his apparent recovery    Harding was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed closely in the newspapers  Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding s body was taken from San Francisco to Washington  D C   and after services there  home to Marion  Ohio  for burial     In Marion  the body of Warren Harding was placed on a horse drawn hearse  which was followed by President Coolidge and Chief Justice Taft  then by Harding s wife and father    They followed it through the city  past the Star building where the presses stood silent  and at last to the Marion Cemetery  where the casket was placed in the cemetery s receiving vault       Harding s body  along with that of his wife who died in 1924  rests today in the Harding Tomb   which was dedicated in 1931 by President Hoover     Harding appointed a number of friends and acquaintances to federal positions  Some served competently  such as Charles E  Sawyer   the Hardings  personal physician from Marion who attended to them in the White House  Sawyer had alerted Harding to the Veterans  Bureau scandal  Others proved ineffective in office  such as Daniel R  Crissinger   a Marion lawyer whom Harding made Comptroller of the Currency and later a governor of the Federal Reserve Board   or Harding s old friend  Director of the Mint Frank Scobey  whom Trani and Wilson noted  did little damage during his tenure     Harding s brother in law  Heber H  Votaw  superintendent of federal prisons  was unable to root out the drug trade from within the facilities    Others of these associates  who were later dubbed the   Ohio Gang    proved corrupt     Most of the scandals that have marred the reputation of Harding s administration did not emerge until after his death  The Veterans  Bureau scandal was known to Harding in January 1923  but according to Trani and Wilson   the president s handling of it did him little credit     Harding allowed the corrupt director of the bureau  Charles R  Forbes   to flee to Europe  though he later returned and served prison time    Harding had learned that Daugherty s factotum at the Justice Department  Jess Smith   was involved in corruption  The president ordered Daugherty to get Smith out of Washington and removed Smith s name from the upcoming presidential trip to Alaska  Smith committed suicide on May 30  1923    It is uncertain how much Harding knew about Smith s illicit activities    Murray noted that Harding was not involved in the corruption  and did not condone it     Hoover  who accompanied Harding on the Western trip  later wrote that Harding asked then what Hoover would do if he knew of some great scandal  whether to publicize it or bury it  Hoover replied that Harding should publish and get credit for integrity  and asked for details  Harding stated that it had to do with Smith  but when Hoover enquired as to Daugherty s possible involvement  Harding refused to answer     The scandal which has likely done the greatest damage to Harding s reputation is Teapot Dome   Like most of the administration s scandals  it came to light after Harding s death  and he was not aware of the illegal aspects  Teapot Dome involved an oil reserve in Wyoming which was one of three set aside for the use of the Navy in a national emergency  There was a longstanding argument that the reserves should be developed  Wilson s first Interior Secretary  Franklin Knight Lane   was an advocate of this position  When the Harding administration took office  Interior Secretary Fall took up Lane s argument and in May 1921 Harding signed an executive order transferring the reserves from the Navy Department to Interior  This was done with the consent of Navy Secretary Edwin C  Denby        An announcement by the Interior Department in July 1921 that Edward Doheny had been awarded a lease to drill along the edges of a naval reserve  Elk Hills in California  attracted little controversy as the oil would have been lost to wells on adjacent private land    Wyoming Senator John Kendrick had heard from constituents that Teapot Dome had also been leased  but no announcement had been made  When the Interior Department refused to provide documentation  he secured the passage of a Senate resolution compelling disclosure  The department sent a copy of the lease granting drilling rights to Harry Sinclair  s Mammoth Oil Company   along with a statement that there had been no competitive bidding because military preparedness was involvedMammoth was to build oil tanks for the Navy as part of the deal  This satisfied most people  but some conservationists such as Gifford Pinchot   Harry A  Slattery and others disliked Fall for his pro development views and continued to push the issue  They got Wisconsin Senator Robert M  La Follette Sr  to begin a Senate investigation into the oil leases  La Follette persuaded Democratic Montana Senator Thomas J  Walsh to lead the investigation  and Walsh  through 1922 into 1923  read through the truckload of material provided by the Interior Department  including a letter from Harding stating that the transfer and leases had been with his knowledge and approval     Hearings into Teapot Dome began in October 1923  after Harding s death  Fall  who had left office earlier that year  denied receiving any money from Sinclair or Doheny  Sinclair  who also appeared  agreed  The following month  Walsh learned that Fall had spent lavishly on expanding and improving his New Mexico ranch  Fall reappeared and stated the money had come as a loan from Harding friend and The Washington Post publisher Edward B  McLean   but McLean  when he testified  denied it  Doheny told the committee that he had lent Fall the money  in cash  as a personal loan out of regard for their past association  but Fall  when compelled to appear again  invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination rather than answer questions     Investigators found that Fall and a relative had received a total of about  400 000 from Doheny and Sinclair  and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases    Fall was ultimately convicted in 1929 for accepting bribes  and in 1931  became the first U S  cabinet member to be imprisoned for crimes committed while in office    Sinclair was convicted only of contempt of court for jury tampering   Doheny  brought to trial before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting  was acquitted     Harding s appointment of Harry M  Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other  Daugherty s Ohio lobbying and back room maneuvers were not considered to qualify him for his office    When the scandals broke in 1923 and 1924  Daugherty s many enemies were delighted at the prospect of connecting him with the dishonesty  and assumed he had taken part in Teapot Dome  though Fall and Daugherty were not friends  In February 1924  the Senate voted to investigate the Justice Department  where Daugherty remained Attorney General     Democratic Montana Senator Burton K  Wheeler was on the investigating committee and assumed the role of prosecutor when hearings began on March 12  1924    Smith had engaged in influence peddling before his suicide  conspiring with two other Ohioans  Howard Mannington and Fred A  Caskey  to accept payoffs from bootleggers to secure immunity from prosecution or to secure the release of liquor from government warehouses  Cannington and Caskey s residence became infamous as the Little Green House on K Street     Some witnesses  such as Smith s divorced wife Roxy Stinson  and corrupt former FBI agent Gaston Means   alleged that Daugherty was personally involved  Coolidge requested Daugherty s resignation when the Attorney General indicated that he would not allow Wheeler s committee access to Justice Department records  and Daugherty complied on March 28  1924     The illicit activity that caused Daugherty the most problems was a Smith deal with Colonel Thomas W  Miller   a former Delaware congressman  whom Harding had appointed Alien Property Custodian   Smith and Miller received a payoff of almost half a million dollars for getting a German owned firm  the American Metal Company  released to new U S  owners  Smith deposited  50 000 in a joint account with Daugherty  used for political purposes  Records relating to that account were destroyed by Daugherty and his brother  Miller and Daugherty were indicted for defrauding the government  The first trial  in September 1926  resulted in a hung jury   at the second  early in 1927  Miller was convicted and served prison time  but the jury again hung as to Daugherty  Though charges against Daugherty were then dropped  and he was never convicted of any offense  his refusal to take the stand in his own defense devastated what was left of his reputation  The former Attorney General remained defiant  blaming his troubles on his enemies in the labor movement and on the Communists  and wrote that he had  done nothing that prevents my looking the whole world in the face        Charles R  Forbes   the energetic director of the Veterans  Bureau  sought to consolidate control of veterans  hospitals and their construction in his bureau  At the start of Harding s presidency  this power was vested in the Treasury Department  The politically powerful American Legion backed Forbes and denigrated those who opposed him  like Secretary Mellon  and in April 1922  Harding agreed to transfer control to the Veterans  Bureau    Forbes  main task was to ensure that new hospitals were built around the country to help the 300 000 wounded World War I veterans     Near the beginning of 1922  Forbes had met Elias Mortimer  agent for the Thompson Black Construction Company of St  Louis  which wanted to construct the hospitals  The two men became close  and Mortimer paid for Forbes  travels through the West  looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans  Forbes was also friendly with Charles F  Hurley  owner of the Hurley Mason Construction Company of Washington state    Harding had ordered that all contracts be pursuant to public notice    but the three worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided three ways  Some of the money went to the bureau s chief counsel  Charles F  Cramer    Forbes defrauded the government in this hospital construction  increasing construction costs from  3 000 to  4 000 per bed    A tenth of the inflated construction billings was set aside for the conspirators  with Forbes receiving a third of the take    The graft spread to land acquisition  with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract for  105 000 that was worth less than  20 000  At least  25 000 of the excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer     Intent on making more money  Forbes in November 1922 began selling valuable hospital supplies under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot in Maryland    The government had stockpiled huge quantities of hospital supplies during the first World War  which Forbes unloaded for a fraction of their cost to the Boston firm of Thompson and Kelly at a time when the Veterans  Bureau was buying supplies for the hospitals at a much higher price     The check on Forbes  authority at Perryville was Dr  Sawyer  Harding s physician and chairman of the Federal Hospitalization Board    Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor    At first Harding did not believe it  but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923    A shocked Harding  who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration  summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation  Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe  from where he resigned on February 15  1923  In spite of Harding s efforts  gossip about Forbes  activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later    and in mid March  Cramer committed suicide     Mortimer was willing to tell all  as Forbes had had an affair with his wife  which also broke up the Forbes marriage   The construction executive was the star witness at the hearings in late 1923  after Harding s death  Forbes returned from Europe to testify  but convinced few  and in 1924  he and John W  Thompson  of ThompsonBlack  were tried in Chicago for conspiracy to defraud the government  Both were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison  Forbes began to serve his sentence in 1926  Thompson  who had a bad heart  died that year before commencing his    According to Trani and Wilson   One of the most troublesome aspects of the Harding presidency was that he appeared to be far more concerned with political liabilities of a scandal than in securing justice      Harding had an extramarital affair with Carrie Fulton Phillips of Marion  which lasted about fifteen years before ending in 1920  Letters from Harding to Phillips were discovered by Harding biographer Francis Russell in the possession of Marion attorney Donald Williamson while Russell was researching his book in 1963  Before that  the affair was not generally known  Williamson donated the letters to the Ohio Historical Society   Some there wanted the letters destroyed to preserve what remained of Harding s reputation  A lawsuit ensued  with Harding s heirs claiming copyright over the letters  The case was ultimately settled in 1971  with the letters donated to the Library of Congress   They were sealed until 2014  but before their opening  historians used copies at Case Western Reserve University and in Russell s papers at the University of Wyoming         Russell concluded from the letters that Phillips was the love of Harding s life  the enticements of his mind and body combined in one person     but historian Justin P  Coffey in his 2014 review of Harding biographies criticizes him for  obsess ing  over Harding s sex life      The allegations of Harding s other known mistress  Nan Britton   long remained uncertain  In 1927  Britton  also a Marionite  published The President s Daughter   alleging that her child Elizabeth Ann Blaesing had been fathered by Harding  The book  which was dedicated to  all unwedded mothers  and  their innocent children whose fathers are usually not known to the world   was sold  like pornography  door to door wrapped in brown paper    The late president s reputation had deteriorated since his death in 1923  and many believed Britton    The public was tantalized by salacious details such as Britton s claim that the two had sex in a White House closet  with Secret Service agents posted to ward off intruders    Although part of the public believed her  a jury found against her when she alleged she was libeled by a refutation of her book    According to Harding family lore  the late President was infertile and could not have fathered a child  having suffered from mumps in childhood    Britton maintained that Harding had provided child support of  500 per month for the daughter he never met    but she had destroyed romantic correspondence from him at his request       Harding s biographers  writing while Britton s allegations remained uncertain  differed on their truth  Russell believed them unquestioningly   while Dean  having reviewed Britton s papers at UCLA   dismissed them as unproven    In 2015  the results of DNA comparisons between members of the Harding and Blaesing families conducted by ancestry com indicated that Harding was Elizabeth s father    Sinclair wondered that Harding s infidelity was held so much against him  given that Grover Cleveland was elected president in 1884 although it was known he had a mistress and may have fathered a son out of wedlock     Upon his death  Harding was deeply mourned  He was called a man of peace in many European newspapers  American journalists praised him lavishly  with some describing him as having given his life for his country  His associates were stunned by his demise  Daugherty wrote   I can hardly write about it or allow myself to think about it yet     Hughes stated   I cannot realize that our beloved Chief is no longer with us      Hagiographic accounts of Harding s life quickly followed his death  such as Joe Mitchell Chapple s Life and Times of Warren G  Harding  Our After War President  1924     By then  the scandals were breaking  and the Harding administration soon became a byword for corruption in the view of the public  Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding s historical reputation  Masks in a Pageant by William Allen White mocked and dismissed Harding  as did Samuel Hopkins Adams   fictionalized account of the Harding administration  Revelry     These books depicted Harding s time in office as one of great presidential weakness    The publication of Nan Britton s bestselling book alleging they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem  President Coolidge  not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor  refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb  Hoover  Coolidge s successor  was similarly reluctant  but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931  By that time  with the Great Depression in full swing  Hoover was nearly as discredited as Harding       Adams continued to shape the negative view of Harding with several nonfiction works in the 1930s  culminating with The Incredible EraThe Life and Times of Warren G  Harding  1939  in which he called his subject  an amiable  well meaning third rate Mr  Babbitt   with the equipment of a small town semi educated journalist    It could not work  It did not work     Dean deems the works of White and Adams  remarkably unbalanced and unfair accounts  exaggerating the negative  assigning responsibility to Harding for all wrongs  and denying him credit for anything done right  Today there is considerable evidence refuting their portrayals of Harding  Yet the myth has persisted      The opening of Harding s papers for research in 1964 sparked a small spate of biographies  of which the most controversial was Russell s The Shadow of Blooming Grove  1968   which concluded that the rumors of black ancestry  the  shadow  of the title  deeply affected Harding in his formative years  causing both Harding s conservatism and his desire to get along with everyone  Coffey faults Russell s methods  and deems the biography  largely critical  though not entirely unsympathetic     Murray s The Harding Era  1969  took a more positive view of the president  and put him in the context of his times  Trani and Wilson faulted him for  a tendency to go overboard  in trying to connect Harding with the successful policies of cabinet officers  and for asserting  without sufficient evidence  that a new  more assertive Harding had emerged by 1923     More recently  there have been revisionist books on Harding  Robert Ferrell s The Strange Deaths of President Harding  1996   according to Coffey   spends almost the entire work challenging every story about Harding and concludes that almost everything that is read and taught about his subject is wrong     In 2004  John Dean  noted for his involvement in another presidential scandal  Watergate   wrote the Harding volume in  The American Presidents  series of short biographies  edited by Arthur M  Schlesinger  Jr    Coffey deemed that book the most revisionist to date  and faults Dean for glossing over some unfavorable episodes in Harding s life  like his silence during the 1914 Senate campaign  when his opponent Hogan was being attacked for his faith     Harding has traditionally been ranked as one of the worst presidents     In a 1948 poll conducted by Harvard University   historian Arthur M  Schlesinger  Sr  conducted the first notable survey of scholars  opinions of the presidents  Harding ranked last among the 29 presidents considered    He has also been last in other polls since  which Ferrell attributes to scholars reading little but sensational accounts of Harding    Murray argued that Harding deserves more credit than historians have given   he was certainly the equal of a Franklin Pierce   an Andrew Johnson   a Benjamin Harrison   or even a Calvin Coolidge  In concrete accomplishments  his administration was superior to a sizable portion of those in the nation s history     Coffey believes  the academic lack of interest in Harding has cost him his reputation  as scholars still rank Harding as nearly dead last among presidents      Murray argued that Harding sowed the seeds for his administration s poor standing   In the American system  there is no such thing as an innocent bystander in the White House  If Harding can rightly claim the achievements of a Hughes in State or a Hoover in Commerce  he must also shoulder responsibility for a Daugherty in Justice and a Fall in Interior  Especially must he bear the onus of his lack of punitive action against such men as Forbes and Smith  By his inaction  he forfeited whatever chance he had to maintain the integrity of his position and salvage a favorable image for himself and his administration  As it was  the subsequent popular and scholarly negative verdict was inevitable  if not wholly deserved

Ulysses S  Grant  born Hiram Ulysses Grant   April 27  1822  July 23  1885  was the 18th President of the United States  186977   As Commanding General   Grant worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy in the American Civil War   He implemented Congressional Reconstruction   often at odds with Lincoln s successor  Andrew Johnson   Twice elected president  Grant led the Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery  protect African American citizenship  and support economic prosperity nationwide  His presidency has often come under criticism for tolerating corruption and in his second term leading the nation into a severe economic depression   Grant graduated in 1843 from the U S  Military Academy at West Point   served in the MexicanAmerican War and initially retired in 1854  He struggled financially in civilian life  When the Civil War began in 1861  he rejoined the U S  Army  In 1862  Grant took control of Kentucky and most of Tennessee   and led Union forces to victory in the Battle of Shiloh   earning a reputation as an aggressive commander  He incorporated displaced African American slaves into the Union war effort  In July 1863  after a series of coordinated battles  Grant defeated Confederate armies and seized Vicksburg   giving the Union control of the Mississippi River and dividing the Confederacy in two  After his victories in the Chattanooga Campaign   Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant general and Commanding General of the United States in March 1864  Grant confronted Robert E  Lee in a series of bloody battles  trapping Lee s army in their defense of Richmond   Grant coordinated a series of devastating campaigns in other theaters  In April 1865  Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox   effectively ending the war  Historians have hailed Grant s military genius  and his strategies are featured in military history textbooks  but a minority contend that he won by brute force rather than superior strategy     After the Civil War  Grant led the army s supervision of Reconstruction in the former Confederate states  Elected president in 1868 and reelected in 1872  Grant stabilized the nation during the turbulent Reconstruction period  prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan   and enforced civil and voting rights laws using the army and the Department of Justice   He used the army to build the Republican Party in the South  based on black voters  Northern newcomers    carpetbaggers     and native Southern white supporters    scalawags     After the disenfranchisement of some former Confederates   Republicans gained majorities and African Americans were elected to Congress and high state offices  In his second term  the Republican coalitions in the South splintered and were defeated one by one as redeemers  conservative whites  regained control using coercion and violence  Grant s Indian peace policy initially reduced frontier violence  but is best known for the Great Sioux War of 1876   where George Custer and his regiment were killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn   Throughout his presidency Grant was faced with charges of corruption in executive agencies  including congressional investigations of two cabinet secretaries   In foreign policy  Grant sought to increase American trade and influence  while remaining at peace with the world  His administration successfully resolved the Alabama Claims with Great Britain  ending wartime tensions  Grant avoided war with Spain over the Virginius Affair   but Congress rejected his attempted annexation of the Dominican Republic   In trade policy  Grant s administration implemented a gold standard and sought to strengthen the dollar  His response to the Panic of 1873 gave some financial relief to New York banking houses  but was ineffective in halting the five year economic depression that produced high unemployment  low prices  low profits  and bankruptcies  Leaving office in 1877  he embarked on a widely praised world tour lasting over two years   In 1880  Grant was unsuccessful in obtaining a Republican nomination for a third term  Facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer  he completed his memoirs   which proved a major critical and financial success  His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring of national unity  Historians  evaluations were negative about his presidency before recovering somewhat beginning in the 1980s  Scholars rank his presidency below the average of other presidents  Grant s critics take a negative view of his economic mismanagement and his failed Dominican Republic annexation treaty  while admirers emphasize his concern for Native Americans and enforcement of civil and voting rights       Hiram Ulysses Grant was born in Point Pleasant  Ohio   on April 27  1822  to Jesse Root Grant  a tanner   and Hannah  ne Simpson  Grant  His ancestors Matthew and Priscilla Grant arrived aboard the Mary and John at Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630    Grant s great grandfather fought in the French and Indian War   and his grandfather served in the American Revolution at Bunker Hill     Grant s father was a Whig Party supporter with abolitionist sentiments    In 1823  the family moved to the village of Georgetown in Brown County  Ohio   where five more siblings were born  Simpson  Clara  Orvil  Jennie  and Mary    Young Grant regularly attended school  While hating the tannery  he chose work on his father s farm    Unlike his siblings  Grant was not forced to attend church by his Methodist parents    a     for the rest of his life  he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination    Observers  including his own son  thought he was an agnostic    In his youth  Grant developed an unusual ability to work with and control horses  As a general he rode the strongest and most challenging horse available  and was sometimes injured in riding     When Grant was 17  Congressman Thomas L  Hamer nominated him to the United States Military Academy at West Point  New York   Hamer mistakenly wrote down the name as  Ulysses S  Grant of Ohio   and this became his adopted name    b     His nickname became  Sam  among army colleagues at the academy since the initials  U S   also stood for   Uncle Sam    As he later recalled it   a military life had no charms for me   he was lax in his studies  but he achieved above average grades in mathematics and geology    Quiet by nature  he established a few intimate friends  including Frederick Tracy Dent and Rufus Ingalls     Grant developed a reputation as a fearless and expert horseman known as a horse whisperer       setting an equestrian high jump record that stood for almost 25 years  He also studied under Romantic artist Robert Walter Weir and produced nine surviving artworks  He graduated in 1843  ranking 21st in a class of 39  Glad to leave the academy  his plan was to resign his commission after his four year term of duty    Despite his excellent horsemanship  he was not assigned to the cavalry  assignments were determined by class rank  not aptitude   but to the 4th Infantry Regiment   He was made regimental quartermaster  managing supplies and equipment  with the rank of brevet second lieutenant      Grant s first assignment after graduation took him to the Jefferson Barracks near St  Louis  Missouri     It was the nation s largest military base in the west  commanded by Colonel Stephen W  Kearny   Grant was happy with his new commander  but looked forward to the end of his military service and a possible teaching career    He spent some of his time in Missouri visiting the family of his West Point classmate  Frederick Tracy Dent  he became engaged to Dent s sister  Julia   in 1844     Amid rising tensions with Mexico  Grant s unit shifted to Louisiana as part of the Army of Observation under Major General Zachary Taylor     When the MexicanAmerican War broke out in 1846  the Army entered Mexico  Although a quartermaster  Grant led a cavalry charge at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma     At Monterrey he demonstrated his equestrian ability  by volunteering to carry a dispatch through sniper lined streets while hanging off the side of his horse  keeping the animal between him and the enemy    President James K  Polk   wary of Taylor s growing popularity  divided his forces  sending some troops  including Grant s unit  to form a new army under Major General Winfield Scott     Scott s army landed at Veracruz and advanced toward Mexico City   The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec outside Mexico City  Grant was a quartermaster in charge of supplies and did not have a combat role  but he yearned for one and finally was allowed to take part in dangerous missions  At Chapultepec  men under Grant s direction dragged a disassembled howitzer into a church steeple  reassembled it  and bombarded nearby Mexican troops  His bravery and initiative earned him brevet promotions  he became a temporary captain while his permanent rank was lieutenant  Scott s army entered the city  and the Mexicans agreed to peace soon afterward     During this war Grant studied the tactics and strategies of Scott and others  often second guessing their moves beforehand    In his Memoirs   he wrote that this is how he learned about military leadership  and in retrospect identified his leadership style with Taylor s  Even so  he believed that the Mexican war was wrongful and that the territorial gains from the war were designed to expand slavery  Grant reflected in 1883   I was bitterly opposed to the measure  and to this day  regard the war  which resulted  as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation   He opined that the Civil War was punishment inflicted on the nation for its aggression in Mexico     Grant s mandatory service expired during the war  but he chose to remain a soldier  Four years after becoming engaged  he married Julia on August 22  1848      They had four children  Frederick   Ulysses Jr    Buck    Ellen   Nellie    and Jesse     Grant s first post war assignments took him and Julia to Detroit and then to Sackets Harbor  New York     In 1852  Grant s next assignment sent him west to Fort Vancouver in the Oregon Territory   Julia  who was eight months pregnant with Ulysses Jr   did not accompany him    While traveling overland through Panama   an outbreak of cholera among his fellow travelers caused 150 fatalities  Grant arranged makeshift transportation and hospital facilities to care for the sick    He debarked in San Francisco during the height of the California Gold Rush      Grant s time in the Pacific Northwest followed the Cayuse War   the army was stationed there to keep peace between settlers and Indians  To supplement a military salary which was inadequate to support his family  Grant tried and failed at several business ventures  confirming Jesse Grant s belief that his son had no head for business    He was unhappy being separated from his family  and rumors circulated that he was drinking to excess    c      Promoted to captain in the summer of 1853  Grant was assigned to command Company F  4th Infantry  at Fort Humboldt in California  The commanding officer at Fort Humboldt  Lieutenant Colonel Robert C  Buchanan   received reports that Grant became intoxicated off duty while seated at the pay officer s table  In lieu of a court martial  Buchanan gave Grant an ultimatum to resign  he did so  effective July 31  1854  without explanation and returned to St  Louis    The War Department stated on his record   Nothing stands against his good name     After Grant s retirement  rumors persisted in the regular army of his drinking    Years later  he said   the vice of intemperance  drunkenness  had not a little to do with my decision to resign      Grant was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows      At age 32  with no civilian vocation  Grant struggled through seven financially lean years  His father initially offered him a place in the Galena  Illinois   branch of the family s tannery and leather goods business  on condition that Julia and the children stay with her parents in Missouri or with the Grants in Kentucky  Ulysses and Julia opposed another separation and declined the offer    In 1855  Grant farmed on his brother in law s property near St  Louis   using slaves owned by Julia s father    The farm was not successful and to earn money he sold firewood on St  Louis street corners    The next year  the Grants moved to land on Julia s father s farm  and built a home Grant called   Hardscrabble      Julia hated the rustic house  which she described as an  unattractive cabin     In 1857  Grant acquired a slave  a thirty five year old man named William Jones  from his father in law    The Panic of 1857 devastated farmers  including Grant  who was forced to rent out Hardscrabble the following year     Having met with no success farming  the Grants left the farm when their fourth and final child was born in 1858  Grant freed his slave in 1859 instead of selling him  at a time when slaves commanded a high price and Grant needed money badly    For the next year  the family took a small house in St  Louis where he worked with Julia s cousin Harry Boggs as a bill collector  again without success    In 1860  Jesse offered him the job in Galena without conditions  and Grant accepted  The leather shop   Grant   Perkins   sold harnesses  saddles  and other leather goods  and purchased hides from farmers in the prosperous Galena area  Grant and family moved to a rental house that year     Grant was not politically active before the Civil War    His father in law was a prominent Missouri Democrat   which hurt Grant s bid to become county engineer in 1859  while his father was an outspoken Republican in Galena    In the 1856 election  Grant cast his first presidential vote for the Democrat  James Buchanan   later saying he was really voting against John C  Frmont   the first Republican candidate  over concern that Frmont s anti slavery position would motivate southern states to secede    In 1860  he favored Democrat Stephen A  Douglas over Abraham Lincoln   and Lincoln over the Southern Democrat  John C  Breckinridge   Lacking the residency requirements in Illinois at the time  he could not vote     On April 12  1861  the American Civil War began as Confederate troops attacked Fort Sumter in Charleston  South Carolina  Two days later  President Lincoln called for 75 000 volunteers and a mass meeting was held in Galena to encourage recruitment  Recognized as a military professional  Grant was asked to lead the ensuing effort  Before the attack on Fort Sumter  Grant had not reacted strongly to Southern secession    The news of the attack came as a shock in Galena  and Grant shared his neighbors  mounting concern about the onset of war    After hearing a speech by his father s attorney  John Aaron Rawlins   Grant found renewed energy in the Union cause    Rawlins later became Grant s aide de camp and close friend during the war  Grant recalled with satisfaction that after that first recruitment meeting in Galena   I never went into our leather store again      Without any formal rank in the army  Grant helped recruit a company of volunteers and accompanied the regiment to Springfield   the state capital    During this time  Grant quickly perceived that the war would be fought for the most part by volunteers and not career soldiers    Governor Richard Yates offered Grant a position recruiting and training volunteer units  which he accepted  but he still wanted a field command in the regular army  He made several efforts through contacts  including Major General George B  McClellan  to acquire such a position  McClellan refused to meet him  remembering Grant s earlier reputation for drinking while stationed in California    Meanwhile  he continued serving at the training camps and made a positive impression on the volunteer Union recruits     With the aid of his advocate in Washington  Illinois congressman Elihu B  Washburne   Grant was formally promoted to Colonel on June 14  1861  and put in charge of disciplining the unruly 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment   To restore discipline  Grant had one troublemaker bound and gagged to a post for being drunk and disorderly    Transferred to northern Missouri  Grant was promoted by Lincoln to Brigadier General  backdated to May 17  1861  again with Washburne s support    Believing Grant was a general of  dogged persistence  and  iron will   Major General John C  Frmont assigned Grant command of troops near Cairo  Illinois by the end of August 1861    Under Frmont s authority Grant advanced into Paducah and took the town without a fight     On November 7  1861 Grant and his troops crossed the Mississippi to attack Confederate soldiers encamped in Belmont   Missouri    They took the camp  but the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier General Gideon J  Pillow forced a retreat to Cairo  A tactical defeat  the battle nonetheless gave Grant and his volunteers confidence and experience    After Belmont  Grant asked his new commander Henry Halleck  Lincoln had relieved Frmont of command  for permission to move against Fort Henry in Tennessee  which would open the Tennessee River to Union gunboats  Halleck agreed on condition that the attack be conducted in coordination with navy Flag Officer Andrew H  Foote     Grant s troops  in close cooperation with Foote s naval forces captured Fort Henry on February 6  1862   Emboldened by Lincoln s call for a general advance of all Union forces  Grant ordered an immediate assault on nearby Fort Donelson  which dominated the Cumberland River  this time without Halleck s permission   On February 15  Grant and Foote met stiff resistance from Confederate forces under Pillow  Reinforced by 10 000 troops  Grant s army totaled 25 000 troops against 12 000 Confederates  Foote s first approach was repulsed  and the Confederates attempted a breakout  pushing Grant s right flank into disorganized retreat    Grant rallied his troops  resumed the offensive  retook the Union right  and attacked Pillow s left  Pillow ordered Confederate troops back into the fort and relinquished command to Brigadier General Simon Bolivar Buckner   who the next day acceded to Grant s demand for his  unconditional and immediate surrender   Lincoln promoted Grant to major general of volunteers while the Northern press treated Grant as a hero  Playing off his initials  they took to calling him  Unconditional Surrender Grant      Encamped on the western bank of the Tennessee River  Grant s Army of the Tennessee   now numbering about 45 000 troops  prepared to attack a Confederate army of roughly equal strength at Corinth  Mississippi   a vital railroad junction    The Confederates  led by Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P G T  Beauregard   struck first on April 6  1862  attacking five divisions of Grant s army bivouacked at Pittsburg Landing    Grant s troops were not entrenched and were taken by surprise  falling back before the Confederate onslaught    At day s end  the Confederates captured one Union division  but Grant s army was able to hold the Landing    The remaining Union army might have been destroyed  but the Confederates halted due to exhaustion  confusion  and a lack of reinforcements    Grant  bolstered by 18 000 fresh troops from the divisions of Major Generals Don Carlos Buell and Lew Wallace   counterattacked at dawn the next day    The Northerners regained the field and forced the rebels to retreat back to Corinth     After the battle the Northern press criticized Grant for high casualties and for his alleged drunkenness during the battle  as a result  Halleck removed Grant from active command of his army    Discouraged and disappointed  Grant considered resigning his commission  but Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman   one of his division commanders  convinced him to stay    The battle was the costliest in American history to that point  with total casualties of about 23 800    Lincoln overruled Grant s critics  saying  I can t spare this man  he fights   and reinstated Grant as field commander of the Army of the Tennessee after his troops took Corinth    On September 19  1862  Grant s army defeated Confederates at the Battle of Iuka   then successfully defended Corinth   inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy    In November 1862  after Lincoln s preliminary Emancipation Proclamation   Grant ordered units under his command  headed by Chaplain John Eaton   to incorporate contraband African American slaves into the Union war effort  giving them clothes  shelter  and wages for their services     Along with his military responsibilities Grant was concerned over an expanding illicit cotton trade in his district    He believed the trade undermined the Union war effort  funded the Confederacy  and prolonged the war  while Union soldiers died in the fields    On December 17  1862  he issued General Order No  11   expelling  Jews  as a class   from the district  saying that Jewish merchants were violating trade regulations    Writing in 2012  historian Jonathan D  Sarna said Grant  issued the most notorious anti Jewish official order in American history     Historians  opinions vary on Grant s motives for issuing the order    Jewish leaders complained to Lincoln while the Northern press criticized Grant    Lincoln demanded the order be revoked and Grant rescinded it within three weeks    Grant made amends with the Jewish community during his presidency     Located on the high bluffs of the Mississippi River  Vicksburg  Mississippi was the last obstacle to Union control of that river  both Lincoln and Grant saw it as the key to victory in the West and were determined to take the rebel stronghold  Grant was aggravated to learn that Lincoln authorized Major General John A  McClernand to raise a separate army for the purpose    Halleck ordered McClernand to Memphis   and placed him under Grant s authority    In December 1862  Grant moved to take Vicksburg by an overland route  with a joint water expedition on the Mississippi led by Sherman  Confederate cavalry raiders stalled Grant s advance by capturing his supply depot at Holly Springs  while the Confederate army led by Lieutenant General John C  Pemberton concentrated and repulsed Sherman s direct approach to Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou     McClernand reached Sherman s army  assumed command  and independently of Grant led a campaign that captured Confederate Fort Hindman     On January 29  1863 Grant assumed personal overall command and then began a series of attempts to move his army through the water logged terrain to bypass Vicksburg s guns  these also proved ineffective  however  Union soldiers became better trained     On April 16  1863  Grant ordered Admiral David Porter  s Union gunboats south under fire from the Vicksburg batteries to meet up with his Union troops who had marched south down the west side of the Mississippi River    Grant ordered diversionary battles  confusing Pemberton and allowing Grant s army to cross east over the Mississippi  landing troops at Bruinsburg     Continuing east  he captured Jackson   the state capital and a railroad supply center  At the Battle of Champion Hill   Pemberton s army was defeated  and forced to retreat into Vicksburg    After Grant s men assaulted the Vicksburg entrenchments twice  suffering severe losses  they settled in for a siege lasting seven weeks   Pemberton surrendered Vicksburg to Grant on July 4  1863     The fall of Vicksburg gave Union forces control over the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy in two  By that time  Grant s political sympathies fully coincided with the Radical Republicans   aggressive prosecution of the war and emancipation of the slaves    Although the success at Vicksburg was a great morale boost for the Union war effort  Grant received criticism for his decisions and his alleged drunkenness    The personal rivalry between McClernand and Grant continued after Vicksburg  until Grant removed McClernand from command when he contravened Grant by publishing an order without permission    When Secretary of War Edwin M  Stanton suggested Grant be brought back east to run the Army of the Potomac   Grant demurred  writing that he knew the geography and resources of the West better and he did not want to upset the chain of command in the East     Lincoln commissioned Grant a major general in the regular army and assigned him command of the newly formed Division of the Mississippi in October 1863  including the Armies of the Ohio   Tennessee  and Cumberland     After the Battle of Chickamauga   the Army of the Cumberland retreated into Chattanooga  where they were trapped    When informed of the situation  Grant put Major General George H  Thomas in charge of the besieged army    Taking command  Grant arrived in Chattanooga by horseback  devising plans to resupply the city and break the siege    Lincoln also sent Major General Joseph Hooker and two divisions of the Army of the Potomac to assist    Union forces captured Brown s Ferry and opened a supply line to Bridgeport    On November 23  1863  Grant organized three armies to attack at Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain     Two days later in the early morning  Hooker s forces successfully took Lookout Mountain    Grant ordered Thomas and the Army of the Cumberland to advance when Sherman s army failed to take Missionary Ridge from the northeast    The Army of the Cumberland  led by Major General Philip Sheridan and Brigadier General Thomas J  Wood   charged uphill and captured the Confederate entrenchments on top of the ridge  forcing the rebels into disorganized retreat    The decisive battle gave the Union control of Tennessee and opened Georgia   the heartland of the Confederacy  to Union invasion     On March 3  1864 Lincoln promoted Grant to Lieutenant General   giving him command of all Union Armies  under direct supervision only to the President    Grant assigned Sherman the Division of the Mississippi and traveled east to Washington D C   meeting with Lincoln to devise a strategy of total war against the Confederacy  After settling Julia into a house in Georgetown  Grant established his headquarters with General George Meade  s Army of the Potomac in Culpeper  Virginia    He devised a strategy of coordinated Union offensives  attacking the rebel armies at the same time to keep the Confederates from shifting reinforcements within their interior lines  Sherman was to pursue Joseph E  Johnston  s Army of the Tennessee   while Meade would lead the Army of the Potomac  with Grant in camp  to attack Robert E  Lee  s Army of Northern Virginia     Major General Benjamin Butler was to advance towards Richmond from the south  up the James River     If Lee was forced south as expected  Grant would join forces with Butler s armies and be fed supplies from the James  Major General Franz Sigel was to capture the railroad line at Lynchburg   move east  and attack from the Blue Ridge Mountains     Grant knew that Lee had limited manpower and that a war of attrition fought on a battlefield without entrenchments would lead to Lee s defeat     Grant was now riding a rising tide of popularity  and there was talk that a Union victory early in the year could lead to his candidacy for the presidency  Grant was aware of the rumors  but had ruled out a political candidacy  the possibility would soon vanish with delays on the battlefield     Sigel s and Butler s efforts sputtered  and Grant was left alone to fight Lee in a series of bloody battles known as the Overland Campaign   Grant crossed the Rapidan River on May 4  1864  and attacked Lee in the Battle of the Wilderness   a hard fought three day battle with many casualties  Rather than retreat as his predecessors had done  Grant flanked Lee s army to the southeast and attempted to wedge his forces between Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House     Lee s army got to Spotsylvania first  and a costly battle ensued  lasting thirteen days  During the battle  Grant attempted to break through Lee s line of defense  resulting in one of the bloodiest assaults of the Civil War  known as the Battle of the Bloody Angle   Unable to break Lee s defenses  Grant again flanked the Confederate army to the southeast  meeting at North Anna   where a battle lasted three days    The Confederates had the defensive advantage  and Grant maneuvered his army to Cold Harbor   a vital railroad hub that linked to Richmond  but Lee s men were again able to entrench against the Union assault  During the third day of the thirteen day battle  Grant led a costly assault on Lee s trenches  As casualty reports became known in the North  heavy criticism fell on Grant  who was castigated as  the Butcher  by the Northern press after taking 52 788 casualties in the thirty days since crossing the Rapidan  Lee s army suffered 32 907 casualties  but he was less able to replace them    The costly Union assault at Cold Harbor was the second of two battles in the war that Grant later said he regretted  the other being his initial assault on the fortifications around Vicksburg   Without being detected by Lee  Grant pulled out of Cold Harbor and moved his army south of the James River  freed Butler from the Bermuda Hundred  where the rebels had surrounded his army   and advanced toward Petersburg  Richmond s central railroad hub     After crossing the James River undetected  Grant and the Army of the Potomac arrived at Petersburg   Confederate General P G T  Beauregard defended the city  and Lee s veteran reinforcements soon arrived  The result was a nine month long siege of Petersburg  stalling the advance  Northern resentment grew as the war dragged on  but an indirect benefit of the Petersburg siege was that Lee was forced to entrench and defend Richmond  and was unable to reinforce the Army of the Tennessee  Sheridan was assigned command of the Union Army of the Shenandoah and Grant directed him to  follow the enemy to their death   Lee had sent General Jubal Early up the Shenandoah Valley to attack the federal capital and draw troops away from the Army of the Potomac  but Sheridan defeated Early  ensuring that Washington would not be endangered  Grant then ordered Sheridan s cavalry to destroy vital Confederate supplies in the Shenandoah Valley  When Sheridan reported suffering attacks by irregular Confederate cavalry under John S  Mosby   Grant recommended rounding up their families for imprisonment as hostages at Fort McHenry     Grant approved of a plan to blow up part of the enemy trenches from an underground tunnel  The explosion created a crater  into which poorly led Union troops poured  Recovering from the surprise  Confederates surrounded the crater and easily picked off Union troops within it  The Union s 3500 casualties outnumbered the Confederates  by three to one  although the plan could have been successful if implemented correctly  Grant admitted the tactic had been a  stupendous failure     On August 9  1864  Grant  who had just arrived at his headquarters in City Point   narrowly escaped death when Confederate spies blew up an ammunition barge in the James River    Rather than fight Lee in a full frontal attack as he had done at Cold Harbor  Grant continued to extend Lee s defenses south and west of Petersburg  to capture vital railroad links    As Grant continued to push the Union advance westward  Lee s lines became overstretched and undermanned  After the Federal army rebuilt the City Point Railroad   Grant was able to use mortars to attack Lee s entrenchments    On September 2  Sherman captured Atlanta while confederate forces retreated  ensuring Lincoln s reelection in November    Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln to send a Union Army to march to Savannah devastating the Confederate heartland     Once Sherman reached the East Coast and Thomas dispatched John Bell Hood  s forces in Tennessee  Union victory appeared certain  and Lincoln attempted negotiations  He enlisted Francis Preston Blair to carry a message to Confederate President Jefferson Davis  Davis and Lincoln each appointed commissioners  but the conference soon stalled  Grant contacted Lincoln  who agreed to personally meet with the commissioners at Fort Monroe   The peace conference that took place near Union controlled Fort Monroe was ultimately fruitless  but represented Grant s first foray into diplomacy     In late March 1865  Grant s forces finally took Petersburg  then captured Richmond that April  Grant  Sherman  Admiral Porter and Lincoln held a conference on the River Queen to discuss Reconstruction of the South    Lee s troops began deserting in large numbers  disease and lack of supplies also diminished the remaining Confederates  Lee attempted to link up with the remnants of Joseph E  Johnston  s defeated army  but Union cavalry forces led by Sheridan were able to stop the two armies from converging  Lee and his army surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9  1865  Grant gave generous terms  Confederate troops surrendered their weapons and were allowed to return to their homes with their mounts  on the condition that they would not take up arms against the United States  On April 26  Johnson s Confederate army surrendered to Sherman under the same terms Grant offered to Lee    On May 26  Kirby Smith s western Confederate army surrendered and the Civil War was over     On April 14  five days after Grant s victory at Appomattox  he attended a cabinet meeting in Washington  Lincoln invited him and his wife to Ford s Theater   but they declined as they had plans to travel to Philadelphia  In a conspiracy that targeted several government leaders  Lincoln was fatally shot by John Wilkes Booth at the theater  and died the next morning    Many  including Grant himself  thought that he had been a target in the plot    Secretary of War Stanton notified him of the President s death and summoned him back to Washington  Attending Lincoln s funeral on April 19  Grant stood alone and wept openly  he later said Lincoln was  the greatest man I have ever known     Regarding the new President  Andrew Johnson   Grant told Julia that he dreaded the change in administrations  he judged Johnson s attitude toward white southerners as one that would  make them unwilling citizens   and initially thought that with President Johnson   Reconstruction has been set back no telling how far      At the war s end  Grant remained commander of the army  with duties that included enforcement of Reconstruction in the former Confederate states and supervision of Indian wars on the western Plains    Grant secured a house for his family in Georgetown Heights in 1865  but instructed Elihu Washburne that for political purposes his legal residence remained in Galena  Illinois    That same year  Grant spoke at Cooper Union in New York  where the New York Times reported that     the entranced and bewildered multitude trembled with extraordinary delight   Further travels that summer took the Grants to Albany  New York   back to Galena  and throughout Illinois and Ohio  with enthusiastic receptions     In November 1865  Johnson sent Grant on a fact finding mission to the South  Afterwards  Grant recommended continuation of a reformed Freedmen s Bureau   which Johnson opposed  but advised against the use of black troops in garrisons  which he believed encouraged an alternative to farm labor    Grant did not believe the people of the devastated South were ready for civilian self rule  and that both whites and blacks in the South required protection by the federal government    He also warned of threats by disaffected poor people  black and white  and recommended that local decision making be entrusted only to  thinking men of the South   i e   men of property     In this respect  Grant s opinion on Reconstruction aligned with Johnson s policy of pardoning established southern leaders and restoring them to their positions of power    He joined Johnson in arguing that Congress should allow representatives from the South to take their seats    On July 25  1866  Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of General of the Army of the United States      Johnson favored a lenient approach to Reconstruction  calling for an immediate return of the former Confederate states into the Union without any guarantee of African American civil rights    The Radical Republican  controlled Congress opposed the idea and refused to admit Congressmen from the former Confederate states    Over Johnson s vetoes  Congress renewed the Freedman s Bureau and passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866   During the congressional election campaign later that year  Johnson took his case to the people in his   Swing Around the Circle   speaking tour    Johnson pressured Grant  by then the most popular man in the country  to go on the tour  Grant  wishing to appear loyal  agreed    Grant believed that Johnson was purposefully agitating conservative opinion to defy Congressional Reconstruction    Finding himself increasingly at odds with Johnson  Grant confided to his wife that he thought the President s speeches were a  national disgrace     Publicly  Grant attempted to appear loyal to Johnson while not alienating Republican legislators essential to his future political career  Concerned that Johnson s differences with Congress would cause renewed insurrection in the South  he ordered Southern arsenals to ship arms north to prevent their capture by Southern state governments     Conflict between radicals and conservatives continued after the 1866 congressional elections  Rejecting Johnson s vision for quick reconciliation with former Confederates  Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts   which divided the southern states into five military districts to protect the freedman s constitutional and congressional rights  Military district governors were to lead transitional state governments in each district  Grant  who was to select the general to govern each district from a group designated by Johnson  preferred Congress s plan for enforcement of Reconstruction    Grant was optimistic that Reconstruction Acts would help pacify the South    By complying with the Acts and instructing his subordinates to do likewise  Grant further alienated Johnson  When Sheridan removed public officials in Louisiana who impeded Reconstruction  Johnson was displeased and sought Sheridan s removal    Grant recommended a rebuke  but not a dismissal    Throughout the Reconstruction period  Grant and the military protected the rights of more than 1 500 African Americans elected to political office and overturned the first black codes in 1867     Johnson wished to replace Stanton  a Lincoln appointee who sympathized with Congressional Reconstruction  To keep Grant under control as a potential political rival  Johnson asked him to take the post  Grant recommended against the move  in light of the Tenure of Office Act   which required Senate approval for cabinet removals  Johnson believed the Act did not apply to officers appointed by the previous president  and forced the issue by making Grant an interim appointee during a Senate recess  Grant agreed to accept the post temporarily  and Stanton vacated the office until the Senate reconvened     When the Senate reinstated Stanton  Johnson told Grant to refuse to surrender the office and let the courts resolve the matter  Grant told Johnson in private that violating the Tenure of Office Act was a federal offense  which could result in a fine or imprisonment  Believing he had no other legal alternatives  Grant returned the office to Stanton  This incurred Johnson s wrath  at a cabinet meeting immediately afterwards  Johnson accused Grant of breaking his promise to remain Secretary of War  Grant disputed that he had ever made such a promise although cabinet members later testified he had done so    Newspapers friendly to Johnson published a series of articles to discredit Grant over returning the War Department to Stanton  stating that Grant had been deceptive in the matter    This public insult infuriated Grant  and he defended himself in an angry letter to Johnson  after which the two men were confirmed foes  When Grant s statement became public  it increased his popularity among Radical Republicans and he emerged from the controversy unscathed    Although Grant favored Johnson s impeachment  he took no active role in the impeachment proceedings against Johnson   which were fueled in part by Johnson s removal of Stanton  Johnson barely survived  and none of the other Republican leaders directly involved benefited politically in their unsuccessful attempt to remove the president     While remaining Commanding General  Grant entered the 1868 campaign season with increased popularity among the Radical Republicans following his abandonment of Johnson over the Secretary of War dispute  The Republicans chose Grant as their presidential candidate on the first ballot at the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago  In his letter of acceptance to the party  Grant concluded with  Let us have peace   which became his campaign slogan    For vice president  the delegates nominated House Speaker Schuyler Colfax   Grant s 1862 General Order No  11 became an issue during the presidential campaign   he sought to distance himself from the order  saying  I have no prejudice against sect or race  but want each individual to be judged by his own merit     As President  Grant would atone for 1862 s expulsion of the Jews   Historian Jonathan Sarna argues that Grant became one of the greatest friends of Jews in American history  meeting with them often and appointing them to high office  He was the first president to condemn atrocities against Jews in Europe  thus putting human rights on the American diplomatic agenda    As was expected at the time  Grant returned to his home state   d   and left the active campaigning and speaking on his behalf to his campaign manager William E  Chandler and others    The Republican campaign focused on continuing Reconstruction and restoring the public credit     The Democrats nominated former New York Governor Horatio Seymour   Their campaign focused mainly on ending Reconstruction and returning control of the South to the white planter class  which alienated many War Democrats in the North    The Democrats attacked Reconstruction and the Republican Party s support of African American rights  while deriding Grant  calling him captain of the  Black Marines     Grant won the election by 300 000 votes out of 5 716 082 votes cast  receiving an electoral college landslide  of 214 votes to Seymour s 80  Grant  at the age of 46 was  at the time  the youngest president ever elected  His election was a triumph of conservative principles that included sound money  efficient government  and the restoration of Southern reconstructed states    Grant was the first president elected after the nation had outlawed slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves  Implementation of these new rights was slow to come  in the 1868 election  the black vote counted in only 16 of the 37 states  nearly all in the South    Grant lost Louisiana and Georgia primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African American voters    During the election there was a noticeably large number of black citizens in Washington     On March 4  1869  Grant was sworn in as the eighteenth President of the United States by Chief Justice Salmon P  Chase   His presidency began with a break from tradition  as Johnson did not attend Grant s inauguration at the Capitol or ride with him as he departed the White House for the last time    In his inaugural address  Grant urged the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment and said he would approach Reconstruction  calmly  without prejudice  hate or sectional pride     Grant recommended the  proper treatment  of Native Americans be studied  advocating their civilization and eventual citizenship    Grant took an unconventional approach to choosing his cabinet  declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation    In his effort to create national harmony  Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders    Grant appointed his wartime comrade John A  Rawlins as Secretary of War and Hamilton Fish   a conservative New York statesman  as Secretary of State  Sherman earned promotion to Commanding General   but his relationship with Grant became strained when the President took Rawlins s side when the Secretary of War sought to limit Sherman s authority  Rawlins died in office a few months later  and Grant appointed William W  Belknap as his replacement     Grant selected several non politicians to his cabinet  including Adolph E  Borie and Alexander Turney Stewart   with limited success  Borie served briefly as Secretary of the Navy  later replaced by George M  Robeson   while Stewart was prevented from becoming Secretary of the Treasury by a 1789 statute that barred businessmen from the position  Senators Charles Sumner and Roscoe Conkling opposed amending the law     In place of Stewart  Grant appointed Massachusetts Representative George S  Boutwell   a radical  as Treasury Secretary  Grant s other cabinet appointments Jacob D  Cox  Interior   John Creswell  Postmaster General   and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar  Attorney General were well received and uncontroversial    Grant also appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court   William Strong   Joseph P  Bradley   Ward Hunt and Chief Justice Morrison Waite     Hunt voted to uphold Reconstruction laws while Waite did much to undermine them     Reconstruction of the South continued as Grant took office in March 1869  Grant  unlike his predecessor  advocated systematic federal enforcement of fundamental civil rights regardless of race    He lobbied Congress to pass the Fifteenth Amendment  guaranteeing that no state could prevent someone from voting based on race  and believed that its passage would secure freedmen s rights  Grant asked Congress to admit representatives from the remaining unrepresented Southern states in conformity with Congressional Reconstruction  they did so  passing legislation providing that Mississippi  Virginia  and Texas would be represented in Congress after they ratified the Fifteenth Amendment    Grant pressured Congress to draw up legislation that would seat African American state legislators in Georgia  who had been ousted by white conservatives    Congress responded through special legislation  the members were re seated in the Georgia legislature  and Georgia was required to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment to gain representation in Congress    By July 1870  the four remaining states were readmitted     To enforce the new amendment  Grant relied on the army  as well as the Justice Department   created in 1870 to enforce federal laws in the South  Where the attorney general had once been only a legal adviser to the president  he now led a cabinet department dedicated to enforcing federal law  including a solicitor general to argue on the government s behalf in court    Under Grant s first attorney general  Ebenezer R  Hoar   the administration was not especially aggressive in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors  but Hoar s successor  Amos T  Akerman   was more zealous  Alarmed by a rise in terror by the Ku Klux Klan and other groups against African Americans   Congress  with Grant s encouragement  passed a series of three laws  the Enforcement Acts from 1870 to 1871  which made depriving African Americans their civil rights a federal offense and authorized the president to use the military to enforce the laws    In May 1871  Grant ordered federal troops to help marshals in arresting Klansmen  That October  on Akerman s recommendation  Grant suspended habeas corpus in part of South Carolina and sent federal troops to enforce the law there  After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement  George Henry Williams   the Klan s power collapsed  by 1872  elections in the South saw African Americans voting in record numbers    That same year  Grant signed the Amnesty Act   which restored political rights to former Confederates  Lacking sufficient funding  the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of the Klan in June 1873  and Grant offered the Klan clemency in exchange for peace     After the Klan s decline  other conservative whites formed armed groups  such as the Red Shirts and the White League who openly used violence and intimidation to take control of state governments    The Panic of 1873 and the ensuing depression contributed to public fatigue  and the North grew less concerned with Reconstruction    Supreme Court rulings in the Slaughter House Cases  1873  and United States v  Cruikshank  1875  restricted federal enforcement of civil rights    Grant began to favor limiting the use of troops  to avoid the impression that he was acting as a military dictator  he was also concerned that increased military pressure in the South might cause conservative whites in the North to bolt the Republican Party  In 1874  Grant by proclamation ended the BrooksBaxter War bringing Reconstruction in Arkansas to a peaceful conclusion  but that same year  he sent troops and warships under Major General William H  Emory to New Orleans in the wake of the Colfax Massacre and disputes over the election of Governor William Pitt Kellogg     Emory peacefully restored Kellogg to office and the following year the parties reached a compromise allowing Democrats to retain control of the Louisiana House    Under public pressure Grant recalled General Sheridan and most of the federal troops from Louisiana     By 1875  Democratic   Redeemer   politicians took control of all but three Southern states  As violence against black Southerners escalated once more  Edwards Pierrepont  Grant s fourth attorney general  told Governor Adelbert Ames of Mississippi that the people were  tired of the autumnal outbreaks in the South   and declined to intervene directly  instead  sending an emissary to negotiate a peaceful election    Grant signed an ambitious Civil Rights Act of 1875   which expanded federal law enforcement by prohibiting discrimination on account of race in public lodging   public transportation   and jury service     However  it did not stop the rise of white supremacist forces in the South    In October 1876  Grant sent troops to South Carolina to aid Republican Governor Daniel Chamberlain     Even so  the remaining three Republican governments in the South fell to Redeemers after the 1876 presidential election   and the ensuing Compromise of 1877 marked the end of Reconstruction      e    Grant s attempts to live peacefully with Native Americans marked a radical reversal of what had since the 1830s been the government s policy of Indian removal   He appointed Ely S  Parker   a Seneca Indian and member of his wartime staff  as Commissioner of Indian Affairs    My efforts in the future will be directed   Grant said in his second inaugural address   by a humane course  to bring the aborigines of the country under the benign influences of education and civilization    Wars of extermination    are demoralizing and wicked   Grant s  Peace Policy  aimed to replace entrepreneurs serving as Indian agents with missionaries    In 1869  Grant signed a law establishing a Board of Indian Commissioners to oversee spending and reduce corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs    Two years later  he signed a bill ending the Indian treaty system  the law now treated individual Native Americans as wards of the federal government  and no longer dealt with the tribes as sovereign entities    Grant wished for Indian tribes to be protected on reservations and educated in European style farming and culture  abandoning their hunter gatherer way of life    Although  as biographer Jean Edward Smith wrote  Grant s peace policy was  remarkably progressive and humanitarian  for its time  it ultimately disregarded native cultures  something modern Americans see  as a grave error      The peace policy showed some success in reducing battles between Indians and whites on the western frontier  but the increased slaughter of the buffalo  encouraged by Grant s subordinates  led to conflict with the Plains Indians     The Sioux and other Plains tribes accepted the reservation system  but encroachments by whites in search of gold in the Black Hills led to renewed war by the end of Grant s second term  ending the understanding that had developed between Grant and Sioux Chief Red Cloud     Under Major Generals Oliver Otis Howard and George Crook   Grant s policy had greater success in the Southwest  Howard  the former head of the Freedmen s Bureau  negotiated peace with the Apache in 1872  convincing their leader  Cochise   to move the tribe to a new reservation  and ending a war started the year before  In Oregon  relations were less peaceful  as war with the Modocs erupted in April 1873  The Modocs refused to move to a reservation and killed the local army commander  Major General Edward Canby   Although Grant was upset over Canby s death  he ordered restraint  disregarding Sherman s advice to seek revenge or exterminate the tribe  The army captured  tried  and executed the four Modoc warriors responsible for Canby s murder in October 1873  Grant ordered the rest of the Modoc tribe relocated to the Indian Territory      During the Great Sioux War   fueled by the discovery of gold in the Black Hills  Grant came into conflict with Colonel George Armstrong Custer after Custer testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department  Grant ordered Custer arrested for breach of military protocol and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux  Grant later relented and let Custer fight under Brigadier General Alfred Terry     Sioux warriors led by Crazy Horse killed Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn   the army s most famous defeat in the Indian wars  Two months later  Grant castigated Custer in the press  saying  I regard Custer s massacre as a sacrifice of troops  brought on by Custer himself  that was wholly unnecessary  wholly unnecessary     Custer s death shocked the nation  leading Congress to appropriate funds for more troops  two more Western forts and barred Indians from purchasing weapons     Even before Grant became president  expansionists in American politics desired control over the Caribbean islands   Andrew Johnson had recommended annexation but the early anti imperialist Republicans in Congress rejected the plan    Grant renewed negotiations to annex the Dominican Republic   led by Orville E  Babcock   a wartime confidant    Grant was initially skeptical  but at the urging of Admiral Porter  who wanted a naval base at Saman Bay   and Joseph W  Fabens  a New England businessman employed by the Dominican government  Grant became convinced of the plan s merit    He sent Babcock to consult with Buenaventura Bez   who was then the Dominican president and supported annexation  Babcock returned with a draft treaty for annexation in December 1869     Grant believed in peaceful expansion of the nation s borders  and thought acquisition of the island nation   whose demographic featured a black majority   would allow new economic opportunities for African Americans in the United States while increasing American naval power in the Caribbean    Secretary of State Hamilton Fish dismissed the idea  seeing the island as politically unstable and troublesome    Grant personally lobbied Senators to pass the treaty  going so far as to visit Sumner at his home    Fish added to the effort out of loyalty to the administration  but to no avail  the Senate refused to pass the treaty  Sumner s role in leading opposition toward annexation led to political enmity between him and Grant    After the Dominican initiative failed  Grant convinced Fish to stay in the cabinet and gave him greater authority to run the State Department    Unwilling to admit defeat  Grant successfully lobbied Congress to send a commission to the West Indies to investigate  including Frederick Douglass     Although Douglass and the commission approved of Grant s claims for annexation in its findings released on April 5  1871  the Senate remained opposed while Grant was forced to abandon further annexation attempts     Grant and Fish were more successful in their resolution of the Alabama claims   This dispute between the United Kingdom and the United States stemmed from the damage done to American shipping during the Civil War by the five ships built for the Confederacy in British shipyards including  most famously  the CSS Alabama     The Americans claimed that Britain had violated neutrality by building ships for the Confederate Navy    When the war ended  the United States demanded restitution  which the British refused to pay  Negotiations continued fitfully  a sticking point being the claims of  indirect damages  on top of the harm directly caused by the five ships    Sumner opposed the Johnson administration s proposed settlement  which had been rejected by the Senate  believing that Britain should directly pay  2 billion in gold or  alternatively  cede Canada to the United States    Fish convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were more important than acquisition of more territory  and the two nations agreed to negotiate along those lines    A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts  the British admitted regret  but not fault    f   The Senate approved the Treaty of Washington   which also settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries  by a 5012 vote in 1871     In 1873  a Spanish cruiser took captive a merchant ship  Virginius   flying the U S  flag  carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection   The passengers and crew  including eight American citizens  were illegally traveling to Cuba to help overthrow the government  Spanish authorities executed the prisoners  and many Americans called for war with Spain  Fish  with Grant s support  worked to reach a peaceful resolution  Spain s President  Emilio Castelar y Ripoll   expressed regret for the tragedy and agreed to decide reparations through arbitration  Spain surrendered the Virginius and paid a cash indemnity of  80 000 to the families of the executed Americans    In June 1874  Grant s Secretary of the Navy  George M  Robeson  commissioned the reconstruction of five redesigned double turreted monitor warships to compete with the superior Spanish Navy    The administration s diplomacy was also at work in the Pacific as  in December 1874  Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii  David Kalakaua   who was seeking duty free sugar importation to the United States    Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii   incorporating the Pacific islands  sugar industry into the United States  economic sphere     Soon after taking office  Grant took steps to return the nation s currency to a more secure footing  During the Civil War  Congress had authorized the Treasury to issue banknotes that  unlike the rest of the currency  were not backed by gold or silver  The   greenback   notes  as they were known  were necessary to pay the unprecedented war debts  but they also caused inflation and forced gold backed money out of circulation  Grant determined to return the national economy to pre war monetary standards    Many in Congress agreed  and they passed the Public Credit Act of 1869   which guaranteed that bondholders would be repaid in gold  not greenbacks    To strengthen the dollar  Treasury Secretary George S  Boutwell  backed by Grant  sold gold from the Treasury each month and bought back high interest Treasury bonds issued during the war  this had the effect of reducing the deficit  but deflating the currency     These actions had a large impact on the nation s small gold market    Abel Corbin   Grant s brother in law  used his connection with the president to gain inside information for himself and his associates  Jay Gould   a Wall Street trader and railroad magnate  and Jim Fisk  the collaborators were later known as the  Gold Ring      Corbin convinced Grant to appoint a Gould associate as assistant Treasurer  where he could gather information for the Ring    Meanwhile  Gould and Fisk quietly stockpiled gold  Gould convinced Corbin that a high gold price would be good for the nation s prosperity  and Corbin passed this theory on to Grant  who appeared to be convinced  After consulting with Alexander Stewart  his erstwhile nominee for Treasury Secretary  in early September  Grant stopped the sale of gold  believing a higher gold price would help Western farmers    By mid September  however  Grant became suspicious of Corbin  The gold price continued to rise as the conspirators bought ever more  and the rising price affected the wider economy    Grant  seeing that the increase was unnatural  told Boutwell to sell gold  thereby reducing its price    Boutwell did so the next day  on September 22  1869  later known as Black Friday   The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould s scheme as the gold price plummeted  relieving the growing economic tension    Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves    Many brokerage firms collapsed while trade volume and agriculture prices plummeted  causing a mild recession  but by January 1870  the economy resumed its post war recovery     Despite his administration s many scandals  Grant continued to be personally popular    A growing number of reformers  however  were disappointed by Grant s support of Reconstruction  the Gold Ring  and corruption in the New York Customs House     The Crdit Mobilier scandal   in which a railroad company bribed many members of Congress in 1868  did not involve Grant  but did ensnare Vice President Colfax and added to the general sense of dishonesty in Washington    To placate reformers  Grant created a Civil Service Commission authorized by Congress in 1871    The Commission  chaired by reformer George William Curtis   proposed certain reform rules and regulations  which Grant implemented by executive order in April 1872    Congress refused to fund the Civil Service Commission in 1875 or pass legislation to implement its recommendations    There was further division within the party between the faction most concerned with the plight of the freedmen and that concerned with the growth of industry    During the war  both factions  interests had aligned  and in 1868 both had supported Grant  As the wartime coalition began to fray  Grant s alignment with the party s pro Reconstruction elements alienated party leaders who favored an end to federal intervention in Southern racial issues     Many of that faction split from the party in 1872  calling themselves the Liberal Republican Party   Led by Charles Francis Adams of Massachusetts and Senator Carl Schurz of Missouri  they publicly denounced the political patronage system that Sumner called   Grantism   and demanded amnesty for Confederate soldiers  The Liberal Republicans nominated Horace Greeley   another Republican who had come to dislike Grant and his policies    The rest of the Republican Party nominated Grant for reelection  with Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts replacing Colfax as vice presidential nominee    The Democrats  seeking to benefit from anti Grant sentiment  nominated Greeley as well    To the Liberals  chagrin  Greeley made Grant s Southern policy  rather than reform  the main campaign issue    The fusion effort failed and Grant was easily reelected  The Liberal Republicans were unable to deliver many votes  and Greeley was only successful in areas the Democrats would have carried without him    A strong economy  debt reduction  lowered tariffs  repeal of the income tax  and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat the Liberal Republicans    Grant won 56 percent of the popular vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66      g   A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant  while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful     As his first term was ending  Grant continued to work for a strong dollar  signing into law the Coinage Act of 1873   which effectively ended the legal basis for bimetallism  the use of both silver and gold as money   and established the gold standard in practice    The Coinage Act discontinued the standard silver dollar and established the gold dollar as the sole monetary standard  Critics who wanted more money in circulation to facilitate easier credit later denounced the move as the  Crime of 1873   claiming the law caused deflation and helped bankers while hurting farmers     Grant s second term saw renewed economic turmoil  In September 1873  Jay Cooke   Company   a New York brokerage house  collapsed after it failed to sell all of the bonds issued by Cooke s Northern Pacific Railway     The collapse sent ripples through Wall Street  and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined    On September 20  the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days    Grant  who knew little about finance  traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for advice on how to resolve the crisis  which became known as the Panic of 1873     Grant believed that  as with the collapse of the Gold Ring in 1869  the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers    He responded cautiously  instructing the treasury to buy  10 million in government bonds  thus injecting cash into the system  These purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street  but a five year industrial depression  later called the Long Depression   nonetheless swept the nation    Many of the nation s railroads89 out of 364went bankrupt     Congress hoped inflation would stimulate the economy and passed what became known as the Inflation Bill in 1874  Many farmers and workingmen favored the bill  which would have added  64 million in greenbacks to circulation  but some Eastern bankers opposed it because it would have weakened the dollar    Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill  saying that it would destroy the credit of the nation    Grant s veto  supported by Fish  placed him securely in the conservative faction of the Republican party  and was the beginning of the party s commitment to a strong gold backed dollar    Grant later pressured Congress for a bill to further strengthen the dollar by gradually reducing the number of greenbacks in circulation  After losing the House to the Democrats in the 1874 elections   the lame duck Republican Congress did so  On January 14  1875  Grant signed the Specie Payment Resumption Act into law    The Resumption Act required gradual reduction of the amount of greenbacks allowed to circulate and declared that specie payment  i e   in gold or silver  would resume in 1879     Grant served as president during the Gilded Age   a time when the economy was open to speculation and western expansion that fueled corruption in government offices    Against the harsh public revelation of the Credit Mobilier of America scandal   Grant faced charges of misconduct in nearly all federal departments  engaging his administration in constant conflict between corrupt associates and reformers    Although personally honest with his own money matters  Grant had difficulty in spotting corruption in others    He was protective of associates  whose prosecutions he saw as unjust and shielded associates from attack at the cost of his own reputation  unless evidence of personal misconduct was overwhelming    No person linked any of the scandals together  except possibly Grant s personal secretary  Orville E  Babcock  who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed investigations       In Grant s second term  a congressional investigation exposed corruption in the Treasury Department  in a case that would become known as the Sanborn incident   Secretary William Richardson had hired John Sanborn  a friend of Congressman Benjamin Butler  as an independent tax collector on a percentage basis  also known as a moiety     Treasury officials were then privately instructed not to press for payment  so that accounts would eventually become delinquent in taxes and Sanborn would get paid more when he  discovered  the accounts  delinquency    The congressional committee report condemned Richardson for permitting the aggressive tax collection system Sanborn used  but did not attempt impeachment    To quell the public outcry and prevent future fraud  Congress passed the Anti Moiety Act   Signed into law by Grant in 1874  it abolished the moiety system     In 1874  on becoming Treasury Secretary  Benjamin H  Bristow began a series of reforms      Finding that millions of dollars in revenue were missing    and having gotten Grant s endorsement in advance   Let no guilty man escape    Bristow obtained 238 indictments  These led to 110 convictions  and millions in tax dollars were restored to the Treasury    When Bristow s investigation implicated Babcock as part of the Whiskey Ring  Grant became defensive  believing Babcock was the innocent victim of a witch hunt    While denying immunity to minor Whiskey Ring conspirators  Grant worked to protect Babcock    In 1876  Babcock was found not guilty at a trial in which Grant testified on his behalf through a deposition    After the trial  under public pressure  Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House      h   Grant later pardoned several Ring members     As the scandals increased  Congress  with the House now under Democratic control  began several investigations into corruption in the administration  the most notable of which dealt with profiteering at western trading posts     involving Secretary of War William W  Belknap   which led to his resignation    Congress also investigated and reprimanded Navy Secretary George M  Robeson in 1876 for receiving bribes     Grant s Civil Service Commission reforms had limited success  as his cabinet implemented a merit system that increased the number of qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage    Interior Secretary Columbus Delano   however  exempted his department from competitive examinations  and Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform    Zachariah Chandler   who succeeded Delano  cleaned up corruption in the Interior Department    Grant appointed reformers Edwards Pierrepont and Marshall Jewell as Attorney General and Postmaster General  respectively  who supported Bristow s investigations    In 1875  Pierrepont cleaned up corruption among the United States Attorneys and Marshals in the South    Grant suggested other reforms as well  including a proposal that states should offer free public schooling to all children  he also endorsed the Blaine Amendment   which would have forbidden government aid to schools with religious affiliations     Even as Grant drew cheers at the Centennial Exposition in 1876  the collected scandals of the last eight years  the country s weak economy  and the Democratic gains in the House led many in the Republican party to repudiate him    Bristow was among the leading candidates to replace him  suggesting that a large faction desired an end to  Grantism  and feared that Grant would run for a third term    Ultimately  Grant did not run  but Bristow was not the nominee either  as the convention settled on Governor Rutherford B  Hayes of Ohio  a reformer  The Democrats nominated Governor Samuel J  Tilden of New York  Voting irregularities in three Southern states caused the election that year to remain undecided for several months    Grant told Congress to settle the matter through legislation and assured both sides that he would not use the army to force a result  except to curb violence    Congress formed an Electoral Commission to decide the matter  The result was the Compromise of 1877   the Electoral Commission ruled that the disputed votes belonged to Hayes  but the last troops were withdrawn from Southern capitals    The Republicans had won  but Reconstruction was over     After leaving the White House  Grant and his family stayed with friends for two months  before setting out on a world tour    The trip  which would last two years  began in Liverpool in May 1877  where enormous crowds greeted the ex president and his entourage    The Grants dined with Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle   and Grant gave several speeches in London    After a tour on the continent  the Grants spent a few months with their daughter Nellie  who had married an Englishman and moved to that country several years before  Grant and his wife journeyed to France and Italy  spending Christmas 1877 aboard USS Vandalia   a warship docked in Palermo    A winter sojourn in the Holy Land followed  and they visited Greece before returning to Italy and a meeting with Pope Leo XIII     They toured Spain before moving on to Germany  where Grant discussed military matters with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck   telling him that in the final stages of the Civil War  the Union Army fought to preserve the nation and to  destroy slavery      The Grants left from England by ship  sailing through the Suez Canal to India  They visited cities throughout the Raj   welcomed by colonial officials    After India  they toured Burma   Siam  where Grant met with King Chulalongkorn    Singapore   and Cochinchina  Vietnam     Traveling on to Hong Kong  Grant began to change his mind on the nature of colonization  believing that British rule was not  purely selfish  but also good for the colonial subjects    Leaving Hong Kong  the Grants visited the cities of Canton  Shanghai  and Peking  China  He declined to ask for an interview with the Guangxu Emperor   a child of seven  but did speak with the head of government  Prince Gong   and Li Hongzhang   a leading general    They discussed China s dispute with Japan over the Ryukyu Islands   and Grant agreed to help bring the two sides to agreement    After crossing over to Japan and meeting the Emperor Meiji   Grant convinced China to accept the Japanese annexation of the islands  and the two nations avoided war     By then  the Grants had been gone two years  and were homesick  They crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 1879  greeted by cheering crowds    After a visit to Yosemite Valley   they returned at last to Philadelphia on December 16  1879    The voyage around the world had captured popular imagination  and Republicansespecially those of the Stalwart faction excluded from the Hayes administrationsaw Grant in a new light    The Republican nomination for 1880 was wide open after Hayes forswore a second term and many Republicans thought that Grant was the man for the job     Stalwarts  led by Grant s old political ally  Roscoe Conkling   saw the ex president s renewed popularity as a way for their faction to regain power  Opponents denounced the idea as a violation of the two term rule that had been the norm since George Washington  Grant said nothing publicly  but he wanted the job and encouraged his men    Elihu B  Washburne urged him to run  Grant demurred  saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate  though he preferred James G  Blaine to John Sherman     Even so  Conkling and John A  Logan began to organize delegates in Grant s favor  When the convention convened in Chicago in June  there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate  but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination     At the convention  Conkling nominated Grant with an elegant speech  the most famous line being   When asked which state he hails from  our sole reply shall be  he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree     With 370 votes needed for nomination  the first ballot had Grant at 304  Blaine at 284  Sherman at 93  and the rest scattered to minor candidates    Subsequent ballots followed  with roughly the same result  neither Grant nor Blaine could win  After thirty six ballots  Blaine s delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate  Representative James A  Garfield of Ohio    The 306 votes Grant received on the last ballot was not enough to secure the nomination  A procedural motion made the vote unanimous for Garfield  who accepted the nomination     Grant gave speeches for Garfield  but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee  Winfield Scott Hancock   a general who had served under him in the Army of the Potomac    Garfield won the popular vote by a narrow margin  but solidly won the Electoral College214 to 155  After the election  Grant gave Garfield his public support  and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration     Grant s world tour had been costly  When he returned to America  Grant had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home    Wealthy friends bought him a home on Manhattan s Upper East Side   and to make an income  Grant  Jay Gould  and former Mexican Finance Secretary Matas Romero chartered the Mexican Southern Railroad  with plans to build a railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City    Grant urged Chester A  Arthur   who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881  to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico  Arthur and the Mexican government agreed  but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883    The railroad was similarly unsuccessful  falling into bankruptcy the following year     At the same time  Grant s son Ulysses Jr  had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with Ferdinand Ward   Regarded as a rising star  Ward  and the firm  Grant   Ward  were initially successful    In 1883  Grant joined the firm and invested  100 000 of his own money    Investors bought securities through the firm  and Ward used the securities as collateral to borrow money to buy more securities  Grant   Ward pledged that collateral to borrow more money to trade in securities on the firm s own account  The practicecalled hypothecation was legal and accepted  what was illegal was rehypothecation   the practice of pledging the same securities as collateral for multiple loans    Ward  having colluded with the bank involved  did this for many of the firm s assets  When the trades went bad  multiple loans came due  all backed up by the same collateral  Historians agree that Grant was likely unaware of Ward s tactics  but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew  In May 1884  enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt  Ward told Grant of the impending failure  but suggested that this was a temporary shortfall    Grant approached businessman William Henry Vanderbilt   who gave him a personal loan of  150 000    Grant invested the money in the firm  but it was not enough to save the firm from failure  Essentially penniless  but compelled by a sense of personal honor  he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets    Although the proceeds did not cover the loan  Vanderbilt insisted the debt had been paid in full  Grant was left destitute     To restore his family s income  Grant wrote several articles on his Civil War campaigns for The Century Magazine at  500 each  The articles were well received by critics  and the editor  Robert Underwood Johnson   suggested that Grant write a book of memoirs  as Sherman and others had done  Grant s articles would serve as the basis for several chapters     In the summer of 1884  Grant complained of a soreness in his throat  but put off seeing a doctor until late October where he finally learned it was throat cancer     Before being diagnosed  Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in Ocean Grove  New Jersey   on August 4  1884  receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others  it would be his last public appearance    In March of the following year  the New York Times finally announced that Grant was dying of cancer   and a nationwide public concern for the former president began      i   Later  Grant  who had forfeited his military pension when he assumed the presidency  was honored by his friends and the Congress when he was restored to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay     Despite his debilitating illness  Grant worked diligently on his memoirs at his home in New York City  and then from a cottage on the slopes of Mount McGregor   finishing only days before he died    Grant asked his former staff officer  Adam Badeau   to help edit his work  Grant s son Fred assisted with references and proofreading  Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty  but Grant accepted a better offer from his friend  Mark Twain   who proposed a 75 percent royalty    His memoir ends with the Civil War  and does not cover the post war years  including his presidency     The book  Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S  Grant   was a critical and commercial success  In the end  Julia Grant received about  450 000 in royalties    The memoir has been highly regarded by the public  military historians  and literary critics    Grant portrayed himself in the persona of the honorable Western hero  whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness  He candidly depicted his battles against both the Confederates and internal army foes    Twain called the Memoirs a  literary masterpiece   Given over a century of favorable literary analysis  reviewer Mark Perry states that the Memoirs are  the most significant work  of American non fiction      In the days preceding his death  Grant s wife  Julia  all of his children  and three grandchildren were present  After a year long struggle with the cancer  Grant died at 8 o clock in the morning in the Mount McGregor cottage on July 23  1885  at the age of 63    Sheridan  then Commanding General of the Army  ordered a day long tribute to Grant on all military posts  and President Grover Cleveland ordered a thirty day nationwide period of mourning  After private services  the honor guard placed Grant s body on a special funeral train   which traveled to West Point and New York City   A quarter of a million people viewed it in the two days before the funeral    Tens of thousands of men  many of them veterans from the Grand Army of the Republic  GAR  or other veterans  organizations  marched with Grant s casket drawn by two dozen horses to Riverside Park in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan   New York City    His pallbearers included Union generals Sherman and Sheridan  Confederate generals Simon Bolivar Buckner and Joseph E  Johnston  Admiral David Dixon Porter  and Senator John A  Logan  the head of the GAR     Grant s body was laid to rest in Riverside Park  first in a temporary tomb  and thentwelve years later  on April 17  1897in the General Grant National Memorial   also known as  Grant s Tomb   The tomb is the largest mausoleum in North America  Attendance at the New York funeral topped 1 5 million    Ceremonies were held in other major cities around the country  and those who eulogized Grant in the press likened him to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln     No presidential reputations have changed as dramatically as Grant s    Hailed across the North as the winning general in a great war  his nomination as president seemed inevitable  Grant s popularity declined with congressional investigations into corruption in his administration and Custer s defeat at the Battle of the Little Big Horn  In 1877  there was bipartisan approval of Grant s peaceful handling of the electoral crisis    Grant s reputation soared during his well publicized world tour     At his death  Grant was seen as  a symbol of the American national identity and memory   when millions turned out for his funeral procession in 1885 and attended the 1897 dedication of his tomb    Grant s popularity increased in the years immediately after his death  At the same time  commentators and scholars portrayed his administration as the most corrupt in American history  As the popularity of the pro Confederate Lost Cause movement increased early in the 20th century  a more negative view became increasingly common    As they had early in the Civil War  Grant s new critics charged that he was a reckless drunk  and in light of his presidency  that he was also corrupt  In the 1930s  biographer William B  Hesseltine noted that Grant s reputation deteriorated because his enemies were better writers than his friends    In 1931  Frederic Paxson and Christian Bach in the Dictionary of American Biography praised Grant s military vision and his execution of that vision in defeating the Confederacy  but of his political career  the authors were less complimentary  Speaking specifically of the scandals  they wrote that  personal scandal has not touched Grant in any plausible form  but it struck so close to him and so frequently as to necessitate the vindication of his honor by admitting his bad taste in the choice of associates      Views of Grant reached new lows as he was seen as an unsuccessful president and an unskilled  if lucky  general    Bruce Catton and T  Harry Williams began the reassessment of Grant s military career in the 1960s  shifting the analysis of Grant as victor by brute force to that of successful and skillful strategist and commander    Even for scholars with a particular concern for the plight of former slaves and Indians  Grant left a problematic legacy and  with changing attitudes toward warfare after the end of the Vietnam War   Grant s military reputation suffered again    William S  McFeely won the Pulitzer Prize for his critical 1981 biography that emphasized the failure of Grant s presidency to carry out lasting progress and concluded that  he did not rise above limited talents or inspire others to do so in ways that make his administration a credit to American politics     John Y  Simon in 1982 responded to McFeely   Grant s failure as President    lies in the failure of the Indian peace policy and the collapse of Reconstruction    But if Grant tried and failed  who could have succeeded     Simon praised Grant s first term in office  arguing that it should be  remembered for his staunch enforcement of the rights of freedmen combined with conciliation of former Confederates  for reform in Indian policy and civil service  for successful negotiation of the Alabama Claims  and for delivery of peace and prosperity     According to Simon  the Liberal Republican revolt  the Panic of 1873  and the North s conservative retreat from Reconstruction weakened Grant s second term in office  although his foreign policy remained steady     Historians  views have grown more favorable since the 1990s  appreciating Grant s protection of African Americans and his peace policy towards Indians  even where those policies failed    Grant s reputation rose further with Jean Edward Smith s 2001 biography  Smith argued that the same qualities that made Grant a success as a general carried over to his political life to make him  if not a successful president  then certainly an admirable one    Smith wrote that  the common thread is strength of characteran indomitable will that never flagged in the face of adversity    Sometimes he blundered badly  often he oversimplified  yet he saw his goals clearly and moved toward them relentlessly     Brooks Simpson continued the trend in the first of two volumes on Grant in 2000  although the work was far from a hagiography    H  W  Brands   in his more uniformly positive 2012 book  wrote favorably of Grant s military and political careers alike  saying   As commanding general in the Civil War  he had defeated secession and destroyed slavery  secession s cause  As President during Reconstruction he had guided the South back into the Union  By the end of his public life the Union was more secure than at any previous time in the history of the nation  And no one had done more to produce the result than he     As Eric Foner wrote  Brands gave  a sympathetic account of Grant s forceful and temporarily successful effort as president to crush the Ku Klux Klan  which had inaugurated a reign of terror against the former slaves   Foner adds that by 1875 Grant had given up rescuing the blacks  saying the public was tired of them  concluding that  Grant s unwillingness to act reflected the broader Northern retreat from Reconstruction and its ideal of racial equality      Besides civil rights  issues of environmental protection have also attracted historiographical attention  Historian Joan Waugh  in her generally favorable book  says Grant appreciated the beauty of the West  and in 1872 signed the law establishing the country s first national park at Yellowstone   However  she argues      he approved of projects that took great swaths of land and opened them to timber  cattle  land speculators  and millions of settlers    the idea of preserving the region s environment and concerns about industrial pollution were of much less importance to Grant       Throughout the 20th century  historians ranked his presidency near the bottom  In the 21st century  his military reputation is strong  while experts rank his presidential achievements well below average     Several memorials honor Grant  In addition to his mausoleum  the General Grant National Memorial in New York  there are the Ulysses S  Grant Memorial at the foot of Capitol Hill on the mall in Washington  D C     the Ulysses S  Grant National Historic Site near St  Louis  and several other sites in Ohio and Illinois that honor his life    There are smaller memorials in Chicago s Lincoln Park and Philadelphia s Fairmount Park   Named in his honor are Grant Park as well as several counties in western and midwestern states   From 1890 to 1940  part of what is now Kings Canyon National Park was called General Grant National Park   named for the General Grant sequoia     Grant has appeared on the front of the United States fifty dollar bill since 1913  and appears on several stamps    In May 2012  the Ulysses S  Grant Foundation  on the institute s fiftieth anniversary  selected Mississippi State University as the permanent location for Ulysses S  Grant s presidential library     Historian John Y  Simon edited Grant s letters into a 32 volume scholarly edition published by Southern Illinois University Press     ", "Taylor": "Early life Marriage and family Military

July 1850  Before his presidency  Taylor was a career officer in the United States Army   rising to the rank of major general    Taylor s status as a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican American War won him election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs  His top priority as president was preserving the Union  but he died seventeen months into his term  before making any progress on the status of slavery   which had been inflaming tensions in Congress   Taylor was born into a prominent family of planters who migrated westward from Virginia to Kentucky in his youth  He was commissioned as an officer in the U S  Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812   He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832  His success in the Second Seminole War attracted national attention and earned him the nickname  Old Rough and Ready    In 1845  as the annexation of Texas was underway  President James K  Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande area in anticipation of a potential battle with Mexico over the disputed TexasMexico border  The MexicanAmerican War broke out in May 1846  and Taylor led American troops to victory in a series of battles culminating in the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Monterrey   He became a national hero  and political clubs sprang up to draw him into the upcoming 1848 presidential election    The Whig Party convinced the reluctant Taylor to lead their ticket  despite his unclear platform and lack of interest in politics  He won the election alongside former U S  Representative Millard Fillmore of New York   defeating Democratic candidates Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler   As president  Taylor kept his distance from Congress and his cabinet  even as partisan tensions threatened to divide the Union  Debate over the slave status of the large territories claimed in the war led to threats of secession from Southerners   Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself  Taylor did not push for the expansion of slavery  To avoid the question  he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood   setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850   Taylor died suddenly of a stomach related illness in July 1850  ensuring he would have little impact on the sectional divide that led to civil war a decade later     Taylor was born on November 24  1784  on a plantation in Orange County  Virginia   to a prominent family of planters of English ancestry  He is inconclusively believed to have been born at the home of his maternal grandfather  Hare Forest Farm     He was the third of five surviving sons in his family  a sixth died in infancy  and had three younger sisters  His mother was Sarah Dabney  Strother  Taylor  His father  Richard Taylor   had served as a lieutenant colonel in the American Revolution      Taylor was a descendant of Elder William Brewster   the Pilgrim colonist leader of the Plymouth Colony   a Mayflower immigrant  and one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact   and Isaac Allerton Jr    a colonial merchant and colonel who was the son of Mayflower Pilgrim Isaac Allerton and Fear Brewster   Taylor s second cousin through that line was James Madison   the fourth president     Leaving exhausted lands  his family joined the westward migration out of Virginia and settled near what developed as Louisville  Kentucky   on the Ohio River   Taylor grew up in a small woodland cabin before his family moved to a brick house with increased prosperity  The rapid growth of Louisville was a boon for Taylor s father  who came to own 10 000 acres  40km 2   throughout Kentucky by the start of the 19th century  he held 26 slaves to cultivate the most developed portion of his holdings  There were no formal schools on the Kentucky frontier  and Taylor had a sporadic formal education  A schoolmaster recalled Taylor as a quick learner  His early letters show a weak grasp of spelling and grammar  and his handwriting was later described as  that of a near illiterate      In June 1810  Taylor married Margaret Mackall Smith   whom he had met the previous autumn in Louisville   Peggy  Smith came from a prominent family of Maryland planters  she was the daughter of Major Walter Smith  who had served in the Revolutionary War    The couple had six children   On May 3  1808  Taylor joined the U S  Army  receiving a commission as a first lieutenant of the Seventh Infantry Regiment   He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress in response to the ChesapeakeLeopard Affair   in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship  sparking calls for war    Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of New Orleans and nearby Terre aux Boeufs  He was promoted to captain in November 1810  His army duties were limited at this time  and he attended to his personal finances  Over the next several years  he began to purchase slaves and a good deal of bank stock in Louisville    He bought a plantation in Louisville for  95 000 that had 83 slaves attached to it  as well as the Cypress Grove Plantation near Rodney   Jefferson County   Mississippi   bringing the total number of slaves under him above 200      In July 1811 he was called to the Indiana Territory   where he assumed control of Fort Knox after the commandant fled  In only a few weeks  he was able to restore order in the garrison  for which he was lauded by Governor William Henry Harrison      During the War of 1812   in which U S  forces battled the British Empire and its Indian allies  Taylor successfully defended Fort Harrison in Indiana Territory from an Indian attack commanded by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh   Taylor gained recognition and received a brevet  temporary  promotion to the rank of major  Later that year he joined General Samuel Hopkins as an aide on two expeditions  the first into the Illinois Territory and the second to the Tippecanoe battle site  where they were forced to retreat in the Battle of Wild Cat Creek     Taylor moved his growing family to Fort Knox after the violence subsided  In spring 1814  he was called back into action under Brigadier General Benjamin Howard   That October he supervised the construction of Fort Johnson   the last toehold of the U S  Army in the upper Mississippi River Valley  Upon Howard s death a few weeks later  Taylor was ordered to abandon the fort and retreat to Saint Louis   Reduced to the rank of captain when the war ended in 1815  he resigned from the army  He re entered it a year later after gaining a commission as a major     For two years  Taylor commanded Fort Howard at the Green Bay   Michigan Territory   settlement  He then returned to Louisville and his family  In April 1819 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and dined with President James Monroe     In late 1821  Taylor took the 7th Infantry to Natchitoches  Louisiana   on the Red River  On the orders of General Edmund P  Gaines   they set out to locate a new post more convenient to the Sabine River frontier  By the following March  Taylor had established Fort Jesup   at the Shield s Spring site southwest of Natchitoches  That November he was transferred to Fort Robertson at Baton Rouge   where he remained until February 1824    He spent the next few years on recruiting duty  In late 1826 he was called to Washington  D C   to work on an Army committee to consolidate and improve military organization  In the meantime he acquired his first Louisiana plantation and decided to move with his family to Baton Rouge as their home     In May 1828  Taylor was called back to action  commanding Fort Snelling in Michigan Territory  now Minnesota   on the northern Mississippi River for a year  and nearby Fort Crawford for a year  After some time on furlough  when he expanded his landholdings  Taylor was promoted to colonel of the 1st Infantry Regiment in April 1832    At that time  the Black Hawk War was beginning in the West  Taylor campaigned under General Henry Atkinson to pursue and later defend against Chief Black Hawk  s forces throughout the summer  The end of the war in August 1832 signaled the end of Indian resistance to U S  expansion in the area  and the following years were relatively quiet  During this period Taylor resisted the courtship of his 17 year old daughter Sarah Knox Taylor and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis   the future President of the Confederate States of America   He respected Davis but did not approve of his daughter becoming a military wife  as he knew it was a hard life for families  Davis and Sarah Taylor married in June 1835  but she died three months later of malaria contracted on a summer visit to Davis  sister in St  Francisville  Louisiana      By 1837  the Second Seminole War was underway when Taylor was directed to Florida  He defeated the Seminole Indians in the Christmas Day Battle of Lake Okeechobee   which was among the largest U S Indian battles of the nineteenth century  He was promoted to brigadier general in recognition of his success  In May 1838  Brig  Gen  Thomas Jesup stepped down and placed Taylor in command of all American troops in Florida  a position he held for two years  His reputation as a military leader was growing  and with it  he began to be known as  Old Rough and Ready      Recommending the importation of Cuban bloodhounds to hunt down the poor Indians  Taylor was widely condemned    After his long requested relief was granted  Taylor spent a comfortable year touring the nation with his family and meeting with military leaders  During this period  he began to be interested in politics and corresponded with President William Henry Harrison  He was made commander of the Second Department of the Army s Western Division in May 1841  The sizable territory ran from the Mississippi River westward  south of the 37th parallel north   Stationed in Arkansas   Taylor enjoyed several uneventful years  spending as much time attending to his land speculation as to military matters     In anticipation of the annexation of the Republic of Texas   which had established independence in 1836  Taylor was sent in April 1844 to Fort Jesup in Louisiana  He was ordered to guard against any attempts by Mexico to reclaim the territory    He served there until July 1845  when annexation became imminent  and President James K  Polk directed him to deploy into disputed territory in Texas   on or near the Rio Grande   near Mexico  Taylor chose a spot at Corpus Christi   and his Army of Occupation encamped there until the following spring in anticipation of a Mexican attack     Taylor s men advanced to the Rio Grande in March 1846  Polk s attempts to negotiate with Mexico had failed  and war appeared imminent  Violence broke out several weeks later  when some of Captain Seth B  Thornton s men were attacked by Mexican forces near the river    Polk  learning of the Thornton Affair   told Congress in May that a war between Mexico and the U S  had begun    That same month  Taylor commanded American forces at the Battle of Palo Alto and the nearby Battle of Resaca de la Palma   defeating the Mexican forces  which greatly outnumbered his own    These victories made him a popular hero  and within weeks he received a brevet promotion to major general and a formal commendation from Congress  The national press compared him to George Washington and Andrew Jackson   both generals who had ascended to the presidency  although Taylor denied any interest in running for office   Such an idea never entered my head   he remarked in a letter   nor is it likely to enter the head of any sane person      In September  Taylor inflicted heavy casualties upon the Mexican defenders at the Battle of Monterrey   The city of Monterrey had been considered  impregnable   but was captured in three days  forcing Mexican forces to retreat  Taylor was criticized for signing a  liberal  truce  rather than pressing for a large scale surrender    Afterwards  half of Taylor s army was ordered to join General Winfield Scott  s soldiers as they besieged Veracruz   Mexican General Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna discovered  through an intercepted letter from Scott  that Taylor had contributed all but 6 000 of his men to the effort  His remaining force included only a few hundred regular army soldiers  and Santa Anna resolved to take advantage of the situation   Santa Anna attacked Taylor with 20 000 men at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847  leaving around 700 Americans dead or wounded at a cost of over 1 500 Mexican    b   Outmatched  the Mexican forces retreated  ensuring a  far reaching  victory for the Americans     In recognition of his victory at Buena Vista  Taylor was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati on July 4  1847  Taylor s father had been an Original Member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati  Unfortunately for the younger Taylor  the Virginia society had disbanded shortly before the elder Taylor s death  which prevented him from succeeding to his father s  seat  in the Society  Taylor was a member of the Aztec Club of 1847   Military Society of the Mexican War     Taylor remained at Monterrey until late November 1847  when he set sail for home  While he would spend the following year in command of the Army s entire western division  his active military career was over  In December he received a hero s welcome in New Orleans and Baton Rouge  and his popular legacy set the stage for the 1848 presidential election     In his capacity as a career officer  Taylor had never reportedly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time    He thought of himself as an independent   believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country  and thought that President Andrew Jackson should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836    He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U S   as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar  both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery  could be easily grown there through a plantation economy     He was also a firm nationalist  and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare  he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems    Taylor  although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements   aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies  the President should not be able to veto a law  unless that law was against the Constitution   that the office should not interfere with Congress   and that the power of collective decision making  as well as the Cabinet   should be strong     Well before the American victory at Buena Vista  political clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President  His support was drawn from an unusually broad assortment of political bands  including Whigs and Democrats  Northerners and Southerners  allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K  Polk  By late 1846 Taylor s opposition to a presidential run began to weaken  and it became clear that his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy  Still  he maintained that he would only accept election as a national  independent figure  rather than a partisan loyalist    Taylor declared  as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached  that he had always been a Whig in principle  but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian Democrat     Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico  and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso   which proposed against such an expansion    This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U S   as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso  not simply fail to veto it    Most abolitionists did not support Taylor  since he was a slave owner    Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states  rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements    The Whigs hoped that he put the federal union of the United States above all else     Taylor received the Whig nomination for President in 1848  For his Vice Presidential nominee the convention chose Millard Fillmore   a prominent New York Whig who had chaired the House Ways and Means Committee and had been a contender for Henry Clay s Vice Presidential nominee in the 1844 election   Fillmore s selection was largely an attempt at reconciliation with northern Whigs  who were furious at the election of a slaveowning southerner  all factions of the party were dissatisfied with the final ticket    Taylor continued to minimize his role in the campaign  preferring not to directly meet with voters or correspond regarding his political views  His campaign was skillfully directed by Senator John J  Crittenden of Kentucky  a friend and early political supporter  and bolstered by a late endorsement from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts    Taylor defeated Lewis Cass   the Democratic candidate  and Martin Van Buren   the Free Soil candidate   Taylor ignored the Whig platform  as historian Michael F  Holt explains   Taylor was equally indifferent to programs Whigs had long considered vital  Publicly  he was artfully ambiguous  refusing to answer questions about his views on banking  the tariff  and internal improvements  Privately  he was more forthright  The idea of a national bank  is dead  and will not be revived in my time   In the future the tariff  will be increased only for revenue   in other words  Whig hopes of restoring the protective tariff of 1842 were vain  There would never again be surplus federal funds from public land sales to distribute to the states  and internal improvements  will go on in spite of presidential vetoes   In a few words  that is  Taylor pronounced an epitaph for the entire Whig economic program     As president elect  Taylor kept his distance from Washington  not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849  He spent the months following the election formulating his cabinet selections  He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions  to the frustration of his fellow Whigs  While he despised patronage and political games  he endured a flurry of advances from office seekers looking to play a role in his administration     While he would not appoint any Democrats  Taylor wanted his cabinet to reflect the nation s diverse interests  and so apportioned the seats geographically  He also avoided choosing prominent Whigs  sidestepping such obvious selections as Henry Clay  He saw Crittenden as a cornerstone of his administration  offering him the crucial seat of Secretary of State  but Crittenden insisted on serving out the Governorship of Kentucky to which he had just been elected  Taylor settled instead on Senator John M  Clayton of Delaware  a close associate of Crittenden s     Taylor began his trek to Washington in late January  a journey rife with bad weather  delays  injuries  sicknessand an abduction by a family friend  Taylor finally arrived in the nation s capital on February 24 and soon met with the outgoing President Polk    The incumbent Democrat held a low opinion of Taylor  privately deeming him  without political information  and  wholly unqualified for the station  of President    Taylor spent the following week meeting with political elites  some of whom were unimpressed with his appearance and demeanor  With less than two weeks until his inauguration  he met with Clayton and hastily finalized his cabinet     Taylor s term as president began Sunday  March 4  but his inauguration was not held until the following day out of religious concerns    c   His inauguration speech discussed the many tasks facing the nation  but presented a governing style of deference to Congress and sectional compromise instead of assertive executive action    Throughout the summer of 1849  Taylor toured the northeastern U S   to familiarize himself with a region of which he had seen little  He spent much of the trip plagued by gastrointestinal illness and returned to Washington by September     As Taylor took office  Congress faced a battery of questions related to the Mexican Cession   comprising three major territories acquired by the U S  after the Mexican War  California  New Mexico  and Utah  It was unclear which of the acquisitions would achieve statehood and which would remain federal territories  while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress  While a southern slaveowner himself  Taylor had no particular bias toward the southern faction of Congress which sought to maintain its right to slavery  His major goal was sectional peace  preserving the Union through legislative compromise    As the threat of Southern secession grew  he sided increasingly with northern abolitionists such as Senator William H  Seward of New York  even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk     In Taylor s view  the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory  as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress s hands  The timing for statehood was in Taylor s favor  as the Gold Rush was well underway at the time of his inauguration  and California s population was exploding    The administration dispatched Rep  Thomas Butler King to California  to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood  knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti slavery constitution  King found that a constitutional convention was already underway  and by October 1849  the convention unanimously agreed to join the Unionand to ban slavery within their borders     The question of the New MexicoTexas border was unsettled at the time of Taylor s inauguration  The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction  but the Texans claimed a swath of land north of Santa Fe and were determined to include it within their borders  despite having no significant presence there  Taylor sided with the New Mexicans  claim  initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory  but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce the slavery debate in Congress  The Texas government  under newly instated governor P  Hansborough Bell   tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government  but was unsuccessful     The Latter Day Saint settlers of modern day Utah had established a provisional State of Deseret   an enormous swath of territory which had little hope of recognition by Congress  The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories  but instead opted to organize the Utah Territory   To alleviate the Mormon population s concerns over religious freedom  Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory     Taylor sent his only State of the Union report to Congress in December 1849  He recapped international events and suggested several adjustments to tariff policy and executive organization  but such issues were overshadowed by the sectional crisis facing Congress  He reported on California s and New Mexico s applications for statehood  and recommended that Congress approve them as written and  should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character     The policy report was prosaic and unemotional  but ended with a sharp condemnation of secessionists  It had no effect on Southern legislators  who saw the admission of two free states as an existential threat  and Congress remained stalled     Taylor and his Secretary of State  John M  Clayton   both lacked diplomatic experience  and came into office at a relatively uneventful time in Americaninternational politics  Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight  although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration    As opponents of the autocratic European order  they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848   although they offered little in the way of aid    A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced  and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration  In a more positive effort  the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom s search for a team of British explorers  led by John Franklin   who had gotten lost in the Arctic    While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative  the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East      Throughout 1849 and 1850  they contended with Narciso Lpez   the Venezuelan radical who led repeated filibustering expeditions in an attempt to conquer the island of Cuba   While Lpez made generous offers to American military leaders to support him  Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal  They issued a blockade  and later  authorized a mass arrest of Lpez and his fellows  although the group would eventually be acquitted    They also confronted Spain  which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy  but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to maintain good relations with the U S     Arguably the Taylor administration s definitive accomplishment in foreign policy was the ClaytonBulwer Treaty of 1850  regarding a proposed inter oceanic canal through Central America  While the U S  and Britain were on friendly terms  and the construction of such a canal was decades away from reality  the mere possibility put the two nations in an uneasy position    For several years  Britain had been seizing strategic points  particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present day Nicaragua   Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark ClaytonBulwer Treaty  Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua  The treaty promoted development of an Anglo American alliance  its completion was Taylor s last action as president     Senate Majority Leader Henry Clay took a central role as Congress debated the statehood question  While his positions had some overlap with Taylor s  the president always maintained his distance from Clay  Historians disagree on his motivations for doing so    With assistance from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts  Clay developed his landmark proposal  the Compromise of 1850   The proposal allowed statehood for California  giving it independence on the slavery question  while the other territories would remain under federal jurisdiction  This would include the disputed parts of New Mexico  although Texas would be reimbursed for the territory  Slavery would be retained in the District of Columbia  but the slave trade would be banned  Meanwhile  a strict Fugitive Slave Law would be enacted  bypassing northern legislation which had restricted Southerners from retrieving runaway slaves    Tensions flared as Congress negotiated and secession talks grew  culminating with a threat from Taylor to send troops into New Mexico to protect its border from Texas  with himself leading the army  Taylor also said that anyone  taken in rebellion against the Union  he would hang     with less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico     The omnibus law was a major step forward but ultimately could not pass  due to extremists on both sides     No great compromise reached Taylor s desk during his presidency  instead  his last days were overshadowed by the Galphin affair   Before joining the Taylor cabinet  Secretary of War George W  Crawford had served as a lawyer  He had been involved in a fifteen year case  representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid at the time of the American Revolution  The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government  but Galphin s heirs only received payment on the debt s principal after years of litigation  and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration   Taylor s Treasury Secretary William M  Meredith  with the support of Attorney General Reverdy Johnson  finally signed off on the payment in April 1850  To the president s embarrassment  this payment included a legal compensation of nearly  100 000 to Crawford  two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the public treasury to another  A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing  but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment  Taylor  who had already been sketching out a re organization of his cabinet  now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation     On July 4  1850  Taylor reportedly consumed raw fruit and iced milk after attending holiday celebrations and a fund raising event at the Washington Monument   which was then under construction      Over the course of several days  he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment  His doctor  diagnosed the illness as cholera morbus  a flexible mid nineteenth century term for intestinal ailments as diverse as diarrhea and dysentery but not related to Asiatic cholera   the latter being a widespread epidemic at the time of Taylor s death    The identity and source of Taylor s illness are the subject of historical speculation  see below   although it is known that several of his cabinet members had come down with a similar illness     Fever ensued and Taylor s chance of recovery was small  On July 8  Taylor remarked to a medical attendant   I should not be surprised if this were to terminate in my death  I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency  God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty  But I have been mistaken  My motives have been misconstrued  and my feelings most grossly outraged     Despite treatment  Taylor died at 10 35p m  on July 9  1850  He was 65 years old     Taylor was interred in the Public Vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington  D C   from July 13  1850  to October 25  1850   It was built in 1835 to hold remains of notables until either the grave site could be prepared or transportation arranged to another city   His body was transported to the Taylor Family plot where his parents were buried on the old Taylor homestead plantation known as  Springfield  in Louisville  Kentucky   Because of his short tenure  Taylor is not considered to have strongly influenced the office of the Presidency or the U S    Some historians believe that Taylor was too inexperienced with politics  at a time when officials needed close ties with political operatives    Despite his shortcomings  the ClaytonBulwer Treaty affecting relations with Great Britain in Central America is  recognized as an important step in scaling down the nation s commitment to Manifest Destiny as a policy     While historical rankings of Presidents of the United States have generally placed Taylor in the bottom quarter of chief executives  most surveys tend to rank him as the most effective of the four Presidents from the Whig Party   Taylor was the last President to own slaves while in office  He was the third of four Whig presidents    f   the last being Fillmore  his successor  Taylor was also the second president to die in office  preceded by William Henry Harrison who died while serving as President nine years earlier  as well as the only President elected from Louisiana    In 1883  the Commonwealth of Kentucky placed a fifty foot monument topped by a life sized statue of Taylor near his grave  By the 1920s  the Taylor family initiated the effort to turn the Taylor burial grounds into a national cemetery  The Commonwealth of Kentucky donated two adjacent parcels of land for the project  turning the half acre Taylor family cemetery into 16 acres  65 000m 2    On May 6  1926  the remains of Taylor and his wife  who died in 1852  were moved to the newly constructed Taylor mausoleum  made of limestone with a granite base and marble interior  nearby  The cemetery property has been designated as the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery      The US Post Office released the first postage stamp issue honoring Zachary Taylor on June 21  1875  25 years after his death  In 1938  Taylor would appear again on a US Postage stamp  this time on the 12 cent Presidential Issue of 1938   Taylor s last appearance  to date  2010  on a US postage stamp occurred in 1986 when he was honored on the AMERIPEX presidential issue   After Washington  Jefferson  Jackson and Lincoln  Zachary Taylor was the fifth American president to appear on US postage     He is the namesake for several names and places throughout the United States  including   He was also the namesake for architect Zachary Taylor Davis    Almost immediately after his death  rumors began to circulate that Taylor was poisoned by pro slavery Southerners  and similar theories persisted into the twentieth century    In 1978  Hamilton Smith based his assassination theory on the timing of drugs  the lack of confirmed cholera outbreaks  and other material    In the late 1980s  Clara Rising  a former professor at University of Florida  persuaded Taylor s closest living relative to agree to an exhumation so that his remains could be tested    The remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner on June17  1991  Samples of hair  fingernail  and other tissues were removed  and radiological studies were conducted  The remains were returned to the cemetery and reinterred  with appropriate honors  in the mausoleum     Neutron activation analysis conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory revealed no evidence of poisoning  as arsenic levels were too low      The analysis concluded Taylor had contracted   cholera morbus   or acute gastroenteritis    as Washington had open sewers  and his food or drink may have been contaminated  Any potential for recovery was overwhelmed by his doctors  who treated him with   ipecac   calomel   opium   and quinine  at 40grains a whack   and bled and blistered him too     Political scientist Michael Parenti questions the traditional explanation for Taylor s death  Relying on interviews and reports by forensic pathologists  he argues that the procedure used to test for arsenic poisoning was fundamentally flawed      A 2010 review concludes   there is no definitive proof that Taylor was assassinated  nor would it appear that there is definitive proof that he was not      General biographies  Political history  Genealogy ", "Buchanan": "Early life Political career Presidential election of 1856 Presidency  281857 E2 80 931861 29

represented Pennsylvania in the United States House of Representatives and later the Senate   then served as Minister to Russia under President Andrew Jackson   He was named Secretary of State under President James K  Polk   and is to date the last former Secretary of State to serve as President of the United States  After Buchanan turned down an offer to sit on the Supreme Court   President Franklin Pierce appointed him Ambassador to the United Kingdom   in which capacity he helped draft the Ostend Manifesto    Buchanan was nominated by the Democratic Party in the 1856 presidential election   Throughout most of Pierce s term  he had been stationed in London as a minister to the Court of St  James s   so was not caught up in the crossfire of sectional politics that dominated the country  His subsequent election victory took place in a three man race with John C  Frmont and Millard Fillmore   As President  he was often called a   doughface    a Northerner with Southern sympathies  who battled with Stephen A  Douglas for control of the Democratic Party   Buchanan s efforts to maintain peace between the North and the South alienated both sides  and the Southern states declared their secession in the prologue to the American Civil War   Buchanan s view of record was that secession was illegal  but that going to war to stop it was also illegal  Buchanan  an attorney  was noted for his mantra   I acknowledge no master but the law      By the time he left office  popular opinion was against him  and the Democratic Party had split  Buchanan had once aspired to be a president that would rank in history with George Washington     However  his inability to identify a ground for peace or address the sharply divided proslavery and antislavery partisans with a unifying principle on the brink of the Civil War has led to his consistent ranking by historians as one of the worst presidents in American history  Historians in both 2006 and 2009 voted his failure to deal with secession the worst presidential mistake ever made     He is  to date  the only president from Pennsylvania and the only president to remain a lifelong bachelor   He is also the last president born in the 18th century     Buchanan was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap  Pennsylvania  now Buchanan s Birthplace State Park    in Franklin County   on April 23  1791  to James Buchanan  Sr   17611821   a businessman  merchant  and farmer  and Elizabeth Speer  an educated woman  17671833     His parents were both of Ulster Scots descent  the father having emigrated from Donegal   Ireland  in 1783  Buchanan had six sisters and four brothers     In 1797  the family moved to nearby Mercersburg  Pennsylvania   The home in Mercersburg was later turned into the James Buchanan Hotel      Buchanan attended the village academy  Old Stone Academy  and later Dickinson College in Carlisle  Pennsylvania   Though he was nearly expelled at one point for poor behavior  he pleaded for a second chance and subsequently graduated with honors on September 19  1809    Later that year  he moved to Lancaster   where he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1812   A dedicated Federalist   he initially opposed the War of 1812 because he believed it was an unnecessary conflict  When the British invaded neighboring Maryland   he joined a volunteer light dragoon unit as a private and served in the defense of Baltimore     Buchanan is the only president with military experience who did not  at some point  serve as an officer     An active Freemason   he was the Master of Masonic Lodge No  43 in Lancaster  Pennsylvania  and a District Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania      Buchanan began his political career in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1814 to 1816 as a member of the Federalist Party     He was elected to the 17th United States Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses  March 4  1821 March 4  1831   serving as chairman of the U S  House Committee on the Judiciary in the 21st United States Congress   In 1830  he was among the members appointed by the House to conduct impeachment proceedings against James H  Peck   judge of the United States District Court for the District of Missouri   Peck was charged with abuse of the contempt power  but was ultimately acquitted    Buchanan did not seek reelection  and from 1832 to 1833  he served as Minister to Russia   appointed by Andrew Jackson    With the Federalist Party long defunct  Buchanan was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill a vacancy and served from December 1834  he was reelected in 1837 and 1843  and resigned in 1845 to accept nomination of him as Secretary of State by President James K  Polk   He was chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations from 1836 to 1841     After the death of Supreme Court Justice Henry Baldwin in 1844  Polk nominated Buchanan to fill the vacancy in March 1845  but he declined that nomination because he felt compelled to complete his collaboration on the Oregon Treaty negotiations  The seat was eventually filled by Robert Cooper Grier      Buchanan served as Secretary of State under Polk from 1845 to 1849  despite objections from Buchanan s rival  Vice President George Dallas     In this capacity  he helped negotiate the 1846 Oregon Treaty establishing the 49th parallel as the northern boundary of the western United States    No Secretary of State has become President since Buchanan  although William Howard Taft   the 27th President of the United States  often served as Acting Secretary of State during the Theodore Roosevelt administration   In 1852  Buchanan was named president of the Board of Trustees of Franklin and Marshall College in his hometown of Lancaster  Pennsylvania  and he served in this capacity until 1866    despite a false report that he was fired     He served as minister to the Court of St  James s  Britain  from 1853 to 1856  during which time he helped to draft a memorandum that became known as the Ostend Manifesto   He signed the memorandum along with Pierre Soul and John Mason   This document proposed the purchase from Spain of Cuba   then in the midst of revolution and near bankruptcy  declaring the island  as necessary to the North American republic as any of its present     family of states   Against Buchanan s recommendation  the final draft of the manifesto suggested that  wresting it from Spain  if Spain refused to sell would be justified  by every law  human and Divine     The manifesto  generally considered a blunder overall  was never acted upon  but weakened the Pierce administration and support for Manifest Destiny        In 1856  Democrats selected Buchanan as their nominee for President of the United States  He had been in England during the Kansas Nebraska debate and thus remained untainted by either side    Pennsylvania  which had three times failed Buchanan  now gave him full support in its state convention  Though he never declared his candidacy  it is apparent from all his correspondence that he was aware of the distinct possibility of his nomination by the Democratic convention in Cincinnati  even before heading home at the finish of his work as Minister to the Court of St  James in the United Kingdom  Writer Nathaniel Hawthorne   then serving as American Consul in Liverpool  recorded in his diary that Buchanan visited him in January 1855   He returns to America  he says  next October  and then retires forever from public life    as regards his prospects for the Presidency   h e said that his mind was fully made up  and that he would never be a candidate  and that he had expressed this decision to his friends in such a way as to put it out of his own power to change it    that it was now too late  and that he was too old    although  really  he is the only Democrat  at this moment  whom it would not be absurd to talk of for the office     I wonder whether he can have had any object in saying all this to me  He might see that it would be perfectly natural for me to tell it to General Pierce     Jonathan Foltz told Buchanan in November 1855   The people have taken the next presidency out of the hands of the politicians   the people and not your political friends will place you there   While Buchanan did not overtly seek the office  he most deliberately chose not to discourage the movement on his behalf  something that was well within his power on many occasions     Former president Millard Fillmore  s   Know Nothing   candidacy helped Buchanan defeat John C  Frmont   the first Republican candidate for president in 1856  He served as president from March 4  1857  to March 4  1861  Buchanan remains the most recent of the two Democrats  the other being Martin Van Buren   to succeed a fellow Democrat to the Presidency by election in his own right  President elect Buchanan stated about the growing schism in the country   The object of my administration will be to destroy sectional party  North or South  and to restore harmony to the Union under a national and conservative government     He set about this initially by maintaining a sectional balance in his appointments and persuading the people to accept constitutional law as the Supreme Court interpreted it  The court was considering the legality of restricting slavery in the territories and two justices had hinted to Buchanan their findings     Buchanan was the last president born in the 18th century and  at age 65  was the second oldest man to be elected President at that time   In his inaugural address  besides promising not to run again  Buchanan referred to the territorial question as  happily  a matter of but little practical importance  since the Supreme Court was about to settle it  speedily and finally   and proclaimed that when the decision came  he would  cheerfully submit  whatever this may be   Two days later  Chief Justice Roger B  Taney delivered the Dred Scott decision   asserting that Congress had no constitutional power to exclude slavery in the territories  Such comments delighted Southerners and incited anger in the North     Buchanan preferred to see the territorial question resolved by the Supreme Court  He wrote to Justice John Catron in January 1857  inquiring about the outcome of the case and suggesting that a broader decision would be more prudent    Catron  who was from Tennessee   replied on February 10 that the Supreme Court s southern majority would decide against Scott  but would likely have to publish the decision on narrow grounds if there was no support from the Court s northern justicesunless Buchanan could convince his fellow Pennsylvanian  Justice Robert Cooper Grier   to join the majority      Buchanan then wrote to Grier and successfully prevailed upon him  allowing the majority leverage to issue a broad ranging decision that transcended the specific circumstances of Scott s case to declare the Missouri Compromise of 1820 unconstitutional      The correspondence was not public at the time  however  at his inauguration  Buchanan was seen in whispered conversation with Chief Justice Roger B  Taney  When the decision was issued two days later  Republicans began spreading word that Taney had revealed to Buchanan the forthcoming result    Abraham Lincoln   in his 1858 House Divided Speech   denounced Buchanan  Taney  Stephen A  Douglas and Franklin Pierce as accomplices of the Slave Power   a supposed oligarchy aiming to eliminate legal barriers to slavery     The Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854 created Kansas Territory   and allowed the settlers there to choose whether to allow slavery  This resulted in violence between   Free Soil    antislavery  and proslavery settlers in what became known as the   Bleeding Kansas   crisis   The antislavery settlers organized a government in Topeka   while proslavery settlers established a seat of government in Lecompton  Kansas   For Kansas to be admitted to statehood  a state constitution had to be submitted to Congress with the approval of a majority of residents   Toward this end  Buchanan appointed Robert J  Walker as territorial governor  with the mission of reconciling the settler factions and approving a constitution  Walker  who was from Mississippi   was expected to assist the proslavery faction in gaining approval of their Lecompton Constitution   However  most Kansas settlers were Free Soilers  The Lecomptonites held a referendum  which Free Soilers boycotted  with trick terms and claimed their constitution was adopted  Walker resigned in disgust     Nevertheless  Buchanan now pushed for congressional approval of Kansas statehood under the Lecompton Constitution  Buchanan made every effort to secure congressional approval  offering favors  patronage appointments  and even cash for votes  The Lecompton bill passed through the House of Representatives  but failed in the Senate  where it was opposed by Senator Stephen A  Douglas of Illinois   leader of the northern Democrats  Douglas advocated  popular sovereignty   letting settlers decide on slaverynicknamed   squatter sovereignty   by Douglas  opponents   he rejected the fraudulent way the Lecompton Constitution was supposedly adopted     The battle over Kansas escalated into a battle for control of the Democratic Party  On one side were Buchanan  most Southern Democrats  and northern Democrats allied to the Southerners   Doughfaces    on the other side were Douglas and most northern Democrats plus a few Southerners  The struggle lasted from 1857 to 1860  Buchanan used his patronage powers to remove Douglas  sympathizers in Illinois and Washington  DC and installed proadministration Democrats  including postmasters     Douglas s Senate term ended in 1859  so the Illinois legislature elected in 1858 had to choose whether or not to re elect him  The Senate choice was the primary issue of the legislative election  marked by the famous Lincoln Douglas debates   Buchanan  working through Federal patronage appointees in Illinois  ran candidates for the legislature in competition with both the Republicans and the Douglas Democrats  This could easily have thrown the election to the Republicanswhich showed the depth of Buchanan s animosity toward Douglas     In the end  however  the Danite vote was insignificant  Douglas Democrats won the legislative election and Douglas was re elected to the Senate  Douglas forces took control throughout the North  except in Buchanan s home state of Pennsylvania  Buchanan was reduced to a narrow base of southern supporters       Buchanan considered the essence of good self government to be founded on restraint  The constitution he considered to be     restraints  imposed not by arbitrary authority  but by the people upon themselves and their representatives     In an enlarged view  the people s interests may seem identical  but  to the eye of local and sectional prejudice  they always appear to be conflicting     and the jealousies that will perpetually arise can be repressed only by the mutual forbearance which pervades the constitution      One of the greatest issues of the day was tariffs  Buchanan condemned both free trade and prohibitive tariffs  since either would benefit one section of the country to the detriment of the other  As the senator from Pennsylvania  he thought   I am viewed as the strongest advocate of protection in other states  whilst I am denounced as its enemy in Pennsylvania      Buchanan  like many of his time  was torn between his desire to expand the country for the benefit of all and his insistence on guaranteeing to the people settling the expanded areas their rights  including slavery  On territorial expansion  he said   What  sir  Prevent the people from crossing the Rocky Mountains  You might just as well command the Niagara not to flow  We must fulfill our destiny     On the resulting spread of slavery  through unconditional expansion  he stated   I feel a strong repugnance by any act of mine to extend the present limits of the Union over a new slave holding territory   For instance  he hoped the acquisition of Texas would  be the means of limiting  not enlarging  the dominion of slavery      Nevertheless  in deference to the intentions of the typical slaveholder  he was quick to provide the benefit of much doubt  In his third annual message  Buchanan claimed that the slaves were  treated with kindness and humanity     Both the philanthropy and the self interest of the master have combined to produce this humane result      Historian Kenneth Stampp wrote   Shortly after his election  he assured a southern Senator that the  great object  of his administration would be  to arrest  if possible  the agitation of the Slavery question in the North and to destroy sectional parties  Should a kind Providence enable me to succeed in my efforts to restore harmony to the Union  I shall feel that I have not lived in vain   In the northern anti slavery idiom of his day  Buchanan was often considered a  doughface   a northern man with southern principles     The President  however  also felt that  this question of domestic slavery is the weak point in our institutions  touch this question seriously     and the Union is from that moment dissolved  Although in Pennsylvania we are all opposed to slavery in the abstract  we can never violate the constitutional compact we have with our sister states  Their rights will be held sacred by us  Under the constitution it is their own question  and there let it remain      Buchanan was irked that the abolitionists  in his view  were preventing the solution to the slavery problem  He stated   Before  the abolitionists  commenced this agitation  a very large and growing party existed in several of the slave states in favor of the gradual abolition of slavery  and now not a voice is heard there in support of such a measure  The abolitionists have postponed the emancipation of the slaves in three or four states for at least half a century      Buchanan greatly valued education  but believed that colleges were the duty of state governments rather than the central government  as expressed in his veto of a bill to grant land for colleges    It is extremely doubtful  to say the least  whether this bill would contribute to the advancement of agriculture and the mechanic arts  objects the dignity and value of which can not be too highly appreciated     The Federal Government  which makes the donation  has confessedly no constitutional power to follow it into the States and enforce the application of the fund to the intended objects  As donors we shall possess no control over our own gift after it shall have passed from our hands  It is true that the State legislatures are required to stipulate that they will faithfully execute the trust in the manner prescribed by the bill  But should they fail to do this  what would be the consequence  The Federal Government has no power  and ought to have no power  to compel the execution of the trust    Near the end of his administration  he had a serious exchange with the Rev  William Paxton  After what Paxton described as quite a probative discussion  Buchanan said    Well  sir     I hope I am a Christian  I have much of the experience you have described  and as soon as I retire  I will unite with the Presbyterian Church   Paxton asked why he delayed  to which he replied   I must delay for the honor of religion  If I were to unite with the church now  they would say  hypocrite  from Maine to Georgia      The Panic of 1857 began in summer of that year  brought on mostly by the people s overconsumption of goods from Europe to such an extent that the Union s specie was drained off  overbuilding by competing railroads  and rampant land speculation in the west  Most of the state banks had overextended credit  to more than  7 00 for each dollar of gold or silver  The Republicans considered the Congress to be the culprit for having recently reduced tariffs   Buchanan s response  outlined in his first Annual Message to Congress  was  reform not relief   While the government was  without the power to extend relief     it would continue to pay its debts in specie  and while it would not curtail public works  none would be added  He urged the states to restrict the banks to a credit level of  3 to  1 of specie  and discouraged the use of federal or state bonds as security for bank note issues  The economy did eventually recover  though many Americans suffered as a result of the panic    The South  due to an agriculture based economy  was considered to have been less severely affected than the North  where manufacturers were hardest hit  Buchanan  by the time he left office in 1861  had accumulated a federal deficit of  17million     In March 1857  Buchanan received conflicting reports from federal judges in the Utah Territory that their offices had been disrupted and they had been driven from their posts by the Mormons   He knew that the Pierce administration had refused to facilitate Utah being granted statehood and the Mormons feared the loss of their property rights  Accepting the wildest rumors and believing the Mormons to be in open rebellion against the United States  Buchanan sent the Army in November of that year to replace Brigham Young as governor with the non Mormon Alfred Cumming   While the Mormons  defiance of federal authority in the past had become traditional  some question whether Buchanan s action was a justifiable or prudent response to uncorroborated reports    Complicating matters  Young s notice of his replacement was not delivered because the Pierce administration had annulled the Utah mail contract    After Young reacted to the military action by mustering a two week expedition destroying wagon trains  oxen  and other Army property  Buchanan dispatched Thomas L  Kane as a private agent to negotiate peace  The mission succeeded  the new governor was shortly placed in office  and the Utah War ended  The President granted amnesty to all inhabitants who would respect the authority of the government  and moved the federal troops to a nonthreatening distance for the balance of his administration     The division between northern and southern Democrats allowed the Republicans to win a plurality in the House in the election of 1858   Their control of the chamber allowed the Republicans to block most of Buchanan s agenda  including his proposals for expansion of influence in Central America  and for the purchase of Cuba   Buchanan thought the ideologies of the United States would bring peace and prosperity to these neighboring lands as they had in the Northwest and that without U S  influence  the major European powers would intervene  The imperative of safe and speedy travel from east to west was of strategic importance to the country  These goals would not be reached  Buchanan  in turn  vetoed six substantial pieces of Republican legislation  causing further hostility between Congress and the White House     In March 1860  the House created the Covode committee to investigate the administration for evidence of offenses  some impeachable  such as bribery and extortion of representatives in exchange for their votes  The committee  with three Republicans and two Democrats  was accused by Buchanan s supporters of being nakedly partisan  they also charged its chairman  Republican Rep  John Covode   with acting on a personal grudge  since the president had vetoed a bill that was fashioned as a land grant for new agricultural colleges  but was designed to benefit Covode s railroad company      However  the Democratic committee members  as well as Democratic witnesses  were equally enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan  and as pointed in their condemnations  as the Republicans       The committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan  however  the majority report issued on June 17 exposed corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet  as well as allegations  if not impeachable evidence  from the Republican members of the Committee  that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution   The Democratic report  issued separately the same day  pointed out that evidence was scarce  but did not refute the allegations  one of the Democratic members  Rep  James Robinson   stated publicly that he agreed with the Republican report even though he did not sign it       Buchanan claimed to have  passed triumphantly through this ordeal  with complete vindication  Nonetheless  Republican operatives distributed thousands of copies of the Covode Committee report throughout the nation as campaign material in that year s presidential election       Sectional strife rose to such a pitch that the Democratic Party s national convention in 1860 led directly to a schism in the Party  Buchanan played little part at the national convention  meeting in Charleston  South Carolina   The southern wing walked out of the convention and nominated its own candidate for the presidency  incumbent Vice President John C  Breckinridge   Another faction nominated former Speaker of the House John Bell   who took no position on slavery  his only focus was on saving the Union  The remainder of the party finally nominated Buchanan s archenemy  Stephen Douglas   For his part  President Buchanan supported Breckinridge s candidacy  When the Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln  it was a near certainty that he would be elected   As early as October  the army s Commanding General   Winfield Scott   warned Buchanan that Lincoln s election would likely cause at least seven states to secede  He also recommended to Buchanan that massive amounts of federal troops and artillery be deployed to those states to protect federal property  although he also warned that few reinforcements were available  Congress had since 1857 failed to heed both men s calls for a stronger militia and had allowed the Army to fall into deplorable condition      Buchanan  however  distrusted Scott  the two had long been political adversaries  and ignored his recommendations    After Lincoln s election  Buchanan directed War Secretary Floyd to reinforce southern forts with such provisions  arms and men as were available  however  Floyd convinced him to revoke the order     With Lincoln s victory  talk of secession and disunion reached a boiling point  Buchanan was forced to address it in his final message to Congress  Both factions awaited news of how Buchanan would deal with the question  In his message    Buchanan denied the legal right of states to secede but held that the federal government legally could not prevent them  He placed the blame for the crisis solely on  intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery in the Southern States   and suggested that if they did not  repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments     the injured States  after having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress  would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the Government of the Union     Buchanan s only suggestion to solve the crisis was  an explanatory amendment  reaffirming the constitutionality of slavery in the states  the fugitive slave laws  and popular sovereignty in the territories    His address was sharply criticized both by the north  for its refusal to stop secession  and the south  for denying its right to secede    Five days after the address was delivered  Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb resigned  feeling that his views and the President s had become irreconcilable     Efforts were made by statesmen such as Sen  John J  Crittenden   Rep  Thomas Corwin   and former president John Tyler to negotiate a compromise to stop secession  with Buchanan s support  all failed  Failed efforts to compromise were also made by a group of governors meeting in New York  Buchanan employed a last minute tactic  in secret  to bring a solution  He attempted in vain to procure President elect Lincoln s call for a constitutional convention or national referendum to resolve the issue of slavery  Lincoln declined     South Carolina declared its secession on December 20  1860  followed by six other slave states   and  by February 1861  they had formed the Confederate States of America   As Scott had surmised  the secessionist governments declared eminent domain over federal property within their states  Buchanan and his administration took no action to stop the confiscation of government property   Beginning in late December  Buchanan reorganized his cabinet  ousting Confederate sympathizers and replacing them with hard line nationalists Jeremiah S  Black   Edwin M  Stanton   Joseph Holt and John A  Dix   These conservative Democrats strongly believed in American nationalism and refused to countenance secession  At one point  Treasury Secretary Dix ordered Treasury agents in New Orleans   If any man pulls down the American flag   shoot him on the spot   The new cabinet advised Buchanan to request from Congress the authority to call up militias and give himself emergency military powers  and this he did  on January 8  1861  Nevertheless  by that time Buchanan s relations with Congress were so strained that his requests were rejected out of hand  Many consider him as the worst President in history for his failure to prevent the American Civil War           Before Buchanan left office  all arsenals and forts in the seceding states were lost  except Fort Sumter   off the coast of Charleston  South Carolina   and three island outposts in Florida   and a fourth of all federal soldiers surrendered to the Texas militia  Knowing that secessionist fervor was strongest in South Carolina   Buchanan made a quiet pact with South Carolina s legislators that he would not reinforce the Charleston garrison in exchange for no interference from the state    However  Buchanan did not inform the Charleston commander  Major Robert Anderson   of the agreement  and on December 26 Anderson violated it by moving his command to Fort Sumter  Southerners responded with a demand that Buchanan remove Anderson  while northerners demanded support for the commander  On December 31  in an apparent panic and without consulting Anderson  Buchanan ordered reinforcements     On January 5  Buchanan sent civilian steamer Star of the West to carry reinforcements and supplies to Fort Sumter  which  located in Charleston harbor  was a conspicuously visible spot in the Confederacy  On January 9  1861  South Carolina state batteries opened fire on the ship  causing it to withdraw and return to New York  Buchanan was again criticized by both north  for lack of retaliation against the hostile South Carolina batteries  and south  for attempting to reinforce Fort Sumter   further alienating both factions      Paralyzed  Buchanan made no further moves either to prepare for war or to avert it   On Buchanan s final day as president  March 4  1861  he remarked to the incoming Lincoln   If you are as happy in entering the White House as I shall feel on returning to Wheatland   you are a happy man      Buchanan appointed one Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States   Nathan Clifford   Buchanan appointed only seven other Article III federal judges  all to United States district courts   He also appointed two Article I judges to the United States Court of Claims    The Civil War erupted within two months of Buchanan s retirement  He supported it  writing to former colleagues that  the assault upon Sumter was the commencement of war by the Confederate states  and no alternative was left but to prosecute it with vigor on our part     He also wrote a letter to his fellow Pennsylvania Democrats  urging them to  join the many thousands of brave   patriotic volunteers who are already in the field      However  Buchanan spent most of his remaining years defending himself from public blame for the Civil War  which was even referred to by some as  Buchanan s War     He began receiving angry and threatening letters daily  and stores displayed Buchanan s likeness with the eyes inked red  a noose drawn around his neck and the word  TRAITOR  written across his forehead  The Senate proposed a resolution of condemnation which ultimately failed  and newspapers accused him of colluding with the Confederacy  His former cabinet members  five of whom had been given jobs in the Lincoln administration  refused to defend Buchanan publicly     Initially so disturbed by the attacks that he fell ill and depressed  Buchanan finally began defending himself in October 1862  in an exchange of letters between himself and Winfield Scott that was published in the National Intelligencer newspaper    He soon began writing his fullest public defense  in the form of his memoir Mr  Buchanan s Administration on the Eve of Rebellion   which was published in 1866   Buchanan caught a cold in May 1868  which quickly worsened due to his advanced age  He died on June 1  1868  from respiratory failure at the age of 77 at his home at Wheatland and was interred in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster   In 1818  Buchanan met Anne Caroline Coleman at a grand ball at Lancaster s White Swan Inn  and the two began courting  Anne was the daughter of the wealthy iron manufacturing businessman  and protective father  Robert Coleman and sister in law of Philadelphia judge Joseph Hemphill   one of Buchanan s colleagues from the House of Representatives  By 1819  the two were engaged  but could spend little time together  Buchanan was extremely busy with his law firm and political projects during the Panic of 1819   which took him away from Coleman for weeks at a time  Conflicting rumors abounded  suggesting that he was marrying her for her money  because his own family was less affluent  or that he was involved with other women  Buchanan never publicly spoke of his motives or feelings  but letters from Anne revealed she was paying heed to the rumors   After Buchanan visited a friend s wife  Coleman broke off the engagement  She died suddenly soon afterward  on December 9  1819  The records of a Dr  Chapman  who looked after her in her final hours  and who commented just after her death that it was  the first instance he ever knew of hysteria producing death   reveal that he theorized  despite the absence of any valid evidence  that she had overdosed on laudanum   a concentrated tincture of opium    Buchanan was prevented from attending the funeral service  In a letter to her father  he wrote that  I feel happiness has fled from me forever      After Coleman s death  Buchanan never courted another woman or seemed to show any emotional or physical interest  a rumor circulated of an affair with President James K  Polk  s widow  Sarah Childress Polk   but it had no basis    It has been suggested that Anne s death in fact served to deflect awkward questions about his sexuality and bachelorhood    While Buchanan may have been asexual or celibate   several have put forth arguments that he was homosexual or bisexual   Shelley Ross  biographer Jean Baker  sociologist James W  Loewen   author Robert P  Watson  and historian John Howard     A source of this interest has been Buchanan s close and intimate relationship with William Rufus King  who became Vice President under Franklin Pierce    The two men lived together in a Washington boardinghouse for 10 years from 1834 until King s departure for France in 1844  King referred to the relationship as a  communion     and the two attended social functions together  Contemporaries also noted the closeness  Andrew Jackson called them  Miss Nancy  and  Aunt Fancy   the former being a 19th century euphemism for an effeminate man      while Aaron V  Brown referred to King as Buchanan s  better half     James W  Loewen described Buchanan and King as  siamese twins   In later years  Kat Thompson  the wife of a cabinet member  expressed her anxiety that  there was something unhealthy in the president s attitude      Buchanan adopted King s mannerisms and romanticised view of southern culture  Both had strong political ambitions  and in 1844 they planned to run as president and vice president  One historian has found them both to be soft  effeminate  and eccentric    In May 1844  Buchanan wrote to Cornelia Roosevelt   I am now  solitary and alone   having no companion in the house with me  I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen  but have not succeeded with any one of them  I feel that it is not good for man to be alone  and  I  should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick  provide good dinners for me when I am well  and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection      King became ill in 1853 and died of tuberculosis shortly after Pierce s inauguration  four years before Buchanan became President  Buchanan described him as  among the best  the purest and most consistent public men I have known     The length and intimacy of their surviving letters illustrate  the affection of a special friendship    During Buchanan s presidency  his orphaned niece  Harriet Lane   whom he had adopted  served as official White House hostess     The day before his own death  Buchanan predicted that  history will vindicate my memory     Nevertheless  historians criticize Buchanan for his unwillingness or inability to act in the face of secession  Historical rankings of United States Presidents   considering presidential achievements  leadership qualities  failures and faults  consistently place Buchanan among the least successful presidents      In an academic poll of 47 British academics specializing in American history and politics in 2011  it was reported that he came last  40th   They were asked to evaluate the performance of every president from 1789 to 2009  excluding William Henry Harrison and James Garfield   both of whom died shortly after taking office  in five categories  vision agenda setting  domestic leadership  foreign policy leadership  moral authority and positive historical significance of their legacy     Buchanan biographer Philip Klein put these rankings into context commenting   Buchanan assumed leadership     when an unprecedented wave of angry passion was sweeping over the nation  That he held the hostile sections in check during these revolutionary times was in itself a remarkable achievement  His weaknesses in the stormy years of his presidency were magnified by enraged partisans of the North and South  His many talents  which in a quieter era might have gained for him a place among the great presidents  were quickly overshadowed by the cataclysmic events of civil war and by the towering Abraham Lincoln       Others criticized Buchanan as well  Years before Buchanan won the White House  President James K  Polk confided to his diary   Mr  Buchanan is an able man  but is in small matter without judgment and sometimes acts like an old maid     The National Intelligencer  the leading Whig newspaper of the day  ridiculed Buchanan on January 24  1859  for his follies as president  citing a series of his  magnificent  proposals that all failed   Buchanan is remembered today for other missed opportunities rather than any significant accomplishments  He vetoed the Morrill Act and the Homestead Act   both of which Lincoln signed into law only a few years later  the Homestead Act accelerated westward expansion  while the Morrill Act accelerated agricultural and engineering research and education to develop the young nation   A bronze and granite memorial residing near the southeast corner of Washington  D C  s Meridian Hill Park was designed by architect William Gorden Beecher and sculpted by Maryland artist Hans Schuler   Commissioned in 1916 but not approved by the U S  Congress until 1918  and not completed and unveiled until June 26  1930  the memorial features a statue of Buchanan bookended by male and female classical figures representing law and diplomacy  with the engraved text reading   The incorruptible statesman whose walk was upon the mountain ranges of the law   a quote

States  19091913  and later the 10th Chief Justice of the United States  19211930   A leader during the Progressive Era   Taft and his conservative allies took control of the Republican Party away from Theodore Roosevelt and the liberals  He is the only person to have presided over both the executive and judicial branches of the United States federal government    Before becoming President  Taft served as Solicitor General of the United States and as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit   In 1900  President William McKinley appointed Taft Governor General of the Philippines   In 1904  President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Taft Secretary of War in an effort to groom Taft  then his close political ally  into his handpicked presidential successor  Taft assumed a prominent role in problem solving  assuming on some occasions the role of acting Secretary of State  while declining repeated offers from Roosevelt to serve on the Supreme Court   Riding a wave of popular support for fellow Republican Roosevelt  Taft won an easy victory in his 1908 bid for the presidency     In his only term  Taft s domestic agenda emphasized trust busting   civil service reform   strengthening the Interstate Commerce Commission   improving the performance of the postal service   and passage of the Sixteenth Amendment   Abroad  Taft sought to further the economic development of nations in Latin America and Asia through   Dollar Diplomacy    and showed decisiveness and restraint in response to revolution in Mexico   The task oriented Taft was oblivious to the political ramifications of his decisions  often alienated his own key constituencies   and was overwhelmingly defeated in his bid for a second term in the presidential election of 1912   In surveys of presidential scholars   Taft is usually ranked near the middle of lists of all American Presidents   After leaving office  Taft spent his time in academia  arbitration  and the pursuit of world peace through his self founded League to Enforce Peace   In 1921  President Warren G  Harding appointed Taft Chief Justice of the United States  He emphasized conservative policies and efficient management     William Howard Taft was born into the powerful Taft family on September 15  1857  near Cincinnati  Ohio  the son of Louisa Torrey and Alphonso Taft     His paternal grandfather was Peter Rawson Taft   a descendant of Robert Taft I   the first Taft in America  who settled in Colonial Mendon in a section known later as Uxbridge   Massachusetts  Alphonso Taft went to Cincinnati in 1839 to open a law practice    and was a prominent Republican who served as Secretary of War and Attorney General under President Ulysses S  Grant      Young William attended Cincinnati s First Congregational Unitarian Church with his parents  he joined the congregation at an early age and was an enthusiastic participant  As he rose in the government  he spent little time in Cincinnati  He attended the church much less frequently than he had but worshiped there when he could     Taft attended Woodward High School in Cincinnati  and laid the cornerstone of the new Woodward High School  now the site of the School for Creative and Performing Arts  SCPA     Like others in his family  he attended Yale College in New Haven  Connecticut    At Yale  he was a member of the Linonian Society   a literary and debating society  Skull and Bones   the secret society co founded by his father  Alphonso Taft   in 1832  and the Beta chapter of the Psi Upsilon fraternity  He was given the nickname  Big Lub  because of his size    but his college friends knew him by the nickname  Old Bill     While Taft s weight sometimes made him the target of jokes barbed comments  he usually took them with grace and made self deprecating jokes  Despite his size  he was a good dancer and a better than average athlete who enjoyed golf  tennis and horseback riding    Making positive use of his stature  Taft was Yale s intramural heavyweight wrestling champion    In 1878  Taft graduated  ranking second in his class out of 121    After college  he attended Cincinnati Law School   graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1880  While in law school  he worked on the area newspaper The Cincinnati Commercial      After admission to the Ohio bar   Taft was appointed Assistant Prosecutor of Hamilton County  Ohio     based in Cincinnati  In 1882  he was appointed local Collector of Internal Revenue     Taft married his longtime sweetheart  Helen Herron   in Cincinnati in 1886    In 1887  he was appointed a judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati    In 1890  President Benjamin Harrison appointed him Solicitor General of the United States    at age 32  he was the youngest ever Solicitor General    Taft then began serving on the newly created United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 1891    he was confirmed by the Senate on March 17  1892  and received his commission that same day    In about 1893  Taft decided in favor of the processing aluminum patents belonging to the Pittsburgh Reduction Company  now known as Alcoa     Along with his judgeship  between 1896 and 1900 Taft also served as the first dean and a professor of constitutional law at the University of Cincinnati      In 1900  President William McKinley appointed Taft chairman of a commission to organize a civilian government in the Philippines which had been ceded to the United States by Spain following the SpanishAmerican War and the 1898 Treaty of Paris     Although Taft had been opposed to the annexation of the islands  and had told McKinley his real ambition was to become a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States  he reluctantly accepted the appointment       From 1901 to 1904  Taft served as the first civilian Governor General of the Philippines   a position in which he was very popular with both Americans and Filipinos     In 1902  Taft visited Rome to negotiate with Pope Leo XIII for the purchase of Philippine lands owned by the Roman Catholic Church  Taft then persuaded Congress to appropriate more than  7million to purchase these lands  which he sold to Filipinos on easy terms    In 1903  President Theodore Roosevelt offered Taft the seat on the Supreme Court to which he had for so long aspired  but he reluctantly declined since he viewed the Filipinos as not yet being capable of governing themselves and because of his popularity among them    This decision was one among many in Taft s career which demonstrated a compulsive dedication to the job at hand  without regard to his self interest   Roosevelt actually made the offer of a seat on the Court on several different occasions  being met with a decline every time      This dedication to the task at hand was the source of much frustration of his political colleagues    According to biographer Anderson  contrary to the belief of Roosevelt and other allies  Taft s role as Governor General in the Philippines did not serve to equip him with the political skills essential for the White House     In 1904  Roosevelt appointed Taft as Secretary of War    This appointment allowed Taft to remain involved in the Philippines and Roosevelt also assured Taft he would support his later appointment to the Court  while Taft agreed to support Roosevelt in the Presidential election of 1904    Roosevelt made the basic policy decisions regarding military affairs  using Taft as a well traveled spokesman who campaigned for Roosevelt s reelection in 1904  Of Taft s appointment  Roosevelt said   If only there were three of you  I could appoint one of you to the Court  one to the War Department and one to the Philippines     Taft met with the Emperor of Japan who alerted him of the probability of war with Russia   In 1905  Taft met with Japanese Prime Minister Katsura Tar    At that meeting  the two signed a secret diplomatic memorandum now called the TaftKatsura Agreement   Contrary to rumor  the memorandum did not establish any new policies but instead repeated the public positions of both nations     On September 29  1906  Secretary Taft initiated the Second Occupation of Cuba when he established the Provisional Government of Cuba under the terms of the CubanAmerican Treaty of Relations of 1903  the Platt Amendment   declaring himself Provisional Governor of Cuba      The US sent troops to restore order in Cuba during the revolt led by General Enrique Loynaz del Castillo  and Taft temporarily became the Civil Governor of Cuba   personally negotiating with Castillo for a peaceful end to the revolt  On October 13  Taft was succeeded as Provisional Governor by Charles Edward Magoon   On October 23  President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 518   ratifying the order and ordering Magoon to report to Taft through the Bureau of Insular Affairs      Also in that year Roosevelt made his third offer to Taft of a position on the Court which he again declined out of a sense of duty to resolve pending issues in the Philippines  Had it been for the Chief Justice seat  a different result may well have ensued    Taft indicated to Roosevelt he wanted to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court  not President  but there was no vacancy and Roosevelt had other plans  in 1907 he began touting Taft as the best choice for the Presidential nomination by the party    Taft s wife was determined to gain the White House and pressured him not to accept a court appointment  other family members also strongly favored the Presidency for him  He gave Taft more responsibilities along with the Philippines and the Panama Canal  For a while  Taft was Acting Secretary of State   When Roosevelt was away  Taft was  in effect  the Acting President   While serving as the War Secretary Taft generally concentrated on major developments  including the Philippines and the Panama Canal  to the detriment of departmental housekeeping problems  including factionalism within the Department  of which Roosevelt was aware    In 1903 the HayBunau Varilla Treaty granted the U S  construction rights for the Panama Canal   which Roosevelt delegated to the War Department  and Taft thereby supervised the beginning of construction on the Canal    Taft promoted a reduction in the tariffs on sugar and tobacco in the Philippines  a position with which Roosevelt disagreed  Taft offered to resign but this was refused by Roosevelt    Taft also had a disagreement with Roosevelt over the latter s conclusion of an executive agreement with the Dominican Republic  in lieu of what Taft thought should have been a treaty  requiring ratification by the Senate  Roosevelt dismissed the complaint as  trifling   and Taft  in his usual style  let it go     Theodore Roosevelt had become president after William McKinley was assassinated in 1901  After getting elected president in his own right in 1904  on election night on the lawn of the White House  Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for reelection in 1908   a decision that he immediately regretted  But he felt bound by his word  Taft was the logical successor  but he was initially reluctant to run  as he had been earlier  As a member of Roosevelt s cabinet  he had declared that his future ambition was to serve on the Supreme Court  not the White House  Taft s efforts in stumping for the party in the 1906 mid term elections made him aware of his deficiencies as an effective campaigner  Mrs  Taft even commented during this time   never did he cease to regard a Supreme Court appointment as more desirable than the presidency     But Taft conceded  with his extensive involvement as the most prominent member of the cabinet  that he was the most  available  man    thus he agreed that were he to be nominated for president  he would put his personal convictions aside and run a vigorous campaign     At the time  Roosevelt was convinced that Taft was a genuine   progressive   and helped push through the nomination of his Secretary of War onto the Republican ticket on the first ballot at the party convention    His opponent in the general election was William Jennings Bryan   who had already run for president twice before  in 1896 and in 1900 against William McKinley   During the campaign  Taft undercut Bryan s liberal support by accepting some of his reformist ideas  and Roosevelt s progressive policies blurred the distinctions between the parties  Bryan  on the other hand  ran an aggressive campaign against the nation s business elite  The Democrats referred to Taft s nomination and potential election  pre determined by the powerful Roosevelt  as a possible  forced succession to the presidency    It did not take long for Taft s markedly different style  and lack of political acumen  to emerge  Joseph B  Foraker of Ohio  seeking Taft s support in his senatorial re election  made an appearance with Taft  creating the impression Taft was allied with the big business trusts  And when Taft failed to follow the Hearst papers in denouncing Foraker s association with them  Roosevelt became incensed    Taft also showed his political ineptness by choosing Frank Hitchcock to be Chairman of the Republican Party  Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business  which further alienated the progressive wing of the party    Despite the difference in styles  Taft had demonstrated for the most part that the substance of his policies echoed those of Roosevelt    In the end  Taft won by a comfortable electoral margin  giving Bryan his worst loss in three presidential campaigns  Taft defeated Bryan by 159 electoral votes  however  he garnered just 51  of the popular vote    Mrs  Taft was quoted quite prophetically  saying that   There was nothing to criticize  except his not knowing or caring about the way the game of politics is played      Taft did not enjoy the easy relationship with the press that Roosevelt had  choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as the previous president had done    When a reporter informed him he was no Teddy Roosevelt  Taft replied that his main goal was to  try to accomplish just as much without any noise     Taft even made executive decisions  see below  demonstrating his indifference with the press  Indeed  Taft s administration marked a change in style from the political charisma of Roosevelt to the passion of Taft for the rule of law    Taft  in fashioning his cabinet  showed also that he was not unwilling to depart to some degree from Roosevelt s progressivism  he named an anti progressive  Philander Chase Knox Secretary of State  who had primary influence over other appointments     Taft considered himself a progressive  in part from his belief in an expansive use of the rule of law  as the prevailing device that should be actively used by judges and others in authority to solve society s  and even the world s  problems  But his devotion to the law also often made Taft a slave to precedent  and less adroit in politics than Roosevelt  he therefore lacked the flexibility  creativity and personal magnetism of his mentor  not to mention the publicity devices  the dedicated supporters  and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable       The divergent views of the two men over the powers of the executive is well articulated in their respective memoirs  In summary  Roosevelt for his part believed  the President has not just a right but a duty to do anything demanded by the needs of the nation  unless such action is forbidden by the Constitution or federal law   Taft s general opinion on the other hand was that  the President can exercise no power which cannot fairly be traced to some specific grant of power in the Constitution or act of Congress      Keller argues that  Taft in his way was a Progressive president  surpassing TR in antitrust suits and subscribing to an administrative more than political model of the presidency     Taft  however  increasingly came to blows with the Progressive faction of the GOP  which looked to Roosevelt or LaFollette for leadership  Taft thus increasingly depended on the conservative faction of his party   When President Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would divide the Republican Party  he assumed a low profile on that issue  Taft ignored the political dynamite and kept the tariff rates on his agenda  he had raised expectations of lower rates in the campaign   he passively encouraged congressional reformers to draft bills including lower rates  while broadcasting a willingness to compromise with conservative leaders in the Congress  who wanted to keep tariff rates high  Taft described this approach as his  policy of harmony  with the Congress    The President displayed a more aggressive role early in the drafting of tariff legislation as it regarded the Philippines  He also assumed a similar role in pushing for a corporate income tax  On other matters  he was content to wait until legislation reached its final stage in a joint HouseSenate conference committee  Once there  however  he jumped in with both feet  calling each and every member of the committee for a one on one meeting at the White House    The resulting tariff rates in the PayneAldrich Tariff Act of 1909 were too high for the progressives  based in part on Taft s campaign promises  but instead of blaming the act s shortcomings on Senator Nelson W  Aldrich and big business  Taft claimed the responsibility  calling it the best bill to come from the Republican Party  Again  due to his results oriented style  politically he had managed to alienate all sides    The Bureau of Trade Relations later concluded the act overall was moderately successful in lowering rates    Congress refused however to fund the Tariff Board which the President included in the PayneAldrich Bill  which would have removed the setting of rates from direct continual Congressional manipulation     Taft was less likely to speak critically of big business than Roosevelt  Nevertheless  his rule of law orientation resulted in the filing of 90 antitrust suits during his administration  compared to 54 such suits by Roosevelt s two term Justice Department  Taft s efforts included one suit against the country s largest corporation  U S  Steel   for the acquisition of a Tennessee company during Roosevelt s tenure    The lawsuit even named Roosevelt personally without Taft s knowledge  This was responsible for a complete break with Roosevelt    Progressives within the Republican Party began to actively oppose Taft  Senator Robert LaFollette of Wisconsin created the National Progressive Republican League to replace Taft on the national level  although  his campaign crashed after a disastrous speech  Most of LaFollette s supporters went over to Roosevelt  The business community and the conservative wing of the party were also alienated from Taft and contributions to the GOP dried up     Taft s administration got a political boost after 25 western railroads announced an intent to raise rates by 20   and Taft responded  first with a threat to enforce the Sherman Antitrust Act against them  he then negotiated a settlement whereby they agreed to submit delayed rate requests to a new Interstate Commerce Commission having authority over rate requests     In late 1911  President Taft called for a central organization in touch with associations and chambers of commerce throughout the country  Just four months later  on April 22  1912  Taft created the United States Chamber of Commerce as a counterbalance to the rise of the labor movement at the time     Taft s obsession with the law over politics created more trouble for him in the well noted dispute between his Interior Secretary  Richard Achilles Ballinger   and the Chief of the Forestry Service  Gifford Pinchot   Ballinger s job was to assure the proper legal form of land withdrawals made from the private sector as part of Roosevelt s conservation policy  Ballinger s review in many instances concluded that the legalities were lacking and lands had to be returned to private owners  Pinchot led the objections to these returns  and even convinced an Interior Department subordinate  Louis Glavis   to bring an accusation against Ballinger for fraud and collusion with corporate timber interests  Taft refused to intervene until the resulting discord in the cabinet forced him to act  The President reviewed the matter  then fired Glavis and Pinchot  Ballinger also tendered his resignation  which would have further served to end the matter were it not for Taft s refusal to accept it  By that time the political damage had been done  with further alienation of the Progressives from the administration   Taft  ever reluctant to dismiss cabinet members  nevertheless used the resignations of Ballinger and War Secretary Dickinson to modify the complexion of the cabinet by appointing more progressive Republicans  Walter L  Fisher   from the National Conservation League and an ally of Pinchot  replaced Ballinger  Henry L  Stimson   another progressive  replaced Dickinson    Taft s overriding concern in making most appointments  however  was ability and experience  not party or faction alignment  This was particularly the case with respect to judiciary appointments  specifically in the south  where Taft felt the courts were the weakest    Taft s high standards  which reduced the influence of Senatorial courtesy in the selection process  resulted in the placement of over one hundred well qualified federal judges    citation needed   Nevertheless  in the process Taft passed up yet another opportunity to embolden himself politically through the use of patronage     In the area of federal spending  Taft initiated reforms which would revolutionize the Executive s role in the federal government s budget process  Previously  each executive department presented to the Treasury Dept  its own expense estimates  which were then forwarded to the Congress  Taft ordered each department to begin submitting its requests to the cabinet for review  The first such round of requests and cabinet reviews resulted in a reduction of  92 million  representing the first actual presidential budget in modern history    Taft then requested  and received  approval and funding to create the Commission on Economy and Efficiency to study the budgeting process  The study recommended the President be required early in the Congressional session to present the legislature with a comprehensive budget  This recommendation ultimately became law with passage of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921     Taft s  policy of harmony  with Congress facilitated passage of most of his legislative program  Nevertheless  in the 1910 midterm elections  the Democrats assumed control of the House for the first time in 16 years  At the same time  in the Senate  while the Republicans retained their majority  they lost 8 seats     To solve an impasse during the 1909 tariff debate  Taft proposed income taxes for corporations and a constitutional amendment to remove the apportionment requirement for taxes on incomes from property  taxes on dividends  interest  and rents   on June 16  1909    His proposed tax on corporate net income was 1  on net profits over  5 000  It was designated an excise on the privilege of doing business as a corporation whose stockholders enjoyed the privilege of limited liability   and not a tax on incomes as such  In 1911  the Supreme Court  in Flint v  Stone Tracy Co    upheld the tax  Receipts grew from  21million in the fiscal year 1910 to  34 8million in 1912   In July 1909  a proposed amendment to allow the federal government to tax incomes was passed unanimously in the Senate and by a vote of 318 to 14 in the House  It was quickly ratified by the states  and on February 3  1913  it became a part of the Constitution as the Sixteenth Amendment    Taft announced in his inaugural address his intention of refusing to appoint African Americans to offices where this would cause race friction  Termed his  Southern Policy   this stance effectively invited white protests wherever blacks were to be  or had already been appointed  Taft made good on his stated intention and removed most black office holders in the South and made only token appointments in the North    Taft was  however  the first president to hire African Americans security guards in the White House     Taft met with Booker T  Washington and publicly endorsed his program for the uplifting of black Americans  He advised them to stay out of politics at the time and emphasize education and entrepreneurship  A supporter of free immigration  Taft vetoed a law passed by Congress and supported by labor unions that would have restricted unskilled laborers by imposing a literacy test     The President surprised the diplomatic arena with his early dismissal of one of the State Department s most experienced diplomats  Henry White   the Ambassador to France  The only suspected reason for this decision was that White was thought to have somehow slighted the President and his wife 25 years earlier on their honeymoon in Europe  Taft was oblivious to the serious damage that this decision caused his political reputation     The following year White accepted Taft s appointment to head a delegation to the Pan American Conference in Buenos Aires    The President made it a top priority to reorganize the State Department  saying   It is organized on the basis of the needs of the government in 1800 instead of 1900     The Department was for the first time organized into geographical divisions  including the Far East  the Near East  Latin America and Western Europe  This reorganization was engineered in large part by Secretary of State Knox s First Assistant Secretary  Huntington Wilson  who served as de facto Secretary of State due to the frequent absence of Knox  Again displaying his inept administrative leadership  Taft  while not sharing any of Knox s respect for Wilson s ability  deferred to much of Wilson s policy making     The President personally engaged in talks with the Chinese to provide American assistance in the expansion of the Chinese railroad industry  this was accomplished through participation in the multi national Hukuang Loan  The effort was dubbed  shirt sleeves diplomacy     Initial success in China led to an extended effort by the President to effect the Open Door Policy  particularly in Manchuria  this was not successful due in large part to the President s reliance on the inexperienced Knox  who failed to properly assess the objections of Japan and Russia     Taft actively promoted the nation s role in the economic development of Latin America  specifically through the Honduras and Nicaragua conventions  The concept  referred to as   Dollar Diplomacy    called for the State Department to coordinate loans to the countries for infrastructure improvement from the largest banks in the U S  Strategically  this was designed to strengthen security for the Panama Canal  increase American trade  and diminish the presence of European nations in the area  Progressives and Insurgent Republicans in the Senate opposed the Wall Street connection  so the effort was largely a failure    The President was more successful in Argentina  where agreements were reached whereby the U S  provided loans to enable Argentina to acquire battleships  some naval construction and design secrets were sacrificed in the arrangement     Another of Taft s goals was the furtherance of world peace  He believed that international arbitration between adversarial nations could be utilized as the best means to avoid armed conflict  This was a logical extension of his boundless faith in the rule of law as a Progressive  and it therefore even superseded U S nationalism as embodied in the Constitution  Hence  he found no objection to surrendering to an international body jurisdiction over the nation s rights in international affairs  As a result  he championed arbitration treaties with Britain and France    The Senate was not prepared to make such a surrender of the nation s interests  and approved the treaties but only with modifications that provided the Senate with a veto over any decisions made in arbitration     In the 1911 Congressional session Taft s most potentially notable achievement was approval of a reciprocity agreement with Canada which proposed to drastically lower trade barriers  The passage was accomplished with the cooperation of some Democrats  and at a considerable cost of Republican unity    The President confessed to Roosevelt  I think it may break the Republican party for a while   Taft also responded to criticism from party leaders  saying   I do not give a tinker s dam whether it injures my political prospects or not     Despite the potential benefits of the agreement to the country  which Roosevelt as well understood and anticipated  all was for naught when the Canadian legislature refused to approve it     In 1909  Taft and Porfirio Daz planned a summit in El Paso  Texas  and Ciudad Jurez  Mexico  an historic first meeting between a U S  president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico    Diaz requested the meeting to show U S  support for his planned eighth run as president  and Taft agreed to support Diaz in order to protect the several billion dollars of American capital then invested in Mexico    Both sides agreed that the disputed Chamizal strip connecting El Paso to Ciudad Jurez would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit  but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted in assassination threats and other serious security concerns    The Texas Rangers   4 000 U S  and Mexican troops  U S  Secret Service agents  FBI agents and U S  marshals were all called in to provide security    An additional 250 person private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham   the celebrated scout  was hired by John Hays Hammond   a close friend of Taft from Yale and a former candidate for U S  Vice President in 1908 who  along with his business partner Burnham  held considerable mining interests in Mexico        On October 16  the day of the summit  Burnham and Private C R  Moore  a Texas Ranger  discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route    Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the would be assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Daz     No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft s statesmanship and commitment to peace more than the subsequent uprising in Mexico against the authoritarian regime of the aging Daz  which had attracted billions in capital investment for economic development  much of it from the U S    Anti regime  and anti American  riots began in 1910 and were reported by Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson to Knox  who failed to pass the information on to the President  Some months later Wilson met with Taft  Knox was out of town on vacation   and upon hearing the information  the President immediately and unilaterally ordered a mobilization of 25 000 troops to the Mexican border as well as naval maneuvers in the Gulf of Mexico  Taft publicly directed that no intervention of troops into Mexico was to occur without Congressional authorization    The President s restraint in the name of peace was difficult to maintain  in Arizona two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured as a result of the uprising  but Taft would not be goaded into fighting and so instructed the Arizona governor     The results of the 1910 elections made it clear to the President that Roosevelt had departed his camp  and that he might even contend for the party nomination in 1912    On his return from Europe  Roosevelt openly broke with Taft in one of the notable political feuds of the 20th century  To the surprise of observers who thought Roosevelt had unstoppable momentum  Taft determined he would not simply step aside for the popular ex President  despite the diminished support he had in the party  Taft acknowledged this  saying   the longer I am President  the less of a party man I seem to become     Roosevelt declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in February 1912  Taft soon decided that he would focus on canvassing for delegates and not attempt at the outset to take on the more able campaigner one on one    As Roosevelt became more radical in his progressivism  Taft was hardened in his resolve to achieve re nomination  as he was convinced that the Progressives threatened the very foundation of the government    Taft ultimately outmaneuvered Roosevelt and Senator Robert M  La Follette Sr  in delegate count  regained control of the GOP convention  and defeated Roosevelt for the nomination     Roosevelt and his group of disgruntled party delegates and members bolted from the party to create the Progressive Party  or  Bull Moose   ticket  splitting the Republican vote in the 1912 election    Taft thought that  despite probable defeat  the party had been preserved as  the defender of conservative government and conservative institutions   He also felt that the expected defeat would remind the party of the need for self discipline in the face of populist rancor    Woodrow Wilson   the Democrat  was elected with 41  of the popular vote  Roosevelt got 27   and Taft garnered 23   Taft won a mere eight electoral votes  in Utah and Vermont   making it the worst defeat in American history of an incumbent President seeking reelection     The defeated President had long ago acknowledged his weakness as a campaigner and as well his failure to do the necessary political housekeeping when decisions were made  He also refused to recognize the need to publicize his policies and decisions  saying  After I have made a definite statement  I have to let it go at that until the time for action arises     Taft s indifference towards the press even extended to legislation  where he failed to recognize the press  need for reduced tariffs on print paper and wood pulp    He further alienated the press when recommending that a deficit in the post office be reduced by eliminating the lower second class rates afforded to magazines and newspapers    Taft commented as follows on the state of his party after the election      it behooves the Republicans to gather again to the party standard and pledge anew their faith in their party s principles and to organize again to defend the constitutional government handed down to us by our fathers  Without compromising our principles  we must convince and win back former Republicans  and we must reinforce our ranks with Constitution loving Democrats      In spite of his failure to be re elected  Taft achieved what he felt were his main goals as President  keeping permanent control of the party and keeping the courts sacrosanct until they were next threatened   While the strife during the election of 1912 devastated the once very close friendship between Taft and Theodore Roosevelt  the two eventually did reconcile not long before Roosevelt s death in 1919     Taft appointed the following justices to the Supreme Court of the United States    Taft s six appointments to the Court rank below only those of George Washington  who appointed all six justices to the first Court   and of Franklin D  Roosevelt  who was president for just over twelve years  and equals that of Andrew Jackson   Taft s appointment of five new justices tied the number appointed by both Dwight D  Eisenhower and Abraham Lincoln   Four of Taft s appointees were relatively young  aged 48  51  53  and 54   The appointments of Edward Douglass White and Charles Evans Hughes also are notable because Taft essentially appointed both his predecessor and successor Chief Justices  respectively  Already on the Court as an associate justice since 1894  White was the first Chief Justice to be elevated from an associate justiceship since President George Washington appointed John Rutledge to Chief Justice in 1795  Hughes initially was appointed an Associate Justice   but later resigned to run as the Republican Party s presidential candidate in the 1916 election   which he would lose  President Herbert Hoover renominated Hughes to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice following Taft s retirement   Besides his Supreme Court appointments  Taft appointed 13 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 38 judges to the United States district courts   Taft also appointed judges to various specialty courts  including the first five appointees each to the United States Commerce Court and the United States Court of Customs Appeals   The Commerce Court was abolished in 1913  Taft was thus the only President to appoint judges to that body   Upon leaving the White House in 1913  Taft was appointed the Chancellor Kent Professor of Law and Legal History at Yale Law School     While at Yale  Taft was initiated as an honorary member of the Acacia Fraternity   At the same time  Taft was elected president of the American Bar Association   He spent much of his time writing newspaper articles and books  most notably his series on American legal philosophy   He was a vigorous opponent of prohibition in the United States   predicting the undesirable situation that the Eighteenth Amendment would create    He also continued to advocate world peace through international arbitration  urging nations to enter into arbitration treaties with each other and promoting the idea of a League of Nations even before the First World War began  Taft was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1914    Additionally  he lectured on Legal Ethics at Boston University from 1918 to 1921     When World War I did break out in Europe in 1914  however  Taft founded the League to Enforce Peace   He was a co chairman of the powerful National War Labor Board between 1917 and 1918   Taft also supported the war effort by joining the Connecticut Home Guard   an organization formed to perform many of the in state duties of the National Guard while the National Guard was deployed overseas       Although he continually advocated peace  he strongly favored conscription once the United States entered the War  pleading publicly that the United States not fight a  finicky  war  He feared the war would be long  but was for fighting it out to a finish  given what he viewed as  Germany s brutality    On June 30  1921  following the death of Chief Justice Edward Douglass White  whom Taft himself had nominated   President Warren G  Harding nominated Taft to take his place  For a man who had once remarked   there is nothing I would have loved more than being chief justice of the United States  the nomination to oversee the highest court in the land was like a dream come true    There was little opposition to the nomination  and the Senate approved him 60 4 in a secret session on the day of his nomination  but the roll call of the vote has never been made public    Taft received his commission immediately and readily took up the position  taking the oath of office on July 11  and serving until 1930  As such  he became the only President to serve as Chief Justice  and thus the only former President to swear in subsequent Presidents  giving the oath of office to both Calvin Coolidge  in 1925  and Herbert Hoover  in 1929    Taft enjoyed his years on the court and was respected by his peers  Justice Felix Frankfurter once remarked to Justice Louis Brandeis that it was  difficult for me to understand why a man who is so good a Chief Justice   could have been so bad as President     Taft remains the only person to have led both the Executive and Judicial branches of the United States government   He considered his time as Chief Justice to be the highest point of his career  allegedly  he once remarked  I do not remember that I was ever President      In 1922  Taft traveled to England to study the procedural structure of the English courts and to learn how they dropped such a large number of cases quickly  During the trip  King George V and Queen Mary received Taft and his wife as state visitors   With what he had learned in England  Taft decided to advocate the introduction and passage of the Judiciary Act of 1925   which shifts the Supreme Court s appellate jurisdiction to be largely discretionary upon review of litigants  petitioning to be granted an appeal  see also writ of certiorari    This allowed the Supreme Court to give preference to what they believed to be cases of national importance and allowed the Court to work more efficiently   Besides giving the Supreme Court more control over its docket  supporting new legislation  and organizing the Judicial Conference  Taft gave the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice general supervisory power over the scattered and disorganized federal courts   The legislation also brought the courts of the District of Columbia and of the Territories  and soon  the Commonwealths of the Philippines and Puerto Rico   into the federal court system  This united the courts for the first time as an independent third branch of government under the administrative supervision of the Chief Justice  Taft was also the first Justice to employ two full time law clerks to assist him   In 1929  Taft successfully argued in favor of the construction of a separate and spacious Supreme Court building   reasoning that the Supreme Court needed to distance itself from the Congress as a separate branch of the federal government  Until then  the Court had heard cases in the Old Senate Chamber of the Capitol   the Justices had no private chambers there  and their conferences were held in a room in the Capitol s basement  The building was completed in 1935  five years after Taft s death  and remains the seat of the Supreme Court to this day   While Chief Justice  Taft wrote the opinion for the Court in 256 cases out of the Court s ever growing caseload  His philosophy of constitutional interpretation was essentially historical contextualism   Some of his more notable opinions include   Taft is often remembered as being the most obese president    He was 5feet 11inches  1 80m  tall  his weight peaked at 335340 pounds  150kg  toward the end of his Presidency    The truth of the story of Taft getting stuck in a White House bathtub is unclear  However  he once did overflow a bathtub       Evidence from eyewitnesses   and from Taft himself  strongly suggests that during his presidency he had severe obstructive sleep apnea     His chief symptom was somnolence   While President  he fell asleep during conversations  and at the dinner table  and even while standing  He was also strikingly hypertensive  with a systolic blood pressure over 200     Within a year of leaving the presidency  Taft lost approximately 80 pounds  36kg   His somnolence problem resolved and  less obviously  his systolic blood pressure dropped 4050 mmHg  from 210 mmHg   Undoubtedly  this weight loss extended his life     Soon after his weight loss  he had a revival of interest in the outdoors  this led him to explore Alaska    Beginning in 1920  Taft used a cane  this was a gift from Professor of Geology W  S  Foster  and was made of 250 000 year old petrified wood      After several heart attacks in 1924  Taft was slowing down  He wrote in 1925 that his memory was becoming poorer and in 1928   my mind does not work as well as it did  and I scatter     When he administered the Oath of Office to President Hoover on March 4  1929  he recited part of the oath incorrectly  later writing in a personal letter       my memory is not always accurate and one sometimes becomes a little uncertain    misquoting again in that letter  but differently     Taft began experiencing hallucinations as 1930 began  On February 3  he stepped down from the Supreme Court  Charles Evans Hughes   whom he had appointed as an Associate Justice while President  succeeded him as Chief Justice  An official statement by his doctors announced that he had suffered from heart disease and atherosclerosis for years  but that he had no other serious ailments   Five weeks following his retirement  some of which was spent in a state of semi consciousness  Taft died on March 8  1930  from cardiovascular disease  and the same date as Associate Justice Edward Terry Sanford  s unexpected death  As it was customary for members of the court to attend the funeral of deceased members  this posed a  logistical nightmare   necessitating traveling immediately from Knoxville  Tennessee   for Sanford s funeral to Washington for Taft s funeral      The house at which Taft died is now the diplomatic mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United States     Three days following his death  on March 11  he became the first president and first Chief Justice to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery       James Earle Fraser sculpted his grave marker out of Stony Creek granite    Taft is one of two presidents buried at Arlington National Cemetery  the other is John F  Kennedy    and is one of four Chief Justices buried there   Earl Warren   Warren E  Burger   and William Rehnquist are the others   As a former president  Taft was the only Chief Justice to have had a state funeral    In 1938  a third generation of the Taft family entered the national political stage with the election of the former President s oldest son Robert A  Taft I to the Senate  where he became a leader of the conservative Republicans  President Taft s other son  Charles Phelps Taft II   served as the mayor of Cincinnati from 1955 to 1957   President Taft s enduring legacy includes many things named after him  The William Howard Taft National Historic Site is the Taft boyhood home  The house in which he was born has been restored to its original appearance  It includes four period rooms reflecting family life during Taft s boyhood  and second floor exhibits highlighting Taft s life    Others include the courthouse of the Ohio Court of Appeals for the First District in Cincinnati  streets in Cincinnati  Arlington  Virginia   and Taft Avenue in Manila   Philippines  the Taft Bridge in Washington  D C    a law school in Santa Ana  California     and high schools in San Antonio   Texas  Woodland Hills   California  Chicago  Illinois  and The Bronx   Taft  Eastern Samar   a town in the Philippines was named after him  After a fire burned much of the town of Moron   California  in the 1920s  it was renamed Taft  California  in his honor   George Burroughs Torrey painted a portrait of him  Taft is the last President to have sported facial hair while in office     ", "Coolidge": "Birth and family history Early career and marriage Education and

lawyer from Vermont   Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics   eventually becoming governor of that state  His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action  Soon after  he was elected as the 29th Vice President in 1920 and succeeded to the Presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G  Harding in 1923  Elected in his own right in 1924   he gained a reputation as a small government conservative   and also as a man who said very little  although having a fair sense of humor   Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor s administration  and left office with considerable popularity    As a Coolidge biographer put it   He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class   could interpret their longings and express their opinions  That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength     Coolidge s retirement was relatively short  dying at the age of 60 in 1933  less than two months before his direct successor  Herbert Hoover   left office  He was the fourth of five presidents to have died during the term of their direct successor  Some later criticized Coolidge as part of a general disapproval of laissez faire government    His reputation underwent a renaissance during the Ronald Reagan administration  but the ultimate assessment of his presidency is still divided between those who approve of his reduction of the size of government programs and those who believe the federal government should be more involved in regulating and controlling the economy       John Calvin Coolidge Jr   was born in Plymouth Notch   Windsor County   Vermont   on July 4  1872  the only U S  President to be born on Independence Day   He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge Sr   18451926  and Victoria Josephine Moor  184685   Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations  but developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer  storekeeper and public servant  He held various local offices  including justice of the peace and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate    Coolidge s mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer  She was chronically ill and died  perhaps from tuberculosis   when Coolidge was twelve years old  His younger sister  Abigail Grace Coolidge  18751890   died at the age of fifteen  probably of appendicitis  when Coolidge was eighteen  Coolidge s father remarried in 1891  to a schoolteacher  and lived to the age of eighty     Coolidge s family had deep roots in New England   his earliest American ancestor  John Coolidge  emigrated from Cottenham   Cambridgeshire  England  around 1630 and settled in Watertown  Massachusetts     Another ancestor  Edmund Rice   arrived at Watertown in 1638  Coolidge s great great grandfather  also named John Coolidge  was an American military officer in the Revolutionary War and one of the first selectmen of the town of Plymouth Notch    His grandfather  Calvin Galusha Coolidge   served in the Vermont House of Representatives    Most of Coolidge s ancestors were farmers   Other prominent Coolidges  architect Charles Allerton Coolidge   General Charles Austin Coolidge   and diplomat Archibald Cary Coolidge among them  were descended from branches of the family that had remained in Massachusetts    Fellow Massachusetts politicians  U S  Senator Marcus A  Coolidge and Lieutenant Governor Arthur W  Coolidge   were also distant relatives  Coolidge s grandmother Sarah Almeda Brewer had two famous first cousins  Arthur Brown   a United States Senator from Utah   and Olympia Brown   a women s suffragist  It is through Sarah Brewer that Coolidge indeterminably believed that he inherited American Indian ancestry     Coolidge attended Black River Academy and then Amherst College   where he distinguished himself in the debating class  as a senior joined the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta and graduated cum laude   While there  Coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor Charles E  Garman  a Congregational mystic  with a neo Hegelian philosophy  Garman ignited in Coolidge a manly self respect  and inspired him with a belief in God as a cosmic conscious  greater than the human  which represented  the way  the truth and the life   Coolidge devotedly articulated Garman s ethics forty years later      there is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right  that the end does not justify the means  and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail  The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give  Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry  What they earn is theirs  no matter how small or how great  But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service        At his father s urging after graduation  Coolidge moved to Northampton  Massachusetts to become a lawyer  To avoid the cost of law school   Coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm  Hammond   Field  and reading law with them  John C  Hammond and Henry P  Field  both Amherst graduates  introduced Coolidge to law practice in the county seat of Hampshire County   In 1897  Coolidge was admitted to the bar  becoming a country lawyer     With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather  Coolidge was able to open his own law office in Northampton in 1898  He practiced commercial law  believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court  As his reputation as a hard working and diligent attorney grew  local banks and other businesses began to retain his services     In 1905 Coolidge met Grace Anna Goodhue   a University of Vermont graduate and teacher at the Clarke School for the Deaf   they were in the same crowd boating  picnicking and dancing  the younger ones of the Congregational Church  That year they were engaged in early summer and married in October  after an attempt in vain by Grace s mother to postpone the vows  she was never enamored with him nor he with her  The newlyweds went on honeymoon to Montreal  originally planned for two weeks but cut short by a week at Coolidge s request  After 25 years he wrote of Grace      for almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities and I have rejoiced in her graces      Being consistently loyal  he was a devoted husband  but also could be self centered  undemonstrative and reserved  and often grumpy  and there was the ubiquitous mistress of politics  But Grace knew all of this when she married him  in addition to recognizing in him a man of solid character  She was amiable  tolerant and possessed of an understanding heart  She could mimic her husband s peculiarities and did so to the amusement of family and friends  but without mocking him meanly  She knew his great strengths and understood his minor weaknesses  Socially  she was as quick witted as he and of greater maturity  she supplemented his natural shyness with a graceful candor  and offset his occasional lapses into taciturnity with a gay loquacity that could keep a dinner table conversation going   Coolidge was quite frugal when it came to securing a home  They rented  Coolidge did not like to be beholden to bankers or anyone else  for that matter  Independence was his way of protecting his freedom to do what was right  The same impulse caused him to hesitate before joining clubs  Henry Field had a pew in Edwards Church  and Grace was a member  but Coolidge only went along  His decision infuriated his colleagues in politics  after all  the more clubs one joined  the more friends one had at election time  But Coolidge found another way to connect with fellow citizens  he deposited savings with a variety of institutions  Each additional banker who held some of his money was an additional pair of eyes that would follow him  and likely be an additional vote     The Coolidges had two sons  John  September 7  1906  May 31  2000  and Calvin  April 13  1908  July 7  1924   After Calvin died at age 16 from blood poisoning brought on by an infected blister    his death  hurt him terribly  according to son John    John became a railroad executive  helped to start the Coolidge Foundation  and was instrumental in creating the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site      The Republican Party was dominant in New England in Coolidge s time  and he followed Hammond s and Field s example by becoming active in local politics    In 1896 Coolidge campaigned for Republican presidential candidate William McKinley in 1896  and the next year he was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee    In 1898  he won election to the City Council of Northampton  placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected    The position offered no salary  but provided Coolidge invaluable political experience    In 1899  he declined renomination  running instead for City Solicitor   a position elected by the City Council  He was elected for a one year term in 1900  and reelected in 1901    This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer and paid a salary of  600    In 1902  the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor  and Coolidge returned to private practice    Soon thereafter  however  the clerk of courts for the county died  and Coolidge was chosen to replace him  The position paid well  but it barred him from practicing law  so he remained at the job for only one year    In 1904  Coolidge suffered his sole defeat at the ballot box  losing an election to the Northampton school board   When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern  Coolidge replied  Might give me time      In 1906  the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the state House of Representatives   He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat   and reported to Boston for the 1907 session of the Massachusetts General Court     In his freshman term  Coolidge served on minor committees and  although he usually voted with the party  was known as a Progressive Republican   voting in favor of such measures as women s suffrage and the direct election of Senators     While in Boston  Coolidge became an ally  and then a liegeman  of then U S  Senator Winthrop Murray Crane who controlled the western faction of the Massachusetts Republican Party  Crane s party rival in the east of the commonwealth was U S  Senator Henry Cabot Lodge     Another key strategic alliance which Coolidge forged was with Guy Currier  who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction  wealth  personal charm and broad circle of friends which Coolidge lacked  and which would have a lasting impact on his political career    In 1907  he was elected to a second term  and in the 1908 session  Coolidge was more outspoken  though not in a leadership position     Instead of vying for another term in the State House   Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for mayor of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired  He was well liked in the town  and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1 597 to 1 409    During his first term  1910 to 1911   he increased teachers  salaries and retired some of the city s debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease    He was renominated in 1911  and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin     In 1911  the State Senator for the Hampshire County area retired and successfully encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session  Coolidge defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin    At the start of that term  he became chairman of a committee to arbitrate the   Bread and Roses   strike by the workers of the American Woolen Company in Lawrence  Massachusetts     a   After two tense months  the company agreed to the workers  demands  in a settlement proposed by the committee    A major issue affecting Massachusetts Republicans that year was the party split between the progressive wing  which favored Theodore Roosevelt   and the conservative wing  which favored William Howard Taft   Although he favored some progressive measures  Coolidge refused to leave the Republican party    When the new Progressive Party declined to run a candidate in his state senate district  Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin     In the 1913 session Sen  Coolidge enjoyed renowned success in arduously navigating to passage the Western Trolley Act which connected Northampton with a dozen similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts    Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom  but when the President of the State Senate   Levi H  Greenwood   considered running for Lieutenant Governor  Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate in the hopes of being elected as its presiding officer    Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate  he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women s suffrage  Coolidge was in favor of the women s vote  won his own re election and with Crane s help  assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate    After his election in January 1914  Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled Have Faith in Massachusetts   which summarized his philosophy of government     Coolidge s speech was well received  and he attracted some admirers on its account    towards the end of the term  many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor  After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections  Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate    Coolidge s supporters  led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns   encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor    Stearns  an advertising executive  became another key ally  and began a publicity campaign on Coollidge s behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session     Coolidge entered the primary election for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate Samuel W  McCall   Coolidge was the leading vote getter in the Republican primary  and balanced the Republican ticket by adding a western presence to McCall s eastern base of support    McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election to their respective one year terms  with Coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50 000 votes     In Massachusetts  the lieutenant governor does not preside over the state Senate  as is the case in many other states  nevertheless  as lieutenant governor  Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor s council  He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee    As a full time elected official  Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916  though his family continued to live in Northampton    McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917  When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term  Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor     Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918  He and his running mate  Channing Cox   a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives   ran on the previous administration s record  fiscal conservatism   a vague opposition to Prohibition   support for women s suffrage  and support for American involvement in World War I     The issue of the war proved divisive  especially among Irish   and German Americans     Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16 773 votes over his opponent  Richard H  Long  in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns     In 1919  in reaction to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union   Police Commissioner Edwin U  Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated  In August of that year  the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union    Curtis declared the union s leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty  but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4    The mayor of Boston  Andrew Peters   convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days  but with no results  and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8    The following day  about three quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike      b   Coolidge  tacitly but fully in support of Curtis  position  closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities  He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle  that a policeman does not strike  That night and the next  there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city    Peters  concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others  called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority  and relieved Curtis of duty     Coolidge  sensing the severity of circumstances were then propitious to his intervention  conferred with Crane s operative  William Butler  and then acted    He called up more units of the National Guard  restored Curtis to office  and took personal control of the police force    Curtis proclaimed that all of the strikers were fired from their jobs  and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited    That night Coolidge received a telegram from AFL leader Samuel Gompers    Whatever disorder has occurred   Gompers wrote   is due to Curtis s order in which the right of the policemen has been denied    Coolidge publicly answered Gompers s telegram  denying any justification whatsoever for the strike  and his response launched him into the national consciousness  quoted  above left     Newspapers across the nation picked up on Coolidge s statement and he became the newest hero to opponents of the strike  In the midst of the First Red Scare   many Americans were terrified of the spread of communist revolution  like those that had taken place in Russia   Hungary   and Germany   While Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor  conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star    Although he usually acted with deliberation  the Boston police strike gave him a national reputation as a decisive leader    and as a strict enforcer of law and order     Coolidge and Cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919  By this time Coolidge s supporters  especially Stearns  had publicized his actions in the Police Strike around the state and the nation and some of Coolidge s speeches were published in book form    He faced the same opponent as in 1918  Richard Long  but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125 101 votes  more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier    c   His actions in the police strike  combined with the massive electoral victory  led to suggestions that Coolidge run for president in 1920     By the time Coolidge was inaugurated on January 2  1919  the First World War had ended  and Coolidge pushed the legislature to give a  100 bonus to Massachusetts veterans  He also signed a bill reducing the work week for women and children from fifty four hours to forty eight  saying   We must humanize the industry  or the system will break down     He signed into law a budget that kept the tax rates the same  while trimming  4 million from expenditures  thus allowing the state to retire some of its debt     Coolidge also wielded the veto pen as governor  His most publicized veto prevented an increase in legislators  pay by 50     Although Coolidge was personally opposed to Prohibition  he vetoed a bill in May 1920 that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of 2 75  alcohol or less   in Massachusetts in violation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution    Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution   he said in his veto message   Against it  they are void      At the 1920 Republican National Convention most of the delegates were selected by state party conventions  not primaries  As such  the field was divided among many local favorites    Coolidge was one such candidate  and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting  the powerful party bosses running the convention  primarily GOP U S  Senators  never considered him seriously    After ten ballots  the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G  Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president    When the time came to select a vice presidential nominee  the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted  Sen  Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin  and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth  relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision  A delegate from Oregon   Wallace McCamant   having read Have Faith in Massachusetts   proposed Coolidge for Vice President instead  The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses  and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated     The Democrats nominated another Ohioan  James M  Cox   for President and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy  Franklin D  Roosevelt   for Vice President  The question of the United States joining the League of Nations was a major issue in the campaign  as was the unfinished legacy of Progressivism     Harding ran a  front porch  campaign from his home in Marion  Ohio   but Coolidge took to the campaign trail in the Upper South   New York  and New England  his audiences carefully limited to those familiar with Coolidge and those placing a premium upon concise and short speeches    On November 2  1920  Harding and Coolidge were victorious in a landslide  winning more than 60 percent of the popular vote  including every state outside the South    They also won in Tennessee   the first time a Republican ticket had won a Southern state since Reconstruction      The U S  Vice Presidency did not carry many official duties  but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings  making him the first Vice President to do so    He gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country     As the U S  Vice President  Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace were invited to quite a few parties  where the legend of  Silent Cal  was born  It is from this time that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving Coolidge originate  Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker  in private he was a man of few words and was commonly referred to as  Silent Cal   A possibly apocryphal story has it a matron  seated next to him at a dinner  said to him   I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you   He replied   You lose     Dorothy Parker   upon learning that Coolidge had died  reportedly remarked   How can they tell     Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society  when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties  he replied   Got to eat somewhere     Alice Roosevelt Longworth   a leading Republican wit  underscored Coolidge s silence and his dour personality   When he wished he were elsewhere  he pursed his lips  folded his arms  and said nothing  He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle      As President  Coolidge s reputation as a quiet man continued   The words of a President have an enormous weight   he would later write   and ought not to be used indiscriminately     Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation  indeed  he cultivated it   I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President   he once told Ethel Barrymore    and I think I will go along with them     Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge s image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic    while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural  deepening after the death of his son in 1924     On August 2  1923  President Harding died suddenly while on a speaking tour of the western United States  Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his family home   which had neither electricity nor a telephone  when he received word by messenger of Harding s death    He dressed  said a prayer  and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled    His father  a notary public   administered the oath of office in the family s parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2 47am on August 3  1923  President Coolidge then went back to bed  He returned to Washington the next day  and was sworn in again by Justice Adolph A  Hoehling Jr  of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia   to forestall the questionable authority of a notary public to administer the presidential oath     The nation initially did not know what to make of Coolidge  who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration  many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924    He appointed C  Bascom Slemp   a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician  to work jointly with Edward T  Clark  a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice presidential staff  as Secretaries to the President  a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff       Although a few of Harding s cabinet appointees were scandal tarred  Coolidge retained all of them  out of an ardent conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obliged to retain Harding s counselors and policies until the next election  Despite this  Coolidge s personality was far more reserved than Harding s  as a result Coolidge replaced speechwriter Judson T  Welliver with Jordan A  Hulseberg to better craft Coolidge s message    Still  Coolidge felt strongly that those of Harding s men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence    Coolidge used his vintage methodical approach towards the scandals  principally Teapot Dome scandal   while others clamored for rapid punishment of those presumed guilty  He found sufficiency in the Senate investigations launched into the scandals  this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved  He did personally intervene in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M  Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe  He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration  he arranged for a full briefing on the wrongdoing  Harry A  Slattery reviewed with him the facts  Harlan F  Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Sen  William E  Borah assessed and presented the political factors     He addressed Congress when it reconvened on December 6  1923  giving a speech that supported many of Harding s policies  including continuance of Harding s formal budgeting process  enforcement of immigration restrictions and arbitration of coal strikes then ongoing in Pennsylvania     Coolidge s speech was the first Presidential speech to be broadcast over the radio    The Washington Naval Treaty was proclaimed just one month into Coolidge s term  and was generally well received in the country    In May 1924  the World War I veterans  World War Adjusted Compensation Act or  Bonus Bill  was passed over his veto    Coolidge signed the Immigration Act later that year  which was aimed at restricting southern and eastern European immigration  he appended a signing statement expressing his unhappiness with the bill s specific exclusion of Japanese immigrants    Just before the Republican Convention began  Coolidge signed into law the Revenue Act of 1924   which reduced the top marginal tax rate from 58  to 46   as well as personal income tax rates across the board  increased the estate tax and bolstered it with a new gift tax      The Republican Convention was held from June 1012  1924 in Cleveland   Ohio   President Coolidge was nominated on the first ballot    The convention nominated Frank Lowden of Illinois for Vice President on the second ballot  but he declined  former Brigadier General Charles G  Dawes   who later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925  was nominated on the third ballot and accepted     The Democrats held their convention the next month in New York City   The convention soon deadlocked  and after 103 ballots  the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate  John W  Davis   with Charles W  Bryan nominated for Vice President  The Democrats  hopes were buoyed when Robert M  La Follette Sr    a Republican Senator from Wisconsin   split from the GOP to form a new Progressive Party   Many believed that the split in the Republican party  like the one in 1912  would allow a Democrat to win the Presidency     After the conventions and the death of his younger son Calvin  Coolidge became withdrawn  he later said that  when he died  the power and glory of the Presidency went with him     In spite of mourning  Coolidge ran his standard campaign  he never maligned his opponents  or even mentioned them by name  and delivered speeches on his theory of government  including several that were broadcast over radio    It was easily the most subdued campaign since 1896  partly because of the grief  but also because Coolidge s style was naturally non confrontational    The other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion  but despite the split in the Republican party  the results were very similar to those of 1920  Coolidge and Dawes won every state outside the South except for Wisconsin  La Follette s home state  Coolidge had a popular vote majority of 2 5million over his opponents  combined total     During Coolidge s presidency  the United States experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the   Roaring Twenties    He left the administration s industrial policy in the hands of his activist Secretary of Commerce  Herbert Hoover   who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio    With the exception of favoring increased tariffs  Coolidge disdained regulation  and demonstrated this by appointing commissioners to the Federal Trade Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission who did little to restrict the activities of businesses under their jurisdiction    The regulatory state under Coolidge was  as one biographer described it   thin to the point of invisibility      Coolidge s economic policy has often been misquoted as  generally speaking  the business of the American people is business   full quotation at right   Some have criticized Coolidge as an adherent of the laissez faire ideology  which they claim led to the Great Depression     On the other hand  historian Robert Sobel offers some context based on Coolidge s sense of federalism    As Governor of Massachusetts  Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation  opposed child labor   imposed economic controls during World War I   favored safety measures in factories  and even worker representation on corporate boards  Did he support these measures while president  No  because in the 1920s  such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments     d      Coolidge s taxation policy was that of his Secretary of the Treasury  Andrew Mellon   the ideal that  scientific taxation lower taxesactually increase rather than decrease government receipts    Congress agreed  and the taxes were reduced in Coolidge s term    In addition to these tax cuts  Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring some of the federal debt     Coolidge s ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress  and in 1924  Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924   which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people    They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928   all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt    By 1927  only the wealthiest 2  of taxpayers paid any federal income tax    Although federal spending remained flat during Coolidge s administration  allowing one fourth of the federal debt to be retired  state and local governments saw considerable growth  surpassing the federal budget in 1927     Perhaps the most contentious issue of Coolidge s presidency was relief for farmers  Some in Congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing the federal government to purchase crops to sell abroad at lower prices    Agriculture Secretary Henry C  Wallace and other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924  but rising prices convinced many in Congress that the bill was unnecessary  and it was defeated just before the elections that year    In 1926  with farm prices falling once more  Senator Charles L  McNary and Representative Gilbert N  Haugen both Republicansproposed the McNaryHaugen Farm Relief Bill   The bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in high yield years and hold it  when feasible  for later sale or sell it abroad    Coolidge opposed McNary Haugen  declaring that agriculture must stand  on an independent business basis   and said that  government control cannot be divorced from political control     He favored instead Herbert Hoover  s proposal to modernize agriculture to create profits  instead of manipulating prices  Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing the McNary Haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation  and it was defeated     After McNary Haugen s defeat  Coolidge supported a less radical measure  the Curtis Crisp Act  which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm co operatives in times of surplus  the bill did not pass    In February 1927  Congress took up the McNary Haugen bill again  this time narrowly passing it and Coolidge vetoed it    In his veto message  he expressed the belief that the bill would do nothing to help farmers  benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy    Congress did not override the veto  but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority  again  Coolidge vetoed it     Farmers never have made much money   said Coolidge  the Vermont farmer s son   I do not believe we can do much about it      Coolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927   the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005    Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief  Coolidge s lack of interest in federal flood control has been criticized    Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything  but it would be seen only as political grandstanding  He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require  he believed property owners should bear much of the cost    On the other hand  Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation    When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928  Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15     Coolidge spoke in favor of the civil rights of African Americans and Catholics     saying in his first State of the Union address that the rights of the former were  just as sacred as those of any other citizen  under the U S  Constitution and that it was a  public and a private duty to protect those rights     He appointed no known members of the Ku Klux Klan to office  indeed  the Klan lost most of its influence during his term    His administration commissioned studies to improve programs for Native Americans   Coolidge repeatedly called for laws to prohibit lynching   saying in his 1923 State of the Union address that it was a  hideous crime  of which African Americans were  by no means the sole sufferers   but consisted of the  majority of the victims     However  most Congressional attempts to pass this legislation were filibustered by Southern Democrats    Coolidge appointed some African Americans to federal office  he retained Harding s choice of Walter L  Cohen of New Orleans   Louisiana   as the comptroller of customs and offered Cohen the post of minister to Liberia   which the businessman declined   On June 2  1924  Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act   which granted U S  citizenship to all American Indians   while permitting them to retain tribal land and cultural rights  However  the act was unclear on whether the federal government or the tribal leaders retained tribal sovereignty    His administration appointed the Committee of One Hundred  a reform panel to examine federal institutions and programs dealing with Indian nations  This committee recommended that the government conduct an in depth investigation into reservation life  health  education  economics  justice  civil rights  etc    This was commissioned through the Department of Interior and conducted by the Brookings Institution   resulting in the groundbreaking Meriam Report of 1928   A few days later  on June 6  1924  Coolidge delivered a commencement address at Washington  D C  s Howard University   in which he thanked and commended African Americans for their rapid advances in education and their contributions to U S  society over the years  as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in World War I   all while being faced with discrimination and prejudices at home   The propaganda of prejudice and hatred which sought to keep the colored men from supporting the national cause completely failed  The black man showed himself the same kind of citizen  moved by the same kind of patriotism  as the white man  They were tempted  but not one betrayed his country       They came home with many decorations and their conduct repeatedly won high commendation from both American and European commanders      No part of the community responded more willingly  more generously  more unqualifiedly  to the demand for special extraordinary exertion  than did the members of the Negro race  Whether in the military service  or in the vast mobilization of industrial resources which the war required  the Negro did his part precisely as did the white man  He drew no color line when patriotism made its call upon him  He gave precisely as his white fellow citizens gave  to the limit of resources and abilities  to help the general cause  Thus the American Negro established his right to the gratitude and appreciation which the Nation has been glad to accord     In August 1924  Coolidge responded to a letter from a New York man that claimed that the United States was a  white man s country  and that African Americans should not be allowed to hold elected office as a result  Echoing his June 1924 speech at Howard University  Coolidge refuted the man s statement  saying that African Americans were  just as truly citizens  of the United States  as are any others   and commended the service of black U S  soldiers during World War I   I was amazed to receive such a letter  During the war 500 000 colored men and boys were called up under the draft  not one of whom sought to evade it   As president  I am  one who feels a responsibility for living up to the traditions and maintaining the principles of the Republican Party  Our Constitution guarantees equal rights to all our citizens  without discrimination on account of race or color  I have taken my oath to support that Constitution  It is the source of your rights and my rights  I propose to regard it  and administer it  as the source of the rights of all the people  whatever their belief or race  A colored man is precisely as much entitled to submit his candidacy in a party primary  as is any other citizen  The decision must be made by the constituents to whom he offers himself  and by nobody else     Speaking before a group of naturalized Americans at the White House in October 1924  Coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an American value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to U S  society  saying that they have  contributed much to making our country what it is   He stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in Europe  it was peculiar for the United States that it was a  harmonious  benefit for the country  Coolidge further stated the United States should assist and help immigrants who come to the country  and urged immigrants to reject   race hatreds   and   prejudices     Among these I should place  first  the broadly tolerant attitude that has been a characteristic of this country  I use the word in its most inclusive sense  to cover tolerance of religious opinion  tolerance in politics  tolerance in social relationships  in general  the liberal attitude of every citizen toward his fellows      As a Nation  our first duty must be to those who are already our inhabitants  whether native or immigrants  To them we owe an especial and a weighty obligation  They came to us with stout hearts and high hopes of bettering their estate  They have contributed much to making our country what it is      They cannot help other nations by bringing old world race prejudices and race hatreds into action here  In fact  they can best help other countries by scrupulously avoiding any such motives     In December 1924  Coolidge delivered his second State of the Union address  in which he commended African Americans for their advances  and stressed that their constitutional rights should be respected and protected   These developments have brought about a very remarkable improvement in the condition of the negro race  Gradually  but surely  with the almost universal sympathy of those among whom they live  the colored people are working out their own destiny  I firmly believe that it is better for all concerned that they should be cheerfully accorded their full constitutional rights  that they should be protected from all of those impositions to which  from their position  they naturally fall a prey  especially from the crime of lynching and that they should receive every encouragement to become full partakers in all the blessings of our common American citizenship     In a May 1926 speech delivered at Arlington to commemorate the U S  military  Coolidge praised the linguistic  ethnic  and religious diversity of the U S  population  citing it as an example of American exceptionalism   He spoke out against   race hatred   and   religious intolerance    saying that engaging in such actions would be an  injury  and not a  benefit  to the country   We are situated differently in this respect from any other country  All the other great powers have a comparatively homogeneous population  close kindred in race and blood and speech  and commonly little divided in religious beliefs  Our great Nation is made up of the strong and virile pioneering stock of nearly all the countries of the world  We have a variety of race and language and religious belief      race hatred  religious intolerance  and disregard of equal rights     are     a positive injury     Although not an isolationist  Coolidge was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances    He considered the 1920 Republican victory as a rejection of the Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations     While not completely opposed to the idea  Coolidge believed the League  as then constituted  did not serve American interests  and he did not advocate membership    He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice   provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions    In 1926  the Senate eventually approved joining the Court  with reservations      The League of Nations accepted the reservations  but it suggested some modifications of their own    The Senate failed to act  the United States never joined the World Court     Coolidge s primary initiative was the KelloggBriand Pact of 1928  named for Coolidge s Secretary of State  Frank B  Kellogg   and French foreign minister Aristide Briand   The treaty  ratified in 1929  committed signatoriesthe United States  the United Kingdom  France  Germany  Italy  and Japanto  renounce war  as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another     The treaty did not achieve its intended resultthe outlawry of warbut it did provide the founding principle for international law after World War II      Coolidge continued the previous administration s policy of withholding recognition of the Soviet Union     He also continued the United States  support for the elected government of Mexico against the rebels there  lifting the arms embargo on that country    He sent Dwight Morrow to Mexico as the American ambassador     Coolidge represented the United States at the Pan American Conference in Havana   Cuba   making him the only sitting President to visit the country  The United States  occupation of Nicaragua and Haiti continued under his administration  but Coolidge withdrew American troops from the Dominican Republic in 1924     In the summer of 1927  Coolidge vacationed in the Black Hills of South Dakota   where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and attended rodeos   He made Custer State Park his  summer White House   While on vacation  Coolidge surprisingly issued his terse statement that he would not seek a second full term as president    I do not choose to run for President in 1928      After allowing the reporters to take that in  Coolidge elaborated   If I take another term  I will be in the White House till 1933 Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had ittoo long     In his memoirs  Coolidge explained his decision not to run   The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them  While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country  it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish     After leaving office  he and Grace returned to Northampton  where he wrote his memoirs  The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of Coolidge s Secretary of Commerce   Herbert Hoover   Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor  on one occasion he remarked that  for six years that man has given me unsolicited adviceall of it bad     Even so  Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary     Coolidge appointed one justice to the Supreme Court of the United States   Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925  Stone was Coolidge s fellow Amherst alumnus  a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican  Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding s Attorney General  Harry M  Daugherty     Stone proved to be a firm believer in judicial restraint and was regarded as one of the court s three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation    President Franklin D  Roosevelt later appointed Stone to be chief justice   Coolidge nominated 17 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 61 judges to the United States district courts   He appointed judges to various specialty courts as well  including Genevieve R  Cline   who became the first woman named to the federal judiciary when Coolidge placed her on the United States Customs Court in 1928    Coolidge also signed the Judiciary Act of 1925 into law  allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload   After his presidency  Coolidge retired to the modest rented house on residential Massasoit Street in Northampton before moving to a more spacious home   The Beeches     He kept a Hacker runabout boat on the Connecticut River and was often observed on the water by local boating enthusiasts  During this period  he also served as chairman of the non partisan Railroad Commission  as honorary president of the American Foundation for the Blind   as a director of New York Life Insurance Company   as president of the American Antiquarian Society   and as a trustee of Amherst College    Coolidge received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Bates College in Lewiston  Maine    Coolidge published his autobiography in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper column   Calvin Coolidge Says   from 1930 to 1931    Faced with looming defeat in the 1932 presidential election   some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their party s nominee  and instead drafting Coolidge to run  but the former President made it clear that he was not interested in running again  and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him  should it come about    Hoover was renominated  and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him  Hoover then lost the general election to Democrat Franklin D  Roosevelt in a landslide     He died suddenly from coronary thrombosis at  The Beeches   at 12 45p m   January 5  1933    Shortly before his death  Coolidge confided to an old friend   I feel I no longer fit in with these times     Coolidge is buried beneath a simple headstone in Plymouth Notch Cemetery   Plymouth Notch   Vermont  where the nearby family home is maintained as one of the original buildings on the Calvin Coolidge Homestead District site  The State of Vermont dedicated a new visitors  center nearby to mark Coolidge s 100th birthday on July 4  1972   Despite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician  Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while President  He made himself available to reporters  giving 520 press conferences  meeting with reporters more regularly than any President before or since    Coolidge s second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio  On December 6  1923  he was the first President whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio    Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927   which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission   On August 11  1924  Theodore W  Case   using the Phonofilm sound on film process he developed for Lee DeForest   filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn  making Coolidge the first President to appear in a sound film  The title of the DeForest film was President Coolidge  Taken on the White House Grounds     When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U S  navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans Atlantic flight  President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U S  and a sound on film record of the event exists  Coolidge was the only president to have his portrait on a coin during his lifetime  the Sesquicentennial of American Independence Half Dollar   minted in 1926  After his death he also appeared on a postage stamp   pictured below   U S  President Ronald W  Reagan regarded Coolidge as his favorite 20th century U S  president because of Coolidge s belief in a more limited U S  federal government  Reagan cited Coolidge s tough handling of striking Boston police when he fired striking air traffic controllers in 1981  Coolidge s reputation remains strong among most political conservatives   Coolidge and Washington on the

 Beach first mentioned the term  Coolidge effect  in publication in 1955  crediting one of his students with suggesting the term at a psychology conference    He attributed the neologism to   an old

she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently  She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told   Dozens of times each day   Mrs  Coolidge said   Tell that to the President when he

Adams Adams    John Adams  Jr   October 30   O S  October 19  1735 July 4  1826  was an American lawyer  author  statesman  and diplomat  He served as the second President of the United States  17971801   the first Vice President  17891797     and as a Founding Father was a leader of American independence from Great Britain     Adams was a political theorist in the Age of Enlightenment who promoted republicanism and a strong central government   His innovative ideas were frequently published  He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent  particularly with his wife and key advisor Abigail    He collaborated with his cousin  revolutionary leader Samuel Adams   but he established his own prominence prior to the American Revolution   After the Boston Massacre   despite severe local anti British sentiment  he provided a successful though unpopular legal defense of the accused British soldiers  driven by his devotion to the right to counsel and the  protect ion  of innocence      As a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress   Adams played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence  He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776  and was its foremost advocate in the Congress  As a diplomat in Europe  he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain   and acquired vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers  Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 which influenced American political theory  as did his earlier Thoughts on Government    Adams  credentials as a revolutionary secured for him two terms as President George Washington s vice president  1789 to 1797  and also his own election in 1796 as the second president  In his single term as president  he encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans   as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party   led by his opponent Alexander Hamilton   Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts   and built up the army and navy in the face of an undeclared naval   Quasi War   with France  The major accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton s opposition  Due to his strong posture on defense  Adams is  often called the father of the American Navy     He was the first U S  president to reside in the executive mansion  now known as the White House      In 1800  Adams lost re election to Thomas Jefferson  and retired to Massachusetts  He resumed his friendship with Jefferson upon the latter s own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years    He and his wife established a family of politicians  diplomats  and historians now referred to as the Adams political family   Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams   the sixth President of the United States  He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence  Modern historians in the aggregate have ranked his administration as the twelfth most successful     John Adams  Jr    was born on October 30  1735  October 19  1735 Old Style  Julian calendar    to John Adams  Sr   16911761  and Susanna Boylston  17081797   He had two younger brothers  Peter and Elihu    Adams  birthplace was Quincy  Massachusetts and is now part of Adams National Historical Park   Adams  mother was from a leading medical family of current Brookline  Massachusetts     His father was a fifth generation descendant of Henry Adams   who emigrated from Braintree  Essex   in England to Braintree  Massachusetts in 16321633    John Adams  Sr   a descendant of Puritans   continued that religious tradition as a Congregationalist deacon   He was also a farmer  a cordwainer  and a lieutenant in the militia  He further served as a selectman  town councilman  and supervised the building of schools and roads  Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship     Though raised in modest surroundings  Adams felt an acute responsibility to live up to his family s heritage of reverence  He was a direct descendent of Puritans  who came to the American wilderness in the 1630s  established a colonial presence in America  and profoundly effected the culture  laws  and traditions of their region  Journalist Richard Brookhiser wrote that Adams  Puritan ancestors  believed they lived in the Bible  England under the Stuarts was Egypt  they were Israel fleeing     to establish a refuge for godliness  a city upon a hill     By the time of John Adams  birth in 1735  Puritan tenets such as predestination were no longer as widely accepted  and many of their stricter practices had moderated with time  but Adams  considered them bearers of freedom  a cause that still had a holy urgency   It was a value system he believed in and wished to live up to    Adams emphatically recalled that his parents   held every Species of Libertinage in   Contempt and horror   and portrayed  pictures of disgrace  or baseness and of Ruin  from any debauchery     Adams  as the eldest child  was under a mandate from his parents to obtain a formal education  This began at age six at a Dame school for boys and girls  which was conducted at a teacher s home  and centered upon The New England Primer   Shortly thereafter  Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly  where studies included Latin  rhetoric  logic and arithmetic  Adams  reflections on early education were in the negative mostly  including incidents of truancy  a dislike for his master and a desire to become a farmer  All questions on the matter ended when his father commanded that he remain in school saying   You shall comply with my desires   Deacon Adams also retained a new school master  Joseph Marsh  and his son responded positively     At age sixteen  Adams entered Harvard College in 1751    He did not share his father s expectation that he become a minister  After graduating in 1755 with an A B  degree   he taught school for a few years in Worcester   Massachusetts while pondering his permanent vocation  In the next four years he discerned a passion for prestige  saying that he craved  Honour or Reputation  and  more defference from  his  fellows   and at age twenty one he was determined to become  a great Man     He decided to become a lawyer to further those ends  writing his father that he found among lawyers  noble and gallant achievements  but among the clergy  the  pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces   Doctrinally  he later became a Unitarian  and dropped belief in predestination  eternal damnation  the divinity of Christ and most other Calvinist beliefs of his Puritan ancestors  Nevertheless  his remnant Puritanism frequently prompted reservations about his hunger for fame  which he once referred to as mere  trumpery   and he questioned his not properly attending to the  happiness of  his  fellow men      The French and Indian War began in 1754 and Adams began to struggle with the issue of a young man s responsibility in the conflict  contemporaries of his social position were largely spectators  while those who were less solvent joined the battle as a means to make some money  Adams later said   I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer   He was acutely aware that he was the first in his family that  degenerated from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia      Adams followed the usual course of reading the law in order obtain his license to practice  In 1756 he became an apprentice in the office of John Putnam  a leading lawyer in Worcester    In 1758  he earned an A M  from Harvard    and was also that year admitted to the bar  having completed his studies under Putnam    From an early age  he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men which are scattered through his diary  which included his report of the 1761 argument of James Otis  Jr  in the Massachusetts Superior Court as to the legality of Writs of Assistance   Otis s argument inspired Adams to the cause of the American colonies    In 1763 he had published seven essays in Boston newspaperstreatises that represented his forging into the convoluted realm of political theory  The essays were offered anonymously  with Adams using the nom de plume  Humphrey Ploughjogger   this author reappeared in the Boston Gazette in 1765 to oppose the Stamp Act    While Adams was initially not as popular as his cousin Samuel  his influence emerged through his work as a constitutional lawyer and his in depth analysis of historical examples  together with his dedication to the principles of republicanism   Even so  Adams often found his inborn contentiousness to be a constraint in his political career     Adams married his third cousin Abigail Smith  17441818  on October 25  1764  Her parents were Elizabeth Quincy and Rev  William Smith  a Congregational minister at Weymouth  Massachusetts     They had six children  Abigail  Nabby  in 1765  future president John Quincy Adams in 1767  Susanna in 1768  Charles in 1770  Thomas in 1772  and Elizabeth  who was stillborn  in 1777     Adams first rose to prominence leading widespread opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765   imposed by the British Parliament without consulting the American legislatures  and requiring payment of a direct tax by the colonies for various stamped documents  Adams in 1765 authored the   Braintree Instructions    a letter sent to the representatives of Braintree in the Massachusetts legislature  which served as a model for other towns  instructions    In the piece he explained that the Stamp Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen  and which all free men deserved  rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried only by a jury of one s peers  The instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties     In August 1765  reprising his pen name  Humphrey Ploughjogger   he contributed four articles to the Boston Gazette  republished in The London Chronicle in 1768 as True Sentiments of America   also known as A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law    He delivered a speech in December before the governor and council in which he pronounced the Stamp Act invalid on the ground that Massachusetts  being without representation in Parliament  had not given its assent to it    He later observed that many protests were sparked by an oft reprinted sermon of the Boston minister  Jonathan Mayhew   invoking Romans 13 to justify insurrection    In 1766  a town meeting of Braintree elected John Adams as a selectman     He moved the family to Boston in April of 1768  renting a clapboard house on Brattle Street  a place known locally as the  White House   He and Abigail and the children lived there for a year  then moved to Cold Lane  still later they moved again  to a larger house in Brattle Square in the center of the city     In 1770  a street confrontation  known as the Boston Massacre   resulted in British soldiers killing five civilians    The accused soldiers were arrested on criminal charges and expectedly had trouble finding legal representation  Adams ultimately agreed to defend them  though he feared it would hurt his reputation  In arguing their case  Adams made his legendary statement regarding jury decisions   Facts are stubborn things  and whatever may be our wishes  our inclinations  or the dictates of our passion  they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence     He also expounded upon Blackstone s Ratio    It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished  for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished  But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned  perhaps to die  then the citizen will say   whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial  for innocence itself is no protection   and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever   Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers  Two of them who had fired directly into the crowd were charged with murder but were convicted only of manslaughter  Adams was paid a small sum by his clients       Biographer John Ferling opines that Adams made the most of juror selection during the Voir dire stage of the trial  saying that Adams      expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury  Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army  but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles   Indeed  Hiller B  Zobel   a scholar who has most closely studied the trial  concluded   we can be fairly sure that before a single witness had been sworn  the outcome of the trial was certain   Ferling also surmises that Adams was likely encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office  when one of Boston s seats in the Massachusetts legislature opened three months later  Adams was the towns first choice to fill the vacancy     His law practice increased greatly from this exposure  as did the demands on his time  In 1771 he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree  but he kept his office in Boston  saying   I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did   He also noted on the day of the family s move   Now my family is away  I feel no Inclination at all  no Temptation  to be any where but at my Office  I am in it by 6 in the Morning  I am in it at 9 at night        In the Evening  I can be alone at my Office  and no where else  I never could in my family   Nevertheless  after some time in the capital  he became disenchanted with the rural and  vulgar  Braintree as a home for his family  In August 1772  therefore  Adams moved his family back to Boston  He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street  not far from his office    In 1774  due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston  Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm  and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home     Governor Thomas Hutchinson and his judges until 1772 received their salaries from the Massachusetts legislature  The Coercive Acts and the Tea Act were then passed by Parliament  and the British Crown assumed payment of those wages  drawn from customs revenues imposed upon that colony  According to biographer Ferling  the British government thus singled out Massachusetts for reprisals of previous rebellion and hoped in the process to force the other colonies into line  Boston radicals protested and asked John Adams to proclaim their objections  In  Two Replies of the Massachusetts House of Representatives to Governor Hutchinson  Adams argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament  Their original charter  as well as their allegiance  was exclusively with the king  If a workable line could not be drawn between parliamentary sovereignty and the total independence of the colonies  he continued  the colonies would have no other choice but independence from England     Adams authored Novanglus  or  A History of the Dispute with America  From Its Origin  in 1754  to the Present Time   he repudiated the essays by Daniel Leonard which in turn defended Hutchinson s arguments for the absolute authority of Parliament over the colonies  In Novanglus   New Englander   Adams gave a point by point refutation of Leonard s essays  and then provided one of the most extensive and learned arguments made by the colonists against British imperial policy  It was a systematic attempt by Adams to describe the origins  nature  and jurisdiction of  unwritten  British concepts of constitutionality  Adams used his wide knowledge of English and colonial legal history to argue that the provincial legislatures were fully sovereign over their own internal affairs  and that the colonies were connected to Great Britain only through the king     The Boston Tea Party a historic demonstration against the British enactmentstook place in December 1773  The British schooner Dartmouth   loaded with tea to be traded subject to the new tea tax  had previously dropped anchor  By 9 00 PM on the night of the 16th  the work of the protesters was donethey had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand poundstodays equivalent of about  1 million  Adams was briefly retained by the Dartmouth owners regarding the question of their liability for the destroyed shipment  Adams applauded the destruction of the tea  There had been no choice  he thought  and he called the defiant boarding of the vessels and the quick obliteration of the dutied beverage the  grandest Event  in the history of the colonial protest movement  He wrote the following day that the destruction of the dutied tea by the protesters had been an  absolutely and indispensably  necessary action     Massachusetts sent Adams to the first and second Continental Congresses in 1774 and from 1775 to 1777 respectively  The Massachusetts delegation resolved to assume a largely passive role in the first Congress  But Adams felt strongly that the conservatives of 1774  men like Joseph Galloway and James Duane   were no different than Hutchinson and Peter Oliver   and he denigrated such men  telling Abigail that  Spiders  Toads  Snakes  are their only proper Emblems  Yet at that point his views were similar to those of conservative John Dickinson   He sought repeal of objectionable policies  but at the early stage he continued to see positive benefits for America remaining part of the British empire     By early 1775  Adams became convinced that Congress was moving in the proper direction  away from its relationship with Great Britain   Reconciliation if practicable   he said publicly  yet he agreed with Benjamin Franklin s confidential observation that independence was inevitable  In the fall of 1775 no one in Congress labored more ardently than Adams to hasten America s separation from Great Britain     In June 1775  with a view of promoting union among the colonies  he nominated George Washington of Virginia as commander in chief of the army then assembled around Boston  His influence in Congress was great  and he then argued in favor of permanent severance from Britain  In October 1775  he was also appointed the chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court  but he never served  and resigned in February 1777     Over the next decade  Americans from every state gathered and deliberated on new governing documents  employing many of Adams  innovative positions  Prior tradition suggested that a society s form of government need not be codified in a single document  As radical as it was to write constitutions  what was equally profound was the revolutionary nature of American political thought as the summer of 1776 dawned     A number of delegates sought Adams  advice about forming new governments  and found his views so convincing they urged him to commit them to paper  He did so in separate letters to these colleagues  each missive a bit longer and more thoughtful  So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that  with Adams s consent  he had the most comprehensive letter printed  Published anonymously just after mid April 1776  it was titled simply Thoughts on Government and styled as  a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend   Many historians agree that none of Adams  other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet     Adams advised that the form of government should be chosen to attain the desired endsthe happiness and virtue of the greatest number of people  He wrote that   There is no good government but what is republican   That the only valuable part of the British constitution is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws  and not of men   The treatise also defended bicameralism   for  a single assembly is liable to all the vices  follies and frailties of an individual     He also suggested that there should be a separation of powers between the executive   the judicial and the legislative branches  and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it  should sacredly be confined  to certain enumerated powers   Thoughts on Government was referenced as an authority in every state constitution writing hall     Adams in the 1776 session of Congress drafted the preamble to the Lee resolution of colleague Richard Henry Lee  Virginia   which called on the colonies to adopt new independent governments    On June 7  1776 he seconded the resolution  which stated   These colonies are  and of right ought to be  free and independent states     Adams also championed the measure until it was adopted by Congress on July 2  Once the resolution passed  independence became inevitable  though it still had to be declared formally  The commitment was  as Adams put it   independence itself      A Committee of Five was charged with drafting the Declaration  and included Adams  along with Thomas Jefferson  Benjamin Franklin  Robert R  Livingston and Roger Sherman     The Committee  after discussing the general outline that the document should follow  decided that Jefferson would write the first draft    Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document  but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally  Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question  Jefferson asked   Why will you not  You ought to do it   To which Adams responded   I will not  reasons enough   Jefferson replied   What can be your reasons   And Adams responded   Reason first  you are a Virginian  and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business  Reason second  I am obnoxious  suspected  and unpopular  You are very much otherwise  Reason third  you can write ten times better than I can    Well   said Jefferson   if you are decided  I will do as well as I can   Adams concluded   Very well  When you have drawn it up  we will have a meeting     The Committee left no minutes  and the drafting process itself is uncertainaccounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams  although frequently cited  are otherwise contradictory    Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson  Adams assumed a primary role in its completion  After editing the document further  Congress approved it on July 4  Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as  the pillar of  the Declaration s  support on the floor of Congress   its  ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered      After defeating the Continental Army at the Battle of Long Island on August 27  1776  British Admiral Richard Howe mistakenly assumed a strategic advantage to be at hand  and requested the Second Continental Congress send representatives in an attempt to negotiate peace  A delegation  including Adams and Benjamin Franklin  met with Howe at the Staten Island Peace Conference on September 11    Howe s authority was premised on the Colonists  submission  so no common ground was to be found    When Lord Howe unhappily stated he could only view the American delegates as British subjects  Adams replied   Your lordship may consider me in what light you please     except that of a British subject     Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from Howe s pardon granting authority    Being quite unimpressed with General Howe  and also after payments to colonial volunteers were increased  Adams in September of 1776 said about the war   We shall do well enough   Indeed  if Washington got his men  the British would be  ruined      In 1777  Adams began serving as the head of the Board of War and Ordnance   in fact  he sat on no less than ninety committees  chairing twenty five  No other congressman approached the assumption of such a work load  As Benjamin Rush reported  he was acknowledged  to be the first man in the House     He was also referred to as a  one man war department     working eighteen hour days and mastering the details of raising  equipping and fielding an army under civilian control  He also authored the  Plan of Treaties   laying out the Congress s requirements for the crucial treaty with France     In the spring of 1776 Adams advocated in Congress that independence was necessary in order to establish trade  and conversely trade was essential for the attainment of independence  he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty with France  He was then appointed  along with Franklin  Dickinson  Benjamin Harrison V of Virginia and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania   to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers   Indeed  while Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence  Adams worked on the Model Treaty      Adams joined Franklin and Arthur Lee in 1778 as a commissioner to France  replacing Silas Deane   He sailed for France with his 10 year old son John Quincy aboard the frigate Boston early that year    The stormy trip was treacherous  with lightning injuring 19 sailors and killing one  Adams  ship was later pursued by several British frigates in the mid Atlantic  but evaded them  Near the coast of Spain  Adams himself took up arms to help capture a heavily armed British merchantman ship  the Martha   Later  a cannon malfunction killed one and injured five more of the crew before the ship arrived in France     Adams did not speak French  the international language of diplomacy at the time    He therefore assumed a less visible role  but emerged as the commissions chief administrator  imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation s finances and record keeping affairs  His first stay in Europe  between April 1  1778  and June 17  1779  was otherwise unremarkable  and he returned to his home in Braintree in early August 1779    Back home  Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780       In the fall of 1779 Adams was unanimously appointed a Minister Plenipotentiary   charged with negotiating a  treaty of peace  amity and commerce  with peace commissioners from Britain    Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional convention  he departed for Europe in November   aboard the French frigate Sensible accompanied by John Quincy and 9 year old son Charles  In France  constant disagreement between Lee and Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie breaker in almost all votes on commission business  Adams also increased his usefulness by mastering the French language  In time Lee was recalled and Adams later developed his own enmity towards the older Franklin  whom the younger  more aggressive Adams felt was overly deferential to the French     The French foreign minister  Charles Gravier disapproved of Adams  so Franklin  Thomas Jefferson  John Jay   and Henry Laurens were appointed to collaborate with Adams  nevertheless  Jefferson did not go to Europe and Laurens was posted to the Dutch Republic   Jay  Adams  and Franklin played the major part in the final negotiations  Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes  Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France  instead  they dealt directly with the British commissioners     Throughout the negotiations  Adams successfully demanded that the right of the United States to the fisheries along the Atlantic coast be recognized  The American negotiators were able to secure a favorable treaty securing most lands east of the Mississippi  and the document was signed on September 3  1783     In July 1780 Adams replaced Laurens as the ambassador to the Dutch Republic  then one of the few other Republics in the world  With the aid of the Dutch Patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol   Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19  1782  In February 1782 the Frisian states was the first Dutch province to recognize the United States  while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition in 1778  He also negotiated a loan of five million guilders financed by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink   By 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders  In October 1782  he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce  the first such treaty between the United States and a foreign power following the 1778 treaty with France    The house that Adams bought during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American owned embassy on foreign soil     In 1784 and 1785  he was one of the architects of extensive trade relations between the United States and Prussia  The Prussian ambassador in The Hague  Friedrich Wilhelm von Thulemeyer   was involved  as were Jefferson and Franklin  who were in Paris     Adams was appointed in 1785 the first American minister to the Court of St  James s  ambassador to Great Britain   When asked by a counterpart if he had any British relatives  Adams replied   Neither my father or mother  grandfather or grandmother  great grandfather or great grandmother  nor any other relation that I know of  or care a farthing for  has been in England these one hundred and fifty years  so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American      Two centuries later  Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom gave historical perspective to Adam s service   John Adams  America s first ambassador  said to my ancestor  King George III  that it was his desire to help with the restoration of  the old good nature and the old good humor between our peoples   That restoration has long been made  and the links of language  tradition  and personal contact have maintained it      Adams was joined by his wife while in London  they suffered the stares and hostility of the Court  and chose to escape it when they could by seeking out Richard Price   minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church and instigator of the Revolution Controversy      Adams  preoccupation with political and governmental affairswhich caused considerable separation from his wife and childrenironically had a distinct familial context  which he articulated in 1780   I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy  My sons ought to study Geography  natural History  Naval Architecture  navigation  Commerce and Agriculture  in order to give their children a right to study Painting  Poetry  Musick  Architecutre  Statuary  Tapestry  and Porcelaine      The Massachusetts Constitution of that year  to which Adams was a primary contributor  structured its government closely on his views of politics and society  in 1779  he drafted the document together with Samuel Adams and James Bowdoin     It was the first constitution written by a special committee  then ratified by the people  and was also the first to feature a bicameral legislature  Included were a distinct executivethough restrained by an executive councilwith a partial  two thirds  veto  and a separate judicial branch     While in London  Adams published a work entitled A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States  1787     In it he repudiated the views of Turgot and other European writers as to the viciousness of state government frameworks  In the book  Adams suggested that  the rich  the well born and the able  should be set apart from other men in a senatethat would prevent them from dominating the lower house  Adams  Defence is described as an articulation of the classical republican theory of mixed government   Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society  and that a good government must accept that reality  For centuries  dating back to Aristotle  a mixed regime balancing monarchy  aristocracy  and democracythat is  the king  the nobles  and the peoplewas required to preserve order and liberty     Wood  2006  has maintained that Adams  political philosophy had became irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified  By then  American political thought  transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures  had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates  Americans  new understanding of popular sovereignty was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation  Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people s power and only for a limited time  Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics    Yet Wood ignored Adams  peculiar definition of the term  republic   and his support for a constitution ratified by the people    He also underestimated Adams  belief in checks and balances   such as Adams  statement that   Power must be opposed to power  and interest to interest   This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison s famous statement that    a mbition must be made to counteract ambition   in The Federalist No  51   explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution      Adams was unsurpassed in his dedication to establishing checks and balances as a governing strategem   On the government s role in education Adams offered unambiguously that   The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expenses of it  There should not be a district of one mile square  without a school in it  not founded by a charitable individual  but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves     When Washington won the presidential election of 1789 with 69 votes in the electoral college   Adams came in second with 34 votes and became Vice President  in that capacity  he became under the Constitution the President pro tempore of the United States Senate   Due to a delay in the decision of the electoral college  Adams first presided over the Senate on April 21  Washington was officially sworn in and gave his inaugural address on April 30  Beyond Adams  nominal position in the Senate  he was allotted a vote as tie breaker when required   he otherwise played a minor role in the politics of the early 1790s  He was reelected Vice President in 1792   Washington seldom asked Adams for input on policy and legal issues during his tenure as vice president     At the start of Washington s administration  Adams became deeply involved in a month long Senate controversy over the official title of the President  Adams favored grandiose titles derived from British Crown tradition  such as  His Majesty the President  or  His High Mightiness  the President of the United States and Protector of Their Liberties   Jefferson described Adams  proposed titles as  superlatively ridiculous     The plain  President of the United States  eventually won the debate  The perceived pomposity of his stance  along with his being overweight  led to Adams earning the nickname  His Rotundity      As president of the Senate  Adams cast a historic 31 tie breaking votes  He thus protected the president s sole authority over the removal of appointees and influenced the location of the nation s capital  But his views did not always align with Washington  who joined Franklin as the object of Adams  ire  as shown in this quote   The History of our Revolution will be one continued lie        The essence of the whole will be that Dr  Franklins electrical Rod smote the Earth and out sprung General Washington  That Franklin electrized him with his Rodand henceforth these two conducted all the Policy  Negotiations  Legislatures and War   On at least one occasion  he persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed  and he frequently lectured the Senate on procedural and policy matters  Adams  political views and his attempt to assume a more active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of the Washington administration  Toward the end of his first term  as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters  he began to exercise more restraint  When the nation s first two opposing political parties formed  he joined the Federalist Party   though he was consistently in opposition with its dominant leader Alexander Hamilton     Adams  two terms as Vice President were frustrating experiences for him  He complained to his wife Abigail   My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived      The 1796 election was the premier contest under the First Party System   Adams was the presumptive presidential nominee of the Federalist Party   the other Federalist candidate was Thomas Pinckney   the Governor of South Carolina   considered electable as the vice president  At that time there was no formal practice of naming a vice presidential nomineethe result was left to the electoral college in determining the vice president as the second place winner of electoral votes     Adams  and Pinckney s opponents  of the Democratic Republican Party   were former Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson of Virginia  who was joined by Senator Aaron Burr of New York as the party s second nominee  Many Federalists would have preferred Hamilton to be a candidate  Although Hamilton supported Adams  his more austere background made him somewhat resentful  some suspected Hamilton of supporting Pinckney over Adams  though this was later demonstrated to be falseHamilton was more determined to defeat Jefferson  Hamilton and his supporters did however believe that Adams lacked the seriousness and popularity that had caused Washington to be successful  and feared that Adams was too vain  opinionated  unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions    Adams vowed he would resign if elected to the second place spot of vice president under Jefferson     Burr was the only active campaigner in the group  In keeping with the current practice  Adams stayed in his home town  as did the others  rather than actively campaign for the Presidency  He specifically wanted to stay out of what he called the  silly and wicked game   His party  however  campaigned for him  while the Democratic Republicans campaigned for Jefferson  It was expected that Adams would dominate the votes in New England  while Jefferson was expected to win the Southern states  In the end  Adams won the election by a narrow margin of 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson  who became the vice president   including one crucial vote from Jefferson s own Virginia and also one from North Carolina     Adams followed Washington s lead in using the presidency to exemplify republican values and civic virtue   and his service was free of scandal  He continued to strengthen the central government  by expanding the navy and army  In July 1798 Adams signed into law the Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen   which authorized the establishment of a government operated marine hospital service     Historians debate his decision to retain en masse the members of Washington s cabinet  Many felt he was oblivious to the political danger of such a decision  in light of the cabinet s loyalty to Hamilton  The  Hamiltonians who surround him   Jefferson soon remarked   are only a little less hostile to him than to me     Although aware of the Hamilton factor  Adams was convinced their retention ensured a smoother succession    Adams  economic programs maintained those of Hamilton  who indeed had regularly consulted with key cabinet members  especially the powerful Secretary of the Treasury  Oliver Wolcott  Jr    Adams was in other respects quite independent of his cabinet  often making decisions despite strong opposition from it  Such self reliance enabled him to avoid war with France  despite a strong desire among his cabinet secretaries for the conflict  The Quasi War with France resulted in the detachment from European affairs that Washington had sought  It also had psychological benefits  allowing America to view itself as holding its own against a European power     Historian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent minded of the founders    Though he aligned with the Federalists  he was somewhat a party unto himself  disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Democratic Republicans    He was often described as  prickly   but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition    Adams was often combative  which diminished presidential decorum  as Adams himself admitted in his old age    As president  I refused to suffer in silence  I sighed  sobbed  and groaned  and sometimes screeched and screamed  And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore     Adams  resolve to advance peace with France  rather than to continue hostilities  especially reduced his popularity    This played an important role in his reelection defeat  however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone  Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts  ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders     The president s term was marked by disputes concerning the country s role  if any  in the expanding conflict in Europe  where Britain and France were at war   Hamilton and the Federalists supported Britain  while Jefferson and the Democratic Republicans favored France    The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss    When Adams entered office  he decided to continue Washington s policy of staying out of the European war  The intense battle over the Jay Treaty in 1795 had previously polarized politics throughout the nation    The French saw America as Britain s junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British  Nevertheless  most Americans were initially pro French due to France s assistance during the Revolutionary War   and would not have sufficiently rallied behind anyone to stop France       Sentiments changed with the XYZ Affair   in which the French demanded huge bribes before any discussions could begin regarding American complaints  this substantially weakened popular American support of France  The pro French Jeffersonians lost support and quickly became the minority as many began to demand full scale war  The affair heightened fears of sedition by the administration s opponents and legislation was introduced in response  The president knew that America would be unable to win a conflict  as France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe  Adams therefore pursued a strategy whereby American ships harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests  This was the undeclared naval war between the U S  and Francethe Quasi War which broke out in 1798     There was danger of invasion from the more powerful French forces  so Adams and the Federalist congress built up the army   bringing back Washington as its commander  Washington wanted Hamilton to be his second in command and Adams reluctantly accommodated    It became apparent that Hamilton was truly in charge due to Washington s advanced years  The angered president remarked at the time   Hamilton I know to be a proud Spirited  conceited  aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality   he wrote  but  with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than anyone I know      Adams also rebuilt the Navy  adding six fast  powerful frigates   most notably the USS Constitution   To pay for the military buildup  Congress imposed new taxes on property  the Direct Tax of 1798      It was the first  and last  such federal tax  Taxpayers were angered  especially in southeast Pennsylvania  where the bloodless Fries s Rebellion broke out among rural German speaking farmers who protested what they saw as a threat to their republican liberties and to their churches       Hamilton assumed control in the War department  and the rift between Adams  and Hamilton s supporters widened  Many sought to vest Hamilton with command authority over the army  and they also resisted giving prominent Democratic Republicans positions in the army  which Adams wanted to do in order to gain bipartisan support  By building a large standing army   Hamilton s supporters raised popular alarms and played into the hands of the Democratic Republicans  They also alienated Adams and his large personal following  They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need to pull together the entire nation in the face of war with France  Overall  however  patriotic sentiments and a series of naval victories  popularized the war as well as the president     In February 1799  Adams surprised many by sending diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France  Napoleon   realizing that the conflict was pointless  signaled his readiness for friendly relations  At the Convention of 1800 the Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements  as Washington had advised in his farewell address  Adams brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army    Adams proudly avoided war  but deeply split his party in the process     Despite the discredit of the XYZ Affair  the Democratic Republicans  opposition persisted  In the midst of war  which included the reign of terror during the French Revolution   political tensions were incendiary  Some pro French Democratic Republicans even fostered a movement in America  similar to the French Revolution  to overthrow the Federalists    When Democratic Republicans in some states refused to enforce federal laws  some Federalists voiced the intention to send in an army and force them to capitulate  As the hostility sweeping Europe bled over into America  calls for secession began to reach new heights    Some Federalists accused the French and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest  In an attempt to quell the uprising  the Federalists introduced  and the Congress passed  a series of laws collectively referred to as the Alien and Sedition Acts   which were signed by Adams in 1798     Congress specifically passed four measures  the Naturalization Act   the Alien Friends Act  the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act  These statutes were designed to mitigate the threat of secessionists by disallowing their most extreme firebrands  The Naturalization Act increased to 14 years the period of residence required for an immigrant to attain American citizenship  naturalized citizens tended to vote for the Democratic Republicans   The Alien Friends Act and the Alien Enemies Act allowed the president to deport any foreigner  from friendly and hostile nations  respectively  which he considered dangerous to the country  The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish  false  scandalous  and malicious writing  against the government or its officials  Punishments included 25 years in prison and fines of up to  5 000  Although Adams had not promoted any of these acts  he signed them into law     The acts became controversial from prosecution thereunder of a Congressman and a number of newspaper editors  Indeed  the Federalist administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act  as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Democratic Republican newspapers  The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799  and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential electiontiming that hardly appeared coincidental  according to biographer Ferling  Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced  namely  1  only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified  2  Adams never signed a deportation order  and 3  the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Democratic Republicans  However  other historians have emphasized that the Acts were employed for political targeting from the outset  causing many aliens to leave the country  The Acts as well allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists  even on the floor of Congress    In any case  the election of 1800 in fact became a bitter and volatile contest  with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other and its policies  after Democratic Republicans prevailed in the elections of 1800  they used the acts against Federalists before the laws finally expired     The death of Washington in 1799 weakened the Federalists  as they lost the one man who united the party  In the presidential election of 1800   Adams and his fellow Federalist candidate  Charles Cotesworth Pinckney   opposed the Republican ticket of Jefferson and Burr  Hamilton tried his hardest to sabotage Adams  campaign in the hope of boosting Pinckney s chances of winning the presidency  In the end  Adams lost narrowly to Jefferson by 65 to 73 electoral votes  with New York providing the decisive margin     Adams  defeat resulted from 1  the stronger organization of the Democratic Republicans  2  Federalist disunity  3  the controversy of the Alien and Sedition Acts  4  the popularity of Jefferson in the south and 5  the effective politicking of Aaron Burr in New York State   where the legislature shifted from Federalist to Democratic Republican on the basis of a few wards in New York City controlled by Burr s machine     In the closing months of his term Adams became the first president to occupy the new  but unfinished President s Mansion  later known as the White House  beginning November 1  1800       I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it   Adams wrote on his second night in the mansion   May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof      After his defeat in the hotly contested election  Adams was depressed when he left office  His son Charles had also recently died from alcoholism  and he was anxious to rejoin his wife Abigail  who had left for Massachusetts months before the inauguration  As a result  he did not attend Jefferson s inauguration  departing the White House at 4 00 a m  that day  and making him one of only four presidents surviving in office not to attend his successor s inauguration  Adams  correspondence with Jefferson at the time is not indicative of the animosity and resentment that scholars have attributed to him     Adams named John Marshall as the fourth Chief Justice of the United States to succeed Oliver Ellsworth   who had retired due to ill health  Marshall s long tenure represents the most lasting influence of the Federalists  as he infused the Constitution with a judicious and carefully reasoned nationalistic interpretation and established the Judicial Branch as the equal of the Executive and Legislative branches     The lame duck session of Congress in late 1800 enacted the Judiciary Act of 1801  which created a set of federal appeals courts between the district courts and the Supreme Court  The purpose of the statute was twofoldfirst  to remedy the defects in the federal judicial system inherent in the Judiciary Act of 1789   and second  to enable the defeated Federalists to staff the new judicial offices with loyal Federalists in the face of the party s defeat in 1800the party had lost control of both houses of congress in addition to the White House    Adams filled the vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges  whom his opponents called the   Midnight Judges   because most of them were appointed just days before his presidential term expired  Most of these judges lost their posts when the Jeffersonian Republicans enacted the Judiciary Act of 1802  abolishing the courts created by the Judiciary Act of 1801 and returning the federal courts to their original structure as specified in the 1789 statute     Adams resumed farming at his home Peacefield in the town of Quincy  he also began work on an autobiography  which he never finished  and resumed correspondence with such old friends as Benjamin Waterhouse and Benjamin Rush      After Jefferson s retirement from public life in 1809  Adams became more vocal  He published a three year marathon of letters in the Boston Patriot newspaper  refuting line by line an 1800 pamphlet by Hamilton which attacked his conduct and character  Though Hamilton had died in 1804 in a duel with Aaron Burr   Adams felt the need to vindicate his character against the New Yorker s vehement charges     The years of retirement in the Adams  household were not without some temporary financial adversity  in 1803 the bank holding his cash reserves of about  13 000 collapsed  Son John Quincy came to the rescue by purchasing from him his properties in Weymouth and Quincy  including Peacefield  for the sum of  12 800     Daughter Abigail   Nabby   was married to Representative William Stephens Smith   but she returned to her parents  home after the failure of the marriage  she died of breast cancer in 1813  His wife Abigail died of typhoid on October 28  1818  His son Thomas and wife Ann  along with seven children  lived with Adams to the end of Adams  life  as well as Louisa Smith  Abigail s niece by her brother William     Sixteen months before John Adams  death  his son  John Quincy Adams   became the sixth president of the United States in 1825  the only son to succeed his father as President until George W  Bush in 2001     In early 1812  Adams reconciled with Jefferson  Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush   a fellow signer of the Declaration of Independence who had been corresponding with both  encouraged them to reach out to the other  On New Year s Day Adams sent a brief  friendly note to Jefferson to accompany the delivery of  two pieces of homespun   a two volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by John Quincy Adams  Jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter  and the two men revived their friendship  which they sustained by mail  The correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted the rest of their lives  and has been hailed as among their great legacies of American literature     Their letters represent an insight into both the period and the minds of the two revolutionary leaders and Presidents  The missives lasted fourteen years  and consisted of 158 letters109 from Adams and 49 from Jefferson    The two men discussed  natural aristocracy   Jefferson said   The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction  the trusts  and government of society  And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state  and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society  May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural  aristocrats  into the offices of government     Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were   Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded  Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature  as genius  strength  or beauty        When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour  wealth  and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions  then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence   It would always be true  Adams argued  that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue  That being the way of nature  he thought such  talents  were natural  A good government  therefore  had to account for that reality     Less than a month before his death  Adams issued a statement about the destiny of the United States  which historians such as Joy Hakim have characterized as a  warning  for his fellow citizens   My best wishes  in the joys  and festivities  and the solemn services of that day on which will be completed the fiftieth year from its birth  of the independence of the United States  a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race  destined in future history to form the brightest or the blackest page  according to the use or the abuse of those political institutions by which they shall  in time to come  be shaped by the human mind      On July 4  1826  the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence  Adams died at his home in Quincy  at approximately 6 20 PM    Jefferson died earlier the same day    Adams  crypt lies at United First Parish Church in Quincy  Massachusetts  with his wife Abigail and son John Quincy Adams     Adams never bought a slave and declined on principle to utilize slave labor  saying   I have  through my whole life  held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence  that I have never owned a negro or any other slave  though I have lived for many years in times  when the practice was not disgraceful  when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character  and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men  which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap     Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics  because of the anticipated southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence    He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts  saying that the issue was presently too divisive  and so the legislation should  sleep for a time     He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution  due to opposition from southerners    Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780  when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution    Abigail Adams  on the other hand  vocally opposed slavery     Throughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions    At times he conveyed substantial support for these approaches    suggesting for example that  hereditary monarchy or aristocracy  are the  only institutions that can possibly preserve the laws and liberties of the people     Yet at other times he distanced himself from such ideas  calling himself  a mortal and irreconcilable enemy to Monarchy  and  no friend to hereditary limited monarchy in America     Such denials did not assuage his critics  and Adams was often accused of being a Monarchist     Many of these attacks are considered to have been scurrilous  including suggestions that he was planning to  crown himself king  and  grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne     However  Peter Shaw has argued that    T he inevitable attacks on Adams  crude as they were  stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself  He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy  as distinct from kings and aristocrats  at the time he wrote  Davila   though he did not directly reveal this in its essays  Decidedly  sometime after he became vice president  Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch    and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life     In contradiction to such notions  Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson   If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King  Lords and Commons  or in other words an hereditary Executive  or an hereditary Senate  either into the government of the United States  or that of any individual state  in this country  you are wholly mistaken  There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine  and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse      Adams was raised a Congregationalist   since his ancestors were Puritans  According to biographer McCullough   as his family and friends knew  Adams was both a devout Christian  and an independent thinker     In a letter to Benjamin Rush  Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World in the 1630s    Adams was educated at Harvard when the influence of deism was growing there  and sometimes used deistic terms in his speeches and writing    He also believed that regular church service was beneficial to man s moral sense  Everett  1966  concludes that  Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness  and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection    Fielding  1940  argues that Adams  beliefs synthesized Puritan  deist  and humanist concepts  Adams at one point said that Christianity had originally been revelatory   but was being misinterpreted and misused in the service of superstition  fraud  and unscrupulous power    Goff  1993  acknowledges Fielding s  persuasive argument that Adams never was a deist because he allowed the suspension of the laws of nature and believed that evil was internal  not the result of external institutions      Frazer  2004  notes that while Adams shared many perspectives with deists   Adams clearly was not a deist  Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God  consequently  deists did not believe in miracles or God s providence    Adams  however  did believe in miracles  providence  and  to a certain extent  the Bible as revelation     Frazer further argues that Adams   theistic rationalism  like that of the other Founders  was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism     By contrast  David L  Holmes has argued that Adams  beginning as a Congregationalist  ended his days as a Christian Unitarian  accepting central tenets of the Unitarian creed  but also accepting Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical account of his miracles as true    Like many of his Protestant contemporaries  Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Roman Catholic Church    In 1796  Adams denounced political opponent Thomas Paine  s deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason   saying   The Christian religion is  above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times  the religion of wisdom  virtue  equity and humanity  let the Blackguard Paine say what he will      Adams  grandson Charles Francis Adams  Sr  edited the first two volumes of The Works of John Adams  Esq   Second President of the United States   This was published between 1850 and 1856 by Charles C  Little and James Brown in Boston  The first seven chapters were produced by Adams  son John Quincy Adams     The premier modern biography was Honest John Adams   a 1933 biography by the noted French specialist in American history Gilbert Chinard  who came to Adams after writing his acclaimed 1929 biography of Thomas Jefferson   For a generation  Chinard s work was regarded as the best life of Adams  and it is still a key factor in determining the themes of Adams  biographical and historical scholarship  Following the opening of the Adams family papers in the 1950s  Page Smith published the first major biography to use these previously inaccessible primary sources  his biography won a 1962 Bancroft Prize but was criticized for its scanting of Adams  intellectual life and its diffuseness  In 1975  Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams  a thematic biography noted for its psychological insight into Adams  life  The 1992 character study by Joseph J  Ellis   Passionate Sage  The Character and Legacy of John Adams  was Ellis s first major publishing success and remains one of the most useful and insightful studies of Adams  personality  In 1992  the Revolutionary War historian and biographer John E  Ferling published his acclaimed John Adams  also noted for its psychological sensitivity     In 2001  historian David McCullough published a biography entitled John Adams   that won various awards  McCullough s biography was the basis for a 2008 TV miniseries

Historiography    World War II  Lyndon Baines Johnson       l   n d   n   b e  n z   d    n s   n     August 27  1908  January 22  1973   often referred to as LBJ   was the 36th President of the United States  19631969   a position he assumed after his service as the 37th Vice President  19611963   Johnson was a Democrat from Texas who served as a United States Representative from 1937 to 1949 and as a United States Senator from 1949 to 1961  including six years as Senate Majority Leader   two as Senate Minority Leader  and two as Senate Majority Whip    Johnson campaigned for the Democratic nomination in the 1960 presidential election   He was unsuccessful  but was chosen by Senator John F  Kennedy of Massachusetts to be his running mate  They went on to win the election and Johnson was sworn in as Vice President on January 20  1961  Two years and ten months later  on November 22  1963  Johnson succeeded Kennedy as President following his assassination   He ran for a full term in the 1964 election   winning by a large margin over Republican opponent Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater   He is one of four people   a   who have served as President and Vice President  as well as in both houses of Congress     Johnson was strongly supported by the Democratic Party  and as President he designed the   Great Society   legislation upholding civil rights   public broadcasting   Medicare   Medicaid   aid to education  the arts  urban and rural development  public services  and his   War on Poverty    Assisted in part by a growing economy  the War on Poverty helped millions of Americans rise above the poverty line during Johnson s presidency    Civil rights bills signed by Johnson banned racial discrimination in public facilities  interstate commerce  the workplace  and housing  and the Voting Rights Act banned certain requirements in southern states used to disenfranchise African Americans  With the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965   the country s immigration system was reformed and all national origin quotas were removed  Johnson was renowned for his domineering  sometimes abrasive  personality and the  Johnson treatment his aggressive coercion of powerful politicians to advance legislation   Johnson escalated American involvement in the Vietnam War   In 1964  Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution   which granted Johnson the power to use military force in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war  The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically  from 16 000 advisors in non combat roles in 1963    to 550 000 in early 1968  many in combat roles  American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down  Growing unease with the war stimulated a large  angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses in the U S  and abroad     Johnson faced further troubles when summer riots broke out in most major cities after 1965  and crime rates soared  as his opponents raised demands for  law and order  policies  While he began his presidency with widespread approval  support for Johnson declined as the public became upset with both the war and the growing violence at home  In 1968  the Democratic Party factionalized as antiwar elements denounced Johnson  he ended his bid for renomination after a disappointing finish in the New Hampshire primary  Republican Richard Nixon was elected to succeed him  as the New Deal coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years collapsed  After he left office in January 1969  Johnson returned to his Texas ranch where he died of a heart attack at age 64 on January 22  1973   Historians argue that Johnson s presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States after the New Deal era  Johnson is ranked favorably by some historians because of his domestic policies and the passage of many major laws  affecting civil rights  gun control  wilderness preservation   and Social Security         Lyndon Baines Johnson was born August 27  1908 in Stonewall  Texas   in a small farmhouse on the Pedernales River   the oldest of five children born to Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr   18771937  and Rebekah Baines  18811958   Johnson had one brother  Sam Houston Johnson  191478   and three sisters  Rebekah  191078   Josefa  191261   and Lucia  191697   The nearby small town of Johnson City  Texas   was named after LBJ s cousin  James Polk Johnson  whose forebears had moved west from Oglethorpe County   Georgia  Johnson had English   Ulster Scot and German ancestry    He was maternally descended from a pioneer Baptist clergyman  George Washington Baines   who pastored eight churches in Texas  as well as others in Arkansas and Louisiana  Baines  the grandfather of Johnson s mother  was also the president of Baylor University during the American Civil War     citation needed    Johnson s grandfather  Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr    was raised as a Baptist  and for a time was a member of the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ    In his later years the grandfather became a Christadelphian   Johnson s father also joined the Christadelphian Church toward the end of his life    Later  as a politician  Johnson was influenced in his positive attitude toward Jews by the religious beliefs that his family  especially his grandfather  had shared with him  see Operation Texas      Johnson s favorite Bible verse came from the King James Version of Isaiah 1 18   Come now  and let us reason together         In school  Johnson was an awkward  talkative youth and was elected president of his 11th grade class  He graduated from Johnson City High School  1924   having participated in public speaking  debate  and baseball      At age 15  Johnson was the youngest member of his class and is believed to have been the youngest graduate of the school  In the months following his graduation  Johnson moved to California amid pressure by his parents to go to college  Johnson supported himself by picking grapes    He enrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers College  SWTSTC  in the summer of 1924  where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th grade courses needed for admission to SWTSTC at San Marcos  Johnson later said that he was kicked out of the school     In 1926  Johnson enrolled at SWTSTC  now Texas State University    He worked his way through school  participated in debate and campus politics  and edited the school newspaper  The College Star     The college years refined his skills of persuasion and political organization  For nine months  from 1928 to 1929  Johnson paused his studies to teach Mexican American children at the segregated Welhausen School in Cotulla   some 90 miles  140km  south of San Antonio in La Salle County   The job helped him to save money to complete his education  and he graduated in 1930  He taught in Pearsall High School in Pearsall  Texas   and afterward took a position as teacher of public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston    When he returned to San Marcos in 1965  after signing the Higher Education Act of 1965   Johnson reminisced   I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School  and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor  And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American     After teaching in Houston  Johnson entered politics  in 1930  he campaigned for Texas State Senator Welly Hopkins in his run for Congress  Hopkins recommended him to Congressman Richard M  Kleberg   who made Johnson his legislative secretary  Johnson was elected speaker of the  Little Congress   a group of Congressional aides  where he cultivated Congressmen  newspapermen and lobbyists  Johnson s friends soon included aides to President Franklin D  Roosevelt   as well as fellow Texans such as Vice President John Nance Garner   He also became a surrogate son to Sam Rayburn    Johnson married Claudia Alta Taylor   also known as  Lady Bird   of Karnack  Texas on November 17  1934  after he attended Georgetown University Law Center for several months  They had two daughters  Lynda Bird   born in 1944  and Luci Baines   born in 1947  Johnson gave his children names with the LBJ initials  his dog was Little Beagle Johnson  His was the LBJ Ranch   his initials were on his cufflinks  ashtrays  and clothes     In 1935  he was appointed head of the Texas National Youth Administration   which enabled him to use the government to create education and job opportunities for young people  He resigned two years later to run for Congress  Johnson  a notoriously tough boss throughout his career  often demanded long workdays and work on weekends    He was described by friends  fellow politicians  and historians as motivated by an exceptional lust for power and control  As Johnson s biographer Robert Caro observes   Johnson s ambition was uncommonin the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology  of philosophy  of principles  of beliefs      In 1937  Johnson successfully contested a special election for Texas s 10th congressional district   that covered Austin and the surrounding hill country  He ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife  He served in the House from April 10  1937  to January 3  1949    President Franklin D  Roosevelt found Johnson to be a welcome ally and conduit for information  particularly with regard to issues concerning internal politics in Texas   Operation Texas   and the machinations of Vice President John Nance Garner and Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn   Johnson was immediately appointed to the Naval Affairs Committee   He worked for rural electrification and other improvements for his district  Johnson steered the projects towards contractors that he personally knew  such as the Brown Brothers  Herman and George  who would finance much of Johnson s future career    In 1941  he ran for the U S  Senate in a special election against the sitting Governor of Texas   radio personality W  Lee  Pappy  O Daniel   Johnson lost the election   Having already been appointed a Lieutenant Commander in the U S  Naval Reserve on June 21  1940  Johnson  who was still in congress  reported for active duty three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941  His orders were to report to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington  D C  for instruction and training    Following his training  he asked Undersecretary of the Navy James Forrestal for a combat assignment    He was sent instead to inspect the shipyard facilities in Texas and on the West Coast   In the spring of 1942  President Roosevelt needed his own reports on what conditions were like in the Southwest Pacific   Roosevelt felt that information which flowed up the military chain of command needed to get delivered by a highly trusted political aide  From a suggestion by Forrestal  President Roosevelt assigned Johnson to a three man survey team of the Southwest Pacific     Johnson reported to General Douglas MacArthur in Australia  Johnson and two Army officers went to the 22nd Bomb Group base  which was assigned the high risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at Lae in New Guinea   A colonel took Johnson s allocated seat on one bomber  and it was shot down with no survivors  Reports vary on what happened to the B 26 Marauder carrying Johnson  He said that it was also attacked by Japanese fighters but survived  while others  including other members of the flight crew  claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire  This is supported by official flight records    Other airplanes that continued to the target did come under fire near the target at about the same time that Johnson s plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase  MacArthur awarded Johnson the Silver Star   the military s third highest medal     Johnson reported to Roosevelt  to the Navy leaders  and to Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable  He argued that the South West Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies  The warplanes sent there  for example  were  far inferior  to Japanese planes  and morale was bad  He told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a  critical  need for 6 800 additional experienced men  Johnson prepared a twelve point program to upgrade the effort in the region  stressing  greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters   Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee    with a mission similar to that of the Truman Committee in the Senate  He probed the peacetime  business as usual  inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done  Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often  organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him  Johnson s biographer  Robert Dallek concludes   The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson s personal and political wishes  but it also represented a genuine effort on his part  however misplaced  to improve the lot of America s fighting men      In the 1948 elections   Johnson again ran for the Senate and won in a highly controversial result in a three way Democratic Party primary   Johnson faced a well known former governor  Coke Stevenson   and a third candidate  Johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented helicopter dubbed  The Johnson City Windmill   He raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by voting for the Taft Hartley act  curbing union power  as well as by criticizing unions  Stevenson came in first but lacked a majority  so a runoff was held  Johnson campaigned even harder  while Stevenson s efforts slumped   The runoff count took a week  handled by the Democratic State Central Committee  because this was a party primary   Johnson was finally announced the winner by 87 votes out of 988 295 cast  The Committee voted to certify Johnson s nomination by a majority of one  2928   with the last vote cast on Johnson s behalf by Temple  Texas   publisher Frank W  Mayborn   There were many allegations of voter fraud  one writer alleges that Johnson s campaign manager  future Texas governor John B  Connally   was connected with 202 ballots in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County where the names had curiously been listed in alphabetical order with the same pen and handwriting  just at the close of polling  Some of these voters insisted that they had not voted that day    Robert Caro argued in his 1989 book that Johnson had thus stolen the election in Jim Wells County  and that 10 000 ballots were also rigged in Bexar County alone    Election judge Luis Salas said in 1977 that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots for Johnson    The state Democratic convention upheld Johnson  Stevenson went to court  but Johnson prevailedwith timely help from his friend Abe Fortas   He soundly defeated Republican Jack Porter in the general election in November and went to Washington  permanently dubbed  Landslide Lyndon   Johnson  dismissive of his critics  happily adopted the nickname     Once in the Senate  Johnson was known among his colleagues for his highly successful  courtships  of older senators  especially Senator Richard Russell   Democrat from Georgia  the leader of the Conservative coalition and arguably the most powerful man in the Senate  Johnson proceeded to gain Russell s favor in the same way that he had  courted  Speaker Sam Rayburn and gained his crucial support in the House   Johnson was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee  and later in 1950  he helped create the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee  Johnson became its chairman and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency  These investigations revealed old investigations and demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the Truman Administration  although it can be said that the committee s investigations reinforced the need for changes  Johnson gained headlines and national attention through his handling of the press  the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports  and the fact that he ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee  Johnson used his political influence in the Senate to receive broadcast licenses from the Federal Communications Commission in his wife s name      After the 1950 general elections  Johnson was chosen as Senate Majority Whip in 1951 under the new Majority Leader  Ernest McFarland of Arizona   and served from 1951 to 1953     In the 1952 general election Republicans won a majority in both the House and Senate  Among defeated Democrats that year was McFarland  who lost to upstart Barry Goldwater  In January 1953  Johnson was chosen by his fellow Democrats to be the minority leader  he became the most junior Senator ever elected to this position  One of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in appointment to a committee  while retaining it for chairmanships  In the 1954 election   Johnson was re elected to the Senate  and since the Democrats won the majority in the Senate  Johnson then became majority leader  Former majority leader William Knowland became minority leader  Johnson s duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the Democrats  Johnson  Rayburn and President Dwight D  Eisenhower worked well together in passing Eisenhower s domestic and foreign agenda    citation needed    During the Suez Crisis   Johnson tried to prevent the US government from criticizing the Israeli invasion of the Sinai peninsula  Along with the rest of the nation  Johnson was appalled by the threat of possible Soviet domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite Sputnik 1   and used his influence to ensure passage of the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act   which established the civilian space agency NASA    Historians Caro and Dallek consider Lyndon Johnson the most effective Senate majority leader in history  He was unusually proficient at gathering information  One biographer suggests he was  the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known   discovering exactly where every Senator stood on issues  his philosophy and prejudices  his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote    Robert Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips in order to avoid their dissenting votes    Central to Johnson s control was  The Treatment     described by two journalists   A 60 cigarette per day smoker  Johnson suffered a near fatal heart attack on July 2  1955  He abruptly gave up smoking as a result  with only a couple of exceptions  and did not resume the habit until he left the White House on January 20  1969   Johnson s success in the Senate rendered him a potential Democratic presidential candidate  he had been the   favorite son   candidate of the Texas delegation at the Party s national convention in 1956  and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination  Jim Rowe repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959  but Johnson thought it better to wait  thinking that John Kennedy s efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited  Rowe finally joined the Humphrey campaign in frustration  another move which Johnson thought played into his own strategy    Johnson s late entry into the campaign in July 1960  coupled with a reluctance to leave Washington  allowed the rival Kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among Democratic state party officials  Johnson underestimated Kennedy s endearing qualities of charm and intelligence  as compared to his own reputation as the more crude and wheeling dealing  Landslide Lyndon     Caro suggests that Johnson s hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure     Johnson attempted in vain to capitalize on Kennedy s youth  poor health  and failure to take a position regarding Joseph McCarthy    He had formed a  Stop Kennedy  coalition with Adlai Stevenson   Stuart Symington   and Hubert Humphrey   but it proved a failure  Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention  which nominated John F  Kennedy  Tip O Neill was a representative from Kennedy s home state of Massachusetts at that time  and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said   Tip  I know you have to support Kennedy at the start  but I d like to have you with me on the second ballot   O Neill replied   Senator  there s not going to be any second ballot      According to Kennedy s Special Counsel Myer Feldman and to Kennedy himself  it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which Johnson s vice presidential nomination ultimately took place  Kennedy did realize that he could not be elected without support of traditional Southern Democrats   most of whom had backed Johnson  nevertheless  labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson  After much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter  Kennedy did offer Johnson the vice presidential nomination at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel at 10 15am on July 14  the morning after he was nominated  and Johnson accepted  From that point to the actual nomination that evening  the facts are in dispute in many respects   Convention chairman LeRoy Collins   declaration of a two thirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed      Seymour Hersh stated that Robert F  Kennedy  known as Bobby  hated Johnson for his attacks on the Kennedy family  and later maintained that his brother offered the position to Johnson merely as a courtesy  expecting him to decline  Arthur M  Schlesinger Jr  concurred with Robert Kennedy s version of events  and put forth that John Kennedy would have preferred Stuart Symington as his running mate   alleging that Johnson teamed with House Speaker Sam Rayburn and pressured Kennedy to favor Johnson     Biographer Robert Caro offered a different perspective  he wrote that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close election against Richard Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge Jr    Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry Texas and the Southern states   Caro s research showed that on July 14  John Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep  At 6 30am  John Kennedy asked Robert Kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes  including Texas     Robert called Pierre Salinger and Kenneth O Donnell to assist him  Salinger realized the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own  and asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy Johnson ticket  and Robert replied  yes     Caro contends that it was then that John Kennedy called Johnson to arrange a meeting  he also called Pennsylvania governor David L  Lawrence   a Johnson backer  to request that he nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role  According to Caro  Kennedy and Johnson met and Johnson said that Kennedy would have trouble with Kennedy supporters who were antiJohnson  Kennedy returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy Johnson ticket to his closest supporters  including northern political bosses  O Donnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by Kennedy  who had previously cast Johnson as anti labor and anti liberal  Afterward  Robert Kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and  after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson  Robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnsonapparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy s authorization     Caro continues in his analysis that Robert Kennedy tried to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president  Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy  Despite his brother s interference  John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate  he met with staffers such as Larry O Brien   his national campaign manager  to say that Johnson was to be vice president  O Brien recalled later that John Kennedy s words were wholly unexpected  but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation  he thought  it was a stroke of genius     When John and Robert Kennedy next saw their father Joe Kennedy   he told them that signing Johnson as running mate was the smartest thing that they had ever done     At the same time as his Vice Presidential run  Johnson also sought a third term in the U S  Senate  According to Robert Caro   On November 8  1960  Lyndon Johnson won election for both the vice presidency of the United States  on the Kennedy Johnson ticket  and for a third term as Senator  he had Texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices   When he won the vice presidency  he made arrangements to resign from the Senate  as he was required to do under federal law  as soon as it convened on January 3  1961      In 1988  Lloyd Bentsen   the Vice Presidential running mate of Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis   and also a Senator from Texas  took advantage of  Lyndon s law   and was able to retain his seat in the Senate despite Dukakis  loss to George H  W  Bush     Johnson was re elected Senator with 1 306 605 votes  58percent  to Republican John Tower  s 927 653  41 1percent   Fellow Democrat William A  Blakley was appointed to replace Johnson as Senator  but Blakley lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower   After the election  Johnson was quite concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office  and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position  He initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency  since that office made him president of the Senate  but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus  including members whom he had counted as his supporters     Johnson sought to increase his influence within the Executive Branch  He drafted an executive order for Kennedy s signature  granting Johnson  general supervision  over matters of national security  and requiring all government agencies to  cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments   Kennedy s response was to sign a non binding letter requesting Johnson to  review  national security policies instead    Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office  and to employ a full time Vice Presidential staff within the White House    His lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy appointed Johnson s friend Sarah T  Hughes to a federal judgeship  whereas Johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for Hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency  House Speaker Sam Rayburn wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill   Moreover  many members of the Kennedy White House were contemptuous of Johnson  including the president s brother and Attorney General Robert F  Kennedy  and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque  crude manner  Congressman Tip O Neill recalled that the Kennedy men  had a disdain for Johnson that they didn t even try to hide    They actually took pride in snubbing him      Kennedy  however  made efforts to keep Johnson busy  informed  and at the White House often  telling aides   I can t afford to have my vice president  who knows every reporter in Washington  going around saying we re all screwed up  so we re going to keep him happy     Kennedy appointed him to jobs such as head of the President s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities  through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities  Kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position  but Taylor Branch in Pillar of Fire contends that Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration s actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy originally intended to go  Branch notes the irony of Johnson being the advocate for civil rights   when the Kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters  In particular  he notes Johnson s Memorial Day 1963 speech at Gettysburg  Pennsylvania as being a catalyst that led to more action   Johnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions  which gave him limited insights into global issues  as well as opportunities at self promotion in the name of showing the country s flag  He was allowed to observe Cabinet and National Security Council meetings  Kennedy gave Johnson control over all presidential appointments involving Texas  and appointed him chairman of the President s Ad Hoc Committee for Science     Kennedy also appointed Johnson Chairman of the National Aeronautics Space Council   The Soviets beat the US with the first manned spaceflight in April 1961  and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating the state of the US space program and recommending a project that would allow the US to catch up or beat the Soviets    Johnson responded with a recommendation that the US gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a project to land an American on the Moon in the 1960s       Kennedy assigned priority to the space program  but Johnson s appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure     Johnson was touched by a Senate scandal in August 1963 when Bobby Baker   the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a protg of Johnson s  came under investigation by the Senate Rules Committee for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance  One witness alleged that Baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the Vice President  Baker resigned in October  and the investigation did not expand to Johnson  The negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the upcoming 1964 presidential election  However  on October 31  1963  a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have Johnson on the ticket the following year  Kennedy replied   Yes to both those questions     There is little doubt that Robert Kennedy and Johnson hated each other    yet John and Robert Kennedy agreed that dropping Johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the South in the 1964 election  and they agreed that Johnson would stay on the ticket       Johnson s presidency took place during a healthy economy  with steady growth and low unemployment  Regarding the rest of the world  there were no serious controversies with major countries  Attention therefore focused on domestic policy  and  after 1966  on the Vietnam War   Johnson was quickly sworn in as President on the Air Force One plane in Dallas on November 22  1963  just 2 hours and 8 minutes after John F  Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas  amid suspicions of a conspiracy against the government    He was sworn in by U S  District Judge Sarah T  Hughes   a family friend  In the rush  a Bible was not at hand  so Johnson took the oath of office using a Roman Catholic missal from President Kennedy s desk    Johnson being sworn in as president has become the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft       He was convinced of the need to make an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation under shock  He and the secret service were concerned that he could also be a target of a conspiracy  and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from Dallas and return him to Washington  This was greeted by some with assertions that Johnson was in too much haste to assume power     In the days following the assassination  Lyndon B  Johnson made an address to Congress saying that  No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy s memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long     The wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson s promise to carry out Kennedy s plans and his policy of seizing Kennedy s legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda   On November 29  1963 just one week after Kennedy s assassination  Johnson issued an executive order to rename NASA s Apollo Launch Operations Center and the NASA Air Force Cape Canaveral launch facilities as the John F  Kennedy Space Center    Cape Canaveral was officially known as Cape Kennedy from 1963 1973       Johnson was alert to the public demand for answers  To head off snowballing speculation about such conspiracies  he immediately created a panel headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren   known as the Warren Commission   to investigate Kennedy s assassination    The commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination  Conspiracy theorists were not satisfied and they kept active for decades     Johnson retained senior Kennedy appointees  some for the full term of his presidency  this includes Kennedy s brother Attorney General Robert F  Kennedy   with whom Johnson had a notoriously difficult relationship  Robert F  Kennedy remained in office for a few months until leaving in 1964 to run for the Senate    Although Johnson had no official chief of staff  Walter Jenkins was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the White House  George Reedy   who was Johnson s second longest serving aide  assumed the post of press secretary when John F  Kennedy s own Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964    Horace Busby was another  triple threat man   as Johnson referred to his aides  He served primarily as a speech writer and political analyst    Bill Moyers was the youngest member of Johnson s staff  He handled scheduling and speechwriting part time     The new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy s primary legislative goalsa tax cut  Johnson worked closely with Harry F  Byrd of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below  100 billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the Revenue Act of 1964   Congressional approval followed at the end of February  and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights    In late 1963 Johnson also launched the initial offensive of his War on Poverty   recruiting Kennedy relative Sargent Shriver   then head of the Peace Corps   to spearhead the effort  In March 1964  LBJ sent to Congress the Economic Opportunity Act   which created the Job Corps and the Community Action Program   designed to attack poverty locally  The act also created VISTA   Volunteers in Service to America  a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps     President Kennedy had submitted a civil rights bill to congress in June 1963  which was met with strong opposition      Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill  This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail  but if it were successful  Johnson would receive ample credit    Historian Robert Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past  southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote    In particular  they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent  especially the tax reform bill  in order to force the bill s supporters to pull it     Johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic  as he played a role in a similar tactic against the civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to congress fifteen years earlier    In that fight  a rent control renewal bill was held up until the civil rights bill was withdrawn    Believing that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate  he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy  who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process  By tackling the tax cut first  the previous tactic was eliminated     Passing the civil rights bill in the house required getting it through the Rules Committee  which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it  Johnson decided on a campaign to use a discharge petition to force it onto the house floor    Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed  the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full house  which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290110    In the Senate  since the tax bill had passed three days earlier  the anti civil rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool  Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans  who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill    According to Caro  it was ultimately Johnson s ability to convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964  after 75 hours of debate  the bill passed the senate by a vote of 7129      Johnson signed the fortified Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on July 2    Legend has it that as he put down his pen Johnson told an aide   We have lost the South for a generation   anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson s Democratic Party     Johnson wanted a catchy slogan for the 1964 campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for 1965  Eric Goldman  who joined the White House in December of that year  thought Johnson s domestic program was best captured in the title of Walter Lippman s book  The Good Society   Richard Goodwin tweaked itto   The Great Society   and incorporated this in detail as part of a speech for Johnson in May 1964 at the University of Michigan   It encompassed movements of urban renewal  modern transportation  clean environment  anti poverty  healthcare reform  crime control  and educational reform     In August 1964  allegations arose from the military that two US destroyers had been attacked by some North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters 40 miles  64km  from the Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of Tonkin  naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory  Although Johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about Vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign  he felt forced to respond to the supposed aggression by the Vietnamese  so he sought and obtained from the Congress the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7  Johnson  determined to embolden his image on foreign policy  also wanted to prevent criticism such as Truman had received in Korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action  a response to the purported attack as well blunted presidential campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish Goldwater camp  The resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commander in chief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of SEATO requesting assistance  Johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary US goal remained the preservation of South Vietnamese independence through material and advice  as opposed to any US offensive posture    The public s reaction to the resolution at the time was positive48 percent favored stronger measures in Vietnam and only 14 percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave     In Spring 1964  Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected as president in his own right    A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding   Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike  After considerable horse trading  especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the IRS  Johnson got an agreement  This substantially boosted his self confidence as well as his image     That same year  Robert F  Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as Johnson s vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy however had never liked one another and Johnson  afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president  abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn    Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and  knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson  was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration  Ultimately  Goldwater s poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate    Hubert Humphrey s selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion  and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast    Johnson  knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president  put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision  he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage     In preparation for the Democratic convention  Johnson requested the FBI send a squad of 30 agents to cover convention activities  the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities on the floor  The squad s focus narrowed upon the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  MFDP  delegation  which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state  The squad s activities also included wiretaps of Martin Luther King s room as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  SNCC  and the Congress of Racial Equality  CORE   From beginning to end  the squad s assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high ranking officials     In fact  Johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation  and he assigned Humphrey the job of managing the problem    The convention s Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to  bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote by reason of their race or color     The MFDP rejected the committee s ruling  The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved  but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left  SNCC chairman John Lewis would call it a  turning point in the civil rights movement      Early in the 1964 presidential campaign  Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender  with strong support from the South  which threatened Johnson s position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act  However  Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed  On September 7  1964  Johnson s campaign managers broadcast the   Daisy ad    It portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy   counting up to ten  Then a baritone voice took over  counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb  The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war  Goldwater s campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming  In your heart  you know he s right    Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson s campaign with bumper stickers that said  In your heart  you know he might  and  In your gut  you know he s nuts     Johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61 05percent of the vote  making it the highest ever share of the popular vote     At the time  this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th centurymore than 15 95million votesthis was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon s victory in 1972     In the Electoral College   Johnson defeated Goldwater by margin of 486 to 52  Johnson won 44 states  compared to Goldwater s six  Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR s election in 1936a Senate with a 68 32 majority and a house with a 295140 Democratic margin     Johnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office  ready to  carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy  Not because of our sorrow or sympathy  but because they are right     He was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out  Nevertheless  the Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama led by Martin Luther King ultimately led Johnson to initiate debate on a voting rights bill in February 1965     Johnson gave a congressional speechDallek considers it his greatestin which he said  rarely at anytime does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itselfrarely are we met with the challenge to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation  The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue  And should we defeat every enemy  should we double our wealth and conquer the stars  and still be unequal to this issue  then we will have failed as a people and as a nation     In 1965  he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act   which outlawed discrimination in voting thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time  In accordance with the act  several states   seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy   Alabama  South Carolina  North Carolina  Georgia  Louisiana  Mississippi  Virginia  were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965 while Texas  home to the majority of the African American population at the time  followed in 1975    The Senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of 77 19 just after 2 1 2 months and won passage in the house in July  by 33385  The results were significantbetween the years of 1968 and 1980  the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled  The act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationallyin 1965  a few hundred black office holders mushroomed to 6 000 in 1989     After the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo   Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four Ku Klux Klansmen implicated in her death  He angrily denounced the Klan as a  hooded society of bigots   and warned them to  return to a decent society before it s too late   Johnson was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since Ulysses S  Grant about 93 years earlier    He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights  thereby mobilizing support from churches North and South    At the Howard University commencement address on June 4  1965  he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve goals   To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice  but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin  To dissolve  as best we can  the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder  divide the great democracy  and do wronggreat wrongto the children of God       In 1967  Johnson nominated civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to be the first African American Associate Justice of the Supreme Court  To head the new Department of Housing and Urban Development   Johnson appointed Robert C  Weaver the first African American cabinet secretary in any U S  presidential administration  In 1968 Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968   which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race  creed  or national origin  The impetus for the law s passage came from the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement   the April 4  1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr    and the civil unrest across the country following King s death    On April 5  Johnson wrote a letter to the United States House of Representatives urging passage of the Fair Housing Act    With newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic Speaker of the House John McCormack   the bill  which was previously stalled  passed the House by a wide margin on April 10       With the passage of the sweeping Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965   the country s immigration system was reformed and all national origins quotas dating from the 1920s were removed  The annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970  and doubled again by 1990  with dramatic increases from Asia and Mexico    Scholars give Johnson little credit for the law  which was not one of his priorities  he had supported the McCarren Walters Act of 1952 that was unpopular with reformers     Johnson  whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas  fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty  and was an essential component of the American dream   especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight fisted budgets from local taxes    He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda  with an emphasis on helping poor children  After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen  LBJ launched a legislative effort which took the name of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  ESEA  of 1965  The bill sought to double federal spending on education from  4 billion to  8 billion     with considerable facilitating by the White House  it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26 and then it remarkably passed without change in the Senate  by 73 to 8  without going through the usual conference committee  This was an historic accomplishment by the president  with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before     For the first time  large amounts of federal money went to public schools  In practice ESEA meant helping all public school districts  with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families  which included all the big cities     For the first time private schools  most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities  received services  such as library funding  comprising about 12percent of the ESEA budget  Though federal funds were involved  they were administered by local officials  and by 1977 it was reported that less than half of the funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line  Dallek further reports that researchers cited by Hugh Davis Graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received  Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs  but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes  Johnson s second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965   which focused on funding for lower income students  including grants  work study money  and government loans   He set up the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts   to support humanists and artists  as the WPA once did   Although ESEA solidified Johnson s support among K 12 teachers  unions  neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam    In 1967  Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks   In 1964  at Johnson s request  Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act   as part of the war on poverty   Johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as Head Start   food stamps and Work Study     During Johnson s years in office  national poverty declined significantly  with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 percent to 12 percent     Johnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort  presenting to Congress in January 1966 the  Demonstration Cities Program   To be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to  arrest blight and decay and make substantial impact on the development of its entire city   Johnson requested an investment of  400 million per year totaling  2 4 billion  In the fall of 1966 the Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing  900 million  which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program   Changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill  the New York Times wrote 22 years later that the program was for the most part a failure     Johnson s initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease  Cancer and Strokes  HDCS   Combined  these diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nation s deaths in 1962    To enact recommendations of the commission  Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program  RMP   to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice  Congress passed a significantly watered down version   As a back up position  in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security    The key player in initiating this program  named Medicare   was Wilbur Mills   Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  In order to reduce Republican opposition  Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cakehospital insurance under Social Security  a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor  known as Medicaid     The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8  The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated  however  the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee    Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans    Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence  Missouri      On October 22  1968  Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968   one of the largest and farthest reaching federal gun control laws in American history  Much of the motivation for this large expansion of federal gun regulations came as a response to the assassinations of John F  Kennedy   Robert F  Kennedy   and Martin Luther King Jr   During Johnson s administration  NASA conducted the Gemini manned space program  developed the Saturn V rocket and its launch facility   and prepared to make the first manned Apollo program flights  On January 27  1967  the nation was stunned when the entire crew of Apollo 1 was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad  stopping Apollo in its tracks  Rather than appointing another Warren style commission  Johnson accepted Administrator James E  Webb  s request for NASA to do its own investigation  holding itself accountable to Congress and the President    Johnson maintained his staunch support of Apollo through Congressional and press controversy  and the program recovered  The first two manned missions  Apollo 7 and the first manned flight to the Moon  Apollo 8   were completed by the end of Johnson s term  He congratulated the Apollo 8 crew  saying   You ve taken     all of us  all over the world  into a new era       On July 16  1969  Johnson attended the launch of the first Moon landing mission Apollo 11   becoming the first former or incumbent US president to witness a rocket launch   Major riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of  long hot summers   They started with a violent disturbance in Harlem riots in 1964  and the Watts district of Los Angeles in 1965  and extended to 1971  The momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in the summer of 1965  with the riots in Watts  After 34 lives were lost  along with  35 million in property damage  the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities  and so the appetite was lost for additional programs in LBJ s agenda     The biggest wave of riots came April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King  Newark burned in 1967  where six days of rioting left 26 dead  1500 injured  and the inner city a burned out shell  In Detroit in 1967   Governor George Romney sent in 7400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings  looting  and attacks on businesses and on police  Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns  Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead  2250 were injured  4000 were arrested  property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions  Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing  but this fell on deaf ears  Johnson s popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape  reinforcing the sense Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party    Johnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots  headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner     According to press secretary George Christian  Johnson was unsurprised by the riots  saying   What did you expect  I don t know why we re so surprised  When you put your foot on a man s neck and hold him down for three hundred years  and then you let him up  what s he going to do  He s going to knock your block off      In 1966 the press sensed a   credibility gap   between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in Vietnam  which led to much less favorable coverage     By year s end  the Democratic governor of Missouri   Warren E  Hearnes   warned that Johnson would lose the state by 100 000 votes  despite winning by a 500 000 margin in 1964   Frustration over Vietnam  too much federal spending and    taxation  no great public support for your Great Society programs  and     public disenchantment with the civil rights programs  had eroded the President s standing  the governor reported  There were bright spots  in January 1967  Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history  unemployment was at a 13 year low  and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever  a 4 5 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome  as was the rise in interest rates   Johnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending  Johnson s approval ratings stayed below 50 percent  by January 1967  the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16   from 25 percent four months before  He ran about even with Republican George Romney in trial matchups that spring  Asked to explain why he was unpopular  Johnson responded   I am a dominating personality  and when I get things done I don t always please all the people   Johnson also blamed the press  saying they showed  complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to   He also blamed  the preachers  liberals and professors  who had turned against him    In the congressional elections of 1966   the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House  reinvigorating the conservative coalition and making it more difficult for Johnson to pass any additional Great Society legislation  However  in the end Congress passed almost 96 percent of the administration s Great Society programs  which Johnson then signed into law     In October 1966  Johnson became the first serving U S  president to visit Australia  His visit sparked demonstrations from anti war protesters     Johnson subscribed to the Domino Theory in Vietnam and to a containment policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion    At Kennedy s death  there were 16 000 American military personnel in Vietnam    Johnson immediately reversed Kennedy s order to withdraw 1 000 military personnel by the end of 1963    He expanded the numbers and roles of the American military following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident soon after the Republican Convention of 1964    Johnson in late summer 1964 seriously questioned the value of staying in Vietnam but  after meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D  Taylor   declared his readiness  to do more when we had a base  or when Saigon was politically more stable    In the 1964 presidential campaign  he restated his determination to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea  but privately he had a sense of foreboding about Vietnama feeling that no matter what he did things would end badly  Indeed  his heart was on his Great Society agenda  and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty  The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf  as well as an attack on Bien Hoa airbase in South Vietnam    Johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs and also after public pollster Lou Harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls    By the end of 1964  there were approximately 23 000 military personnel in South Vietnam  U S  casualties for 1964 totaled 1 278     In the winter of 196465 Johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam  moreover  a plurality in the polls at the time were in favor of military action against the communists  with only 26 to 30 percent opposed    Johnson revised his priorities  and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon  He then agreed with Mac Bundy and McNamara  that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation  Johnson said   Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do what we ought to do  I m prepared to do that  we will move strongly  General Nguy n Khnh  head of the new government  is our boy      Johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate US action to avoid defeat  also  the Viet Cong had just killed eight US advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at Pleiku Air Base   The eight week bombing campaign became known as Operation Rolling Thunder   Johnson s instructions for public consumption were clearthere was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded    Long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Viet Cong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Viet Cong into an intensification of the war  But the short term expectations were consistent   that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered  By limiting the information given out to the public and even to Congress  Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course     In March Bundy began to urge the use of ground forcesAmerican air operations alone he counseled would not stop Hanoi s aggression against the South  Johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18 000 to 20 000  the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron  in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisionsand most importantly a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations  nevertheless  he disobligingly continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy     In early 1965 Johnson sent U S  Marines to the Dominican Republic to protect the embassy there and to respond to yet another perceived communist threat by the escalating civil war   That spring an agreement was reached at the urging of the OAS and the US to end the uprising  this crisis reinforced Johnson s belief it was essential to convince supporters and opponents at home and abroad that he had an effective strategy to meet the communist challenge in Vietnam     After a conference of advisors in Honolulu in April 1965  by the middle of June the total US ground forces in Vietnam were increased to 82 000 or by 150 percent    On May 2  1965 Johnson told congressional leaders that he wanted an additional  700 million for Vietnam and the Dominican Republic saying  each member of Congress who supports this request is voting to continue our effort to try to hold communist aggression   The request was approved by the House 408 to 7 and by the Senate 88 to 3    In June Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective  and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse    Gen  Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82 000 to 175 000  After consulting with his principals  Johnson  desirous of a low profile  chose to announce at a press conference an increase to 125 000 troops  with additional forces to be sent later upon request  In order to mute his announcement  Johnson at the same time announced the nomination of Abe Fortas to the Supreme Court and John Chancellor as director of the Voice of America  Johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choicesbetween sending Americans to die in Vietnam and giving in to the communists  If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached  He continued to insist that his decision  did not imply any change in policy whatsoever   Of his desire to veil the decision  Johnson jested privately   If you have a mother in law with only one eye  and she has it in the center of her forehead  you don t keep her in the living room     By October 1965 there were over 200 000 troops deployed in Vietnam     Polls showed that beginning in 1965  the public was consistently 4050percent hawkish and 1025percent dovish  Johnson s aides told him   Both hawks and doves  are frustrated with the war      and take it out on you     Politically  Johnson closely watched the public opinion polls  His goal was not to adjust his policies to follow opinion  but rather to adjust opinion to support his policies  Until the Tet Offensive of 1968  he systematically downplayed the war  he made very few speeches about Vietnam  and held no rallies or parades or advertising campaigns  He feared that publicity would charge up the hawks who wanted victory  and weaken both his containment policy and his higher priorities in domestic issues  Jacobs and Shapiro conclude   Although Johnson held a core of support for his position  the president was unable to move Americans who held hawkish and dovish positions    On April 2  1965  the current Canadian Prime Minister  Lester B  Pearson   gave a speech at Temple University in Philadelphia   During his speech  he voiced his support for a pause in the American bombing of North Vietnam  so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may unfold  To President Johnson  this criticism of American foreign policy on American soil was an intolerable sin  Before Pearson had finished his speech  he was summoned to Camp David  Maryland   to meet with Johnson the next day  Johnson  who was notorious for his personal touch in politics  reportedly grabbed Pearson by the lapels and shouted   Don t you come into my living room and piss on my rug        At the end of 1965 after consultation with the joint Chiefs and other advisers Johnson decided to increase troops at the rate of 15 000 per month throughout 1966 rather than increasing them at one time  in order to avoid a more publicized increase  At the same time there was deliberation over a bombing pause and Johnson finally agreed on December 28 to a pause and a corresponding  peace offensive   the pause in bombing and the peace blitz ended January 31 without discernible effect  Disturbed by criticism of the war  then underscored with public hearings by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January  Johnson convened a second Honolulu conference  and personally attended for three days along with Ambassador  Lodge  Gen  Westmoreland  the Vietnamese Chief of State Nguyen Van Thieu and Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky    In April 1966 Johnson was encouraged by statistics that the Viet Cong had suffered greater numbers of casualties than the South Vietnamese  at the same time  despite urgings in Honolulu to strengthen his internal affairs  Prime Minister Ky s administration was increasingly vulnerable to rebel forces  The administration pressured Ky to hasten a transfer of power to an assembly but he demurred     Public as well as political impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of 1966  At the time  when Johnson s approval ratings were reaching new lows of 41 percent  Sen  Richard Russell   Chairman of the Armed Services Committee  reflected the national mood in June 1966  when he declared it was time to  get it over or get out     Johnson responded by saying to the press   we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost     In response to the intensified criticism of the war effort  Johnson employed the suspicion of communist subversion in the country  and press relations became strained    Johnson s primary war policy opponent in Congress included among others the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee  James William Fulbright     The persistent Johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum  oil and lubrication facilities in North Vietnam in hopes of accelerating victory    Humphrey  Rusk and McNamara all agreed  the bombing began the end of June    In July polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a 5 to 1 margin  however  in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on North Vietnam     In the fall of 1966 however  multiple sources began to report progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure  Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions  There was no shortage of peace initiatives  nevertheless  among protesters  English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Johnson s policy as  a barbaric aggressive war of conquest  and in June he initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal as a means to condemn the American effort    The gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces  In August  Johnson appointed Averell Harriman  Ambassador for Peace  to promote negotiations  Westmoreland and McNamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification  Johnson formally placed this effort under military control in October    Also in October 1966  to reassure and promote his war effort  Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manilathe South Vietnamese  Thais  South Koreans  Filipinos  Australians and New Zealanders    The conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in Vietnam and across Asia    For Johnson it was a fleeting public relations successconfirmed by a 63 percent Vietnam approval rating in November    Nevertheless  in December Johnson s Vietnam approval rating was again back down in the 40s  LBJ had become anxious to justify war casualties  and talked of the need for decisive victory  despite the unpopularity of the cause    In a discussion about the war with former President Dwight Eisenhower on October 3  1966  Johnson said he was  trying to win it just as fast as I can in every way that I know how  and later stated that he needed  all the help I can get      By year s end it was clear that current pacification efforts were ineffectual  as had been the air campaign  Johnson then agreed to McNamara s new recommendation to add 70 000 troops in 1967 to the 400 000 previously committed  While McNamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing  Johnson agreed with CIA recommendations to increase them    The increased bombing began despite initial secret talks in being held in Saigon  Hanoi and Warsaw  While the bombing ended the talks  North Vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine     January and February 1967 included probes to detect North Vietnamese willingness to discuss peace  and all fell on deaf ears  Ho Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral withdrawal by the U S    Corrected military estimates released in March indicated a greater number of enemy initiated actions between February 1966 and 1967  this exemplified the unreliability of information coming from the ground in Vietnam  similar discrepancies existed in measuring the movement of supplies and forces from North to South and assessing Viet Cong manpower  In February Johnson nevertheless agreed to attacks on infiltration routes in Laos and fifty four new targets in the North  as well as the mining of inland waterways to complement bombing     In March Robert Kennedy assumed a more public opposition to the war in a Senate speech  The fact of his opposition and probable candidacy for the presidency in 1968  according to Dallek  inhibited the embattled and embittered Johnson from employing a more realistic war policy    Johnson s anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to Vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to Kennedy  Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer  and warned Kennedy   I ll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months   he shouted   You ll be dead politically in six months     In June a decisive 66  of the country said they had lost confidence in the President s leadership    McNamara actually offered Johnson a way out of Vietnam in May  the administration could declare its objective in the warSouth Vietnam s self determinationwas being achieved and upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government  The United States could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome  But Johnson was reluctant  in light of some optimistic reports  again of questionable reliability  which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided a glimmer of hope  The CIA was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid  as well as military manpower reductions     By the middle of 1967 nearly 70 000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war  In July  Johnson sent McNamara  Wheeler and other officials to meet with Westmoreland and reach agreement on plans for the immediate future  At that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a  stalemate   Westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction  and that  we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes     Though Westmoreland sought many more  Johnson agreed to an increase of 55 000 troops bringing the total to 525 000   A Gallup poll in July showed 52 percent of the country disapproving of the president s handling of the war and only 34 percent thought progress was being made     In August Johnson  with the Joint Chiefs  support  decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi  Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list    Later that month McNamara told a Senate subcommittee that an expanded air campaign would not bring Hanoi to the peace tablethe Joint Chiefs were astounded  and threatened mass resignationMcNamara was summoned to the White House for a three hour dressing down  nevertheless  Johnson had received reports from the CIA confirming McNamara s analysis at least in part  In the meantime an election establishing a constitutional government in the South was concluded and provided hope for peace talks     Despite the election  the South Vietnam government remained incompetent and riddled with corruption  but  in September Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong appeared amenable to French mediation  so Johnson ceased bombing in a 10 mile zone around Hanoi  this was met with dissatisfaction  Johnson in a Texas speech agreed to halt all bombing if Ho Chi Minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if North Vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt  this was named the  San Antonio  formula  There was no response  but Johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause     Fellow Democrat Tip O Neill joined the ranks of those opposed to the war in late 1967  And with the ever increasing public protests against the war  in October Johnson engaged the FBI and the CIA to investigate  monitor and undermine antiwar activists    In mid October there was a demonstration of 100 000 at the Pentagon  Johnson and Rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration  which was refuted by CIA findings     With the war still arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict  Johnson convened a group called the  Wise Men  for a fresh  in depth look at the warDean Acheson  Gen  Omar Bradley  George Ball  Mac Bundy  Arthur Dean  Douglas Dillon  Abe Fortas  Averell Harriman  Henry Cabot Lodge  Robert Murphy and Max Taylor    At that time McNamara  reversing his position on the war  recommended that a cap of 525 000 be placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted  since he could see no success  Johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and described McNamara as  ready to pull another Forrestal  a reference to the suicide of former Defense Secretary James Forrestal   McNamara s resignation soon followed     With the exception of George Ball  the  Wise Men  all agreed the administration should  press forward     Johnson was confident that Hanoi would await the 1968 US election results before deciding to negotiate     As casualties mounted and success seemed further away than ever  Johnson s popularity plummeted  College students and others protested  burned draft cards  and chanted   Hey  hey  LBJ  how many kids did you kill today     Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests  and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the 1968 Democratic National Convention   where thousands of hippies   yippies   Black Panthers and other opponents of Johnson s policies both in Vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest    Thus by 1968  the public was polarized  with the  hawks  rejecting Johnson s refusal to continue the war indefinitely  and the  doves  rejecting his current war policies  Support for Johnson s middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement  By late summer  he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey  He continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election  and personally despised Nixon  One of Johnson s well known quotes was  the Democratic party at its worst  is still better than the Republican party at its best      On January 30 came the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Tet offensive against South Vietnam s five largest cities  including Saigon and the US embassy there and other government installations  While the Tet offensive failed militarily  it was a psychological victory  definitively turning American public opinion against the war effort  Iconically  Walter Cronkite of CBS news  voted the nation s  most trusted person  in February expressed on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing  Johnson reacted  saying  If I ve lost Cronkite  I ve lost middle America     Indeed  demoralization about the war was everywhere  26  then approved of Johnson s handling of Vietnam  63  disapproved  Johnson agreed to increase the troop level by 22 000  despite a recommendation from the Joint Chiefs for ten times that number    By March 1968 Johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war  Clark Clifford  the new Defense Secretary  described the war as  a loser  and proposed to  cut losses and get out     On March 31 Johnson spoke to the nation of  Steps to Limit the War in Vietnam   He then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and announced his intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at anytime  At the close of his speech he also announced   I shall not seek  and I will not accept  the nomination of my party for another term as your President      In March Johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that 90 percent of North Vietnam s population and 75 percent of its territory was off limits to bombing  In April he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks and after extensive negotiations over the site  Paris was agreed to and talks began in May  When the talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in Paris    Two months later it was apparent that private discussions proved to be no more productive    Despite recommendations in August from Harriman  Vance  Clifford and Bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for Hanoi to seriously engage in substantive peace talks  Johnson refused    In October when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt  Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese  and made promises of better terms  so as to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election    After the election  Johnson s primary focus on Vietnam was to get Saigon to join the Paris peace talks  Ironically  only after Nixon added his urging did they do so  Even then they argued about procedural matters until after Nixon took office     A few analysts have theorized that  Vietnam had no independent impact on President Johnson s popularity at all after other effects  including a general overall downward trend in popularity  had been taken into account     The war grew less popular  and continued to split the Democratic Party  The Republican Party was not completely pro  or anti war  and Nixon managed to get support from both groups by running on a reduction in troop levels with an eye toward eventually ending the campaign   Johnson often privately cursed the Vietnam War and  in a conversation with Robert McNamara   he assailed  the bunch of commies  running The New York Times for their articles against the war effort    In two weeks in May 1968 alone American deaths numbered 1 800 with total casualties at 18 000  Alluding to the Domino Theory  he said   If we allow Vietnam to fall  tomorrow we ll be fighting in Hawaii  and next week in San Francisco    Johnson once summed up his perspective of the Vietnam War as follows   I knew from the start that I was bound to be crucified either way I moved  If I left the woman I really lovedthe Great Society in order to get involved in that bitch of a war on the other side of the world  then I would lose everything at home  All my programs     But if I left that war and let the Communists take over South Vietnam   then I would be seen as a coward and my nation would be seen as an appeaser and we would both find it impossible to accomplish anything for anybody anywhere on the entire globe     Biographers including Dallek have said that Johnson suffered  agonizing decisions  in the Vietnam war and felt it caused divisions both in the U S  and abroad    Johnson was afraid that if he tried to defeat the North Vietnamese regime with an invasion of North Vietnam  rather than simply try to protect South Vietnam  he might provoke the Chinese to stage a full scale military intervention similar to their intervention in 1950 during the Korean War   as well as provoke the Soviets into launching a full scale military invasion of western Europe  It was not until the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s that it was finally confirmed that the Soviets had several thousand troops stationed in North Vietnam throughout the conflict  as did China   In March 1965  Johnson sent to Congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new Transportation Departmentwhich would include the Commerce Department s Office of Transportation  the Bureau of Public Roads  the Federal Aviation Agency  the Coast Guard  the Maritime Administration  the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Interstate Commerce Commission  The bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects  in the house  passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed October 15  1965     In a 1993 interview for the Johnson Presidential Library oral history archives  Johnson s Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that a carrier battle group   the U S  6th Fleet   sent on a training exercise toward Gibraltar was re positioned back towards the eastern Mediterranean to be able to assist Israel during the Six Day War of June 1967  Given the rapid Israeli advances following their strike on Egypt  the administration  thought the situation was so tense in Israel that perhaps the Syrians  fearing Israel would attack them  or the Soviets supporting the Syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack Israel   The Soviets learned of this course correction and regarded it as an offensive move  In a hotline message from Moscow  Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin said   If you want war you re going to get war      The Soviet Union supported its Arab allies    In May 1967  the Soviets started a surge deployment of their naval forces into the East Mediterranean  Early in the crisis they began to shadow the US and British carriers with destroyers and intelligence collecting vessels  The Soviet naval squadron in the Mediterranean was sufficiently strong to act as a major restraint on the U S  Navy    In a 1983 interview with The Boston Globe   McNamara claimed that  We damn near had war   He said Kosygin was angry that  we had turned around a carrier in the Mediterranean      During his presidency  Johnson issued 1187 pardons and commutations     granting over 20percent of such requests     As he had served less than 24 months of President Kennedy s term  Johnson was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the 1968 presidential election under the provisions of the 22nd Amendment       Initially  no prominent Democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting president of the Democratic Party  Only Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti war candidate in the New Hampshire primary   hoping to pressure the Democrats to oppose the Vietnam War  On March 12  McCarthy won 42percent of the primary vote to Johnson s 49percent  an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger  Four days later  Sen  Robert F  Kennedy of New York entered the race  Internal polling by Johnson s campaign in Wisconsin   the next state to hold a primary election  showed the President trailing badly  Johnson did not leave the White House to campaign   By this time Johnson had lost control of the Democratic Party  which was splitting into four factions  each of which generally disliked the other three  The first consisted of Johnson  and Humphrey   labor unions  and local party bosses  led by Chicago Mayor Richard J  Daley    The second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind McCarthy  The third group were Catholics  Hispanics and African Americans  who rallied behind Robert Kennedy   The fourth group were traditionally segregationist white Southerners  who rallied behind George C  Wallace and the American Independent Party   Vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party  and Johnson could see no way to win the war   and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win re election     In addition  although it was not made public at the time  Johnson became more worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another four year term  Therefore  at the end of a March 31 speech  he shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re election by concluding with the line   I shall not seek  and I will not accept  the nomination of my party for another term as your President     The next day  his approval ratings increased from 36  to 49      Historians have debated the factors that led to Johnson s surprise decision  Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication  when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave    Gould says that Johnson had neglected the party  was hurting it by his Vietnam policies  and underestimated McCarthy s strength until the very last minute  when it was too late for Johnson to recover    Woods said Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal    Dallek says that Johnson had no further domestic goals  and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity  His health was not good  and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign  his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink  Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker    Bennett  however  says Johnson   had been forced out of a reelection race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia     Johnson did rally the party bosses and unions to give Humphrey the nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention   Personal correspondences between the President and some in the Republican Party suggested Johnson tacitly supported Nelson Rockefeller  s campaign  He reportedly said that if Rockefeller became the Republican nominee  he would not campaign against him  and would not campaign for Humphrey     In what was termed the October surprise   Johnson announced to the nation on October 31  1968  that he had ordered a complete cessation of  all air  naval and artillery bombardment of North Vietnam    effective November 1  should the Hanoi Government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the Paris peace talks   In the end  Democrats did not fully unite behind Humphrey  enabling Republican candidate Richard Nixon to win the election   Johnson appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States    Johnson in 1965 anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures  and thought it advantageous to have a  mole  in the Supreme Court who he thought could provide him with inside information  as he was able to get from the legislative branch  Abe Fortas in particular was the individual that Johnson thought could fill the bill  The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for Ambassador to the UN  with Adlai Stevenson s death  Associate Justice Arthur Goldenberg accepted Johnson s offer to transfer to the position  Only Johnson s insistence  as well as a slight of hand  in Fortas  assuming Goldberg s seat  could overcome Fortas  wife s objection  that it was too early in his career  Mrs  Fortas expressed unparalleled disapproval to Johnson personally afterwards    When Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968  Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as Chief Justice of the United States   and nominated Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas as Associate Justice  However  Fortas s nomination was filibustered by senators and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate   In addition to his Supreme Court appointments  Johnson appointed 40 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 126 judges to the United States district courts   Johnson also had a small number of judicial appointment controversies   with one appellate and three district court nominees not being confirmed by the United States Senate before Johnson s presidency ended   Johnson continued the FBI s wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr  that had been previously authorized by the Kennedy administration under Attorney General Robert Kennedy     As a result of listening to the FBI s tapes  remarks on King s extra marital activities were made by several prominent officials  including Johnson  who once said that King was a  hypocritical preacher     Johnson also authorized the tapping of phone conversations of others  including the Vietnamese friends of a Nixon associate     According to biographer Radall Woods  Johnson posed in many different roles  Depending on the circumstances  he could be   Other historians have noted how he played additional roles  as Kent Germany reports   Johnson was often seen as a wildly ambitious  tireless  and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed  He worked 1820 hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities   There was no more powerful majority leader in American history   biographer Robert Dallek writes  Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators  knew what their ambitions  hopes  and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes  Another Johnson biographer noted   He could get up every day and learn what their fears  their desires  their wishes  their wants were and he could then manipulate  dominate  persuade and cajole them   At 6feet 3 5inches  1 918m  tall        Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion  known as  The Johnson Treatment     A contemporary writes   It was an incredible blend of badgering  cajolery  reminders of past favors  promises of future favors  predictions of gloom if something doesn t happen  When that man started to work on you  all of a sudden  you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you      Johnson s cowboy hat and boots reflected his Texas roots and genuine love of the rural hill country  From 250 acres  100ha  of land that he was given by an aunt in 1951  he created a 2 700 acre  1 100ha  working ranch with 400 head of registered Hereford cattle  The National Park Service keeps a herd of Hereford cattle descended from Johnson s registered herd and maintains the ranch property     Biographer Randall Woods argues that Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems  This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice  as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality  The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign policy approach to a sort of Christian internationalism and nation building  For example  in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church issued in 1940  adding   It would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal      After leaving the presidency in January 1969  Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall  Texas  accompanied by former aide and speech writer Harry J  Middleton   who would draft Johnson s first book  The Choices We Face  and work with him on his memoirs entitled The Vantage Point  Perspectives of the Presidency 19631969  published in 1971    That year  the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum opened on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin   He donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the Lyndon B  Johnson National Historical Park   with the provision that the ranch  remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past      Johnson gave Nixon  high grades  in foreign policy  but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing U S  forces too quickly  before the South Vietnamese were really able to defend themselves   If the South falls to the Communists  we can have a serious backlash here at home   he warned     During the 1972 presidential election   Johnson endorsed Democratic presidential nominee George S  McGovern   a Senator from South Dakota   although McGovern had long opposed Johnson s foreign and defense policies  The McGovern nomination and presidential platform dismayed him  Nixon could be defeated  if only the Democrats don t go too far left   he had insisted  Johnson had felt Edmund Muskie would be more likely to defeat Nixon  however  he declined an invitation to try to stop McGovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the Democratic party was such that anything he said was more likely to help McGovern  Johnson s protg John Connally had served as President Nixon s Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head   Democrats for Nixon    a group funded by Republicans  It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign     In March 1970  Johnson suffered an attack of angina and was taken to Brooke Army General Hospital on Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio   He was urged to lose considerable weight  He had grown dangerously heavier since leaving the White House  gaining more than 25 pounds  11kg  and weighing around 235 pounds  107kg   He had also resumed smoking after nearly fifteen years without having done so  which contributed further to his health issues  The following summer  again gripped by chest pains  he embarked on a crash water diet  shedding about 15 pounds  6 8kg  in less than a month  In April 1972  Johnson fell victim to a second heart attack while visiting his daughter  Lynda  in Charlottesville  Virginia   I m hurting real bad   he confided to friends  The chest pains hit him nearly every afternoona series of sharp  jolting pains that left him scared and breathless  A portable oxygen tank stood next to his bed  and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask to gulp air  He continued to smoke heavily  and  although placed on a low calorie  low cholesterol diet  kept to it only in fits and starts  Meanwhile  he began experiencing severe stomach pains  Doctors diagnosed this problem as diverticulosis   pouches forming on the intestine  His condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended  so Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Dr  Michael DeBakey   DeBakey discovered that even though two of the former President s coronary arteries were critically damaged  the overall condition of his heart was so poor that even attempting a bypass surgery would likely result in fatal complications     On Inauguration Day  January 20  1969   Johnson saw Nixon sworn in  then got on the plane to fly back to Texas  When the front door of the plane closed  Johnson pulled out a cigarettehis first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955  One of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said   Daddy  what are you doing  You re going to kill yourself   He took it back and said   I ve now raised you girls  I ve now been President  Now it s my time    From that point on  he went into a very self destructive spiral   With his condition now diagnosed as terminal  Johnson returned home to his ranch  At approximately 3 39pm Central Time on January 22  1973  Johnson placed a call to the ranch s Secret Service compound complaining of  massive chest pains   The agents rushed to the former President s bedroom  finding him unresponsive with the phone receiver still in his hand  Johnson was airlifted in one of his own airplanes to San Antonio and taken to Brooke Army General  where he was pronounced dead on arrival at the facility by cardiologist and Army colonel Dr  George McGranahan     Johnson  who died two days after Richard Nixon s second inauguration  was the second former President to die within the span of two months at the time of his death  Former President Harry S  Truman   whose death made Johnson the only living former President  died less than a month before Johnson did  on December 26  1972  Johnson s death left the United States with no living former presidents  he and Truman had been the only two since Dwight Eisenhower  s death in 1969   Shortly after Johnson s death  his press secretary Tom Johnson  no relation  telephoned Walter Cronkite at CBS  Cronkite was live on the air with the CBS Evening News at the time  and a report on Vietnam was cut abruptly while Cronkite was still on the line  so he could break the news     Johnson was honored with a state funeral in which Texas Congressman J  J  Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him at the Capitol     The final services took place on January 25  The funeral was held at the National City Christian Church in Washington  D C   where he had often worshiped as president  The service was presided over by President Richard Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries  led by former Japanese prime minister Eisaku Sat    who served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson s presidency    Eulogies were given by the Rev  Dr  George Davis  the church s pastor  and W  Marvin Watson   former postmaster general    Nixon did not speak  though he attended  as is customary for presidents during state funerals  but the eulogists turned to him and lauded him for his tributes    as Rusk did the day before  as Nixon mentioned Johnson s death in a speech he gave the day after Johnson died  announcing the peace agreement to end the Vietnam War     Johnson was buried in his family cemetery  which  although it is part of the Lyndon B  Johnson National Historical Park in Stonewall  Texas  is still privately owned by the Johnson family  who have requested that the public not enter the cemetery   a few yards from the house in which he was born  Eulogies were given by John Connally and the Rev  Billy Graham   the minister who officiated the burial rites  The state funeral  the last for a president until Ronald Reagan  s in 2004  was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington  as the Military District of Washington  MDW  dealt with their second major task in less than a week  beginning with Nixon s second inauguration     The inauguration had an impact on the state funeral in various ways  because Johnson died only two days after the inauguration      The MDW and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration to allow for a full state funeral    and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral    It also meant Johnson s casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol  entering through the Senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exited through the House wing steps due to construction on the East Front steps     The Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston was renamed the Lyndon B  Johnson Space Center in 1973    and Texas created a legal state holiday to be observed on August 27 to mark Johnson s birthday    It is known as Lyndon Baines Johnson Day   The Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac was dedicated on September 27  1974   The Lyndon B  Johnson School of Public Affairs was named in his honor  as is the Lyndon B  Johnson National Grassland    Lyndon B  Johnson Middle School in Melbourne  Florida   is his namesake   LBJ Elementary in Jackson  Kentucky is named for him   Interstate 635 in Dallas is named the Lyndon B  Johnson Freeway   Lyndon Baines Johnson Tropical Medical Center is named after the 36th President who visited American Samoa on October 18  1966  This marked the beginning of construction of the hospital located in the village of Faga alu  American Samoa   The facility was completed in 1968   Runway 17R 35L at Austin Bergstrom International Airport is known as the Lyndon B  Johnson Runway   The student center at Texas State University is named after the former president and graduate   Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1980     A small village run by FELDA in Negeri Sembilan has been named FELDA L B  Johnson to commemorate his visit to Malaysia in 1966   On March 23  2007  President George W  Bush signed legislation naming the United States Department of Education headquarters after President Johnson    ", "Hayes": "Family and early life Childhood and family history Education and early law career Cincinnati law

Hayes  October 4  1822 January 17  1893  was the 19th President of the United States  18771881   As president  he oversaw the end of Reconstruction   began the efforts that led to civil service reform  and attempted to reconcile the divisions left over from the Civil War and Reconstruction   Hayes  an attorney in Ohio  became city solicitor of Cincinnati from 1858 to 1861  When the Civil War began  he left a fledgling political career to join the Union Army as an officer  Hayes was wounded five times  most seriously at the Battle of South Mountain   he earned a reputation for bravery in combat and was promoted to the rank of major general  After the war  he served in the U S  Congress from 1865 to 1867 as a Republican   Hayes left Congress to run for Governor of Ohio and was elected to two consecutive terms  from 1868 to 1872  and then to a third term  from 1876 to 1877   In 1876  Hayes was elected president in one of the most contentious and confused elections in national history  He lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel J  Tilden but he won an intensely disputed electoral college vote after a Congressional commission awarded him twenty contested electoral votes  The result was the Compromise of 1877   in which the Democrats acquiesced to Hayes s election and Hayes ended all U S  military involvement in Southern politics   Hayes believed in meritocratic government  equal treatment without regard to race  and improvement through education  He ordered federal troops to crush the Great Railroad Strike of 1877   He implemented modest civil service reforms that laid the groundwork for further reform in the 1880s and 1890s  He vetoed the BlandAllison Act   which would have put silver money into circulation and raised prices  insisting that maintenance of the gold standard was essential to economic recovery  His policy toward Western Indians anticipated the assimilationist program of the Dawes Act of 1887   Hayes kept his pledge not to run for re election  retired to his home in Ohio  and became an advocate of social and educational reform  Biographer Ari Hoogenboom says his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln s death   Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights  Hayes is generally listed among the bottom half in historians  rankings of U S  presidents     Rutherford Birchard Hayes was born in Delaware  Ohio   on October 4  1822  the son of Rutherford Hayes  Jr  and Sophia Birchard  Hayes s father  a Vermont storekeeper  took the family to Ohio in 1817  He died ten weeks before Rutherford s birth  Sophia took charge of the family  bringing up Hayes and his sister  Fanny  the only two of their four children to survive to adulthood    She never remarried    Sophia s younger brother  Sardis Birchard  lived with the family for a time    He was always close to Hayes and became a father figure to him  contributing to his early education     Through both his father and mother  Hayes was of New England colonial ancestry    His earliest American ancestor emigrated to Connecticut from Scotland in 1625    Hayes s great grandfather  Ezekiel Hayes  was a militia captain in Connecticut in the American Revolutionary War   but Ezekiel s son  Hayes s grandfather  also named Rutherford  left his New Haven home during the war for the relative peace of Vermont    His mother s ancestors arrived in Vermont at a similar time  and most of his close relatives outside Ohio continued to live there  John Noyes   an uncle by marriage  had been his father s business partner in Vermont and was later elected to Congress    His first cousin  Mary Jane Noyes Mead  was the mother of sculptor Larkin Goldsmith Mead and architect William Rutherford Mead     John Humphrey Noyes   the founder of the Oneida Community   was also a first cousin    Hayes  grandnephew was character actor Grant Mitchell     He became a member of the Sons of the American Revolution based on his descent from Daniel Austin and Elias Birchard   Hayes attended the common schools in Delaware  Ohio  and enrolled in 1836 at the Methodist Norwalk Seminary in Norwalk  Ohio     He did well at Norwalk  and the following year transferred to a preparatory school in Middletown   Connecticut  where he studied Latin and Ancient Greek     Returning to Ohio  Hayes entered Kenyon College in Gambier in 1838    He enjoyed his time at Kenyon  and was successful scholastically    while there  he joined several student societies and became interested in Whig politics    He graduated with highest honors in 1842 and addressed the class as its valedictorian      After briefly reading law in Columbus   Ohio  Hayes moved east to attend Harvard Law School in 1843    Graduating with an LL B   he was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1845 and opened his own law office in Lower Sandusky  now Fremont      Business was slow at first  but he gradually attracted a few clients and also represented his uncle Sardis in real estate litigation    In 1847  Hayes became ill with what his doctor thought to be tuberculosis   Thinking a change in climate would help  he considered enlisting in the MexicanAmerican War   but on his doctor s advice he instead visited family in New England    Returning from there  Hayes and his uncle Sardis made a long journey to Texas   where Hayes visited with Guy M  Bryan   a Kenyon classmate and distant relative    Business remained meager on his return to Lower Sandusky  and Hayes decided to move to Cincinnati      Hayes moved to Cincinnati in 1850  and opened a law office with John W  Herron  a lawyer from Chillicothe       a   Later  Herron joined a more established firm and Hayes formed a new partnership with William K  Rogers and Richard M  Corwine    He found business better in Cincinnati  and enjoyed the social attractions of the larger city  joining the Cincinnati Literary Society and the Odd Fellows Club     He also attended the Episcopal Church in Cincinnati but did not become a member     Hayes courted his future wife  Lucy Webb   during his time there    His mother had encouraged him to get to know Lucy years earlier  but Hayes had believed she was too young and focused his attention on other women    Four years later  Hayes began to spend more time with Lucy  They became engaged in 1851 and married on December 30  1852  at the house of Lucy s mother    Over the next five years  Lucy gave birth to three sons  Birchard Austin  1853   Webb Cook  1856   and Rutherford Platt  1858     Lucy  a Methodist   was a teetotaler and abolitionist   She influenced her husband s views on those issues  although he never formally joined her church     Hayes had begun his law practice dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati as a criminal defense attorney    defending several people accused of murder    In one case  he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows   the woman was instead confined to a mental institution    Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850     As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky   a slave state  it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts  A staunch abolitionist  Hayes found his work on behalf of fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful  as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican party      His political reputation rose with his professional plaudits  Hayes declined the Republican nomination for a judgeship in 1856    Two years later  some Republicans proposed Hayes to fill a vacancy on the bench and he considered accepting the appointment until the office of city solicitor also became vacant    The city council elected Hayes as city solicitor to fill the vacancy  and he won a full two year term from the voters in April 1859 with a larger majority than other Republicans on the ticket      As the Southern states started to secede after Lincoln  s election to the Presidency in 1860  Hayes was lukewarm on the idea of a civil war to restore the Union  Considering that the two sides might be irreconcilable  he suggested that the Union   l et them go     Although Ohio had voted for Lincoln in 1860  the Cincinnati voters turned against the Republican party after secession  Its residents included many from the South  and they voted for the Democrats and Know Nothings   who combined to sweep the city elections in April 1861  ejecting Hayes from the city solicitor s office     Returning to private practice  Hayes formed a very brief law partnership with Leopold Markbreit   lasting three days before the war began    After the Confederates had fired on Fort Sumter   Hayes resolved his doubts and joined a volunteer company composed of his Literary Society friends    That June  Governor William Dennison appointed several of the officers of the volunteer company to positions in the 23rd Regiment of Ohio Volunteer Infantry   Hayes was promoted to major   and his friend and college classmate Stanley Matthews was appointed lieutenant colonel     Joining the regiment as a private was William McKinley   another future president     After a month of training  Hayes and the 23rd Ohio set out for western Virginia in July 1861 as a part of the Kanawha Division     They passed the next few months out of contact with the enemy until September  when the regiment encountered Confederates at Carnifex Ferry in present day West Virginia and drove them back    In November  Hayes was promoted to lieutenant colonel  Matthews having been promoted to colonel of another regiment  and led his troops deeper into western Virginia  where they entered winter quarters    The division resumed its advance the following spring  and Hayes led several raids against the rebel forces  on one of which he sustained a minor injury to his knee    That September  Hayes s regiment was called east to reinforce General John Pope  s Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run     Although Hayes and his troops did not arrive in time for the battle  they joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E  Lee  s Army of Northern Virginia   which was advancing into Maryland     Marching north  the 23rd was the lead regiment encountering the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14    Hayes led a charge against an entrenched position and was shot through his left arm  fracturing the bone    He had one of his men tie a handkerchief above the wound in an effort to stop the bleeding  and continued to lead his men in the battle  While resting  he ordered his men to meet a flanking attack  but instead his entire command moved backward  leaving Hayes lying in between the lines   Eventually  his men brought Hayes back behind their lines  and he was taken to hospital  The regiment continued on to Antietam   but Hayes was out of action for the rest of the campaign    In October  he was promoted to colonel and assigned to command of the first brigade of the Kanawha Division as a brevet brigadier general      The division spent the following winter and spring near Charleston  Virginia  present day West Virginia   out of contact with the enemy    Hayes saw little action until July 1863  when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan  s cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island     Returning to Charleston for the rest of the summer  Hayes spent the fall encouraging the men of the 23rd Ohio to re enlist  and many did so    In 1864  the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized  and Hayes s division was assigned to George Crook  s Army of West Virginia     Advancing into southwestern Virginia  they destroyed Confederate salt and lead mines there    On May 9  they engaged Confederate troops at Cloyd s Mountain   where Hayes and his men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field    Following the rout  the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and again successfully skirmished with the enemy     Hayes and his brigade moved to the Shenandoah Valley for the Valley Campaigns of 1864   Crook s corps was attached to Major General David Hunter  s Army of the Shenandoah and soon back in contact with Confederate forces  capturing Lexington  Virginia on June 11    They continued south toward Lynchburg   tearing up railroad track as they advanced    Hunter believed the troops at Lynchburg were too powerful  however  and Hayes and his brigade returned to West Virginia    Hayes thought that Hunter lacked aggression  writing in a letter home that  General Crook would have taken Lynchburg     Before the army could make another attempt  Confederate General Jubal Early  s raid into Maryland forced their recall to the north  Early s army surprised them at Kernstown on July 24  where Hayes was slightly wounded by a bullet to the shoulder    Hayes also had a horse shot out from under him  and the army was defeated    Retreating into Maryland  the army was reorganized again  with Major General Philip Sheridan replacing Hunter    By August  Early was retreating up the valley  with Sheridan in pursuit  Hayes s troops fended off a Confederate assault at Berryville and advanced to Opequon Creek   where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south    They followed up the victory with another at Fisher s Hill on September 22  and one more at Cedar Creek on October 19    At Cedar Creek  Hayes sprained his ankle after being thrown from a horse and was struck in the head by a spent round  which did not cause serious damage    Hayes s leadership and bravery drew the attention of his superiors  with Ulysses S  Grant later writing of Hayes that   h is conduct on the field was marked by conspicuous gallantry as well as the display of qualities of a higher order than that of mere personal daring      Cedar Creek marked the end of the campaign  Hayes was promoted to brigadier general in October 1864 and brevetted major general     Around this time  Hayes learned of the birth of his son  George Crook Hayes  The army went into winter quarters once more  and in spring 1865 the war quickly came to a close with Lee s surrender to Grant at Appomattox  Hayes visited Washington  D C  that May and observed the Grand Review of the Armies   after which he and the 23rd Ohio returned to their home state to be mustered out of the service     While serving in the Army of the Shenandoah in 1864  Hayes was nominated by Republicans to run for the House of Representatives from Ohio s 2nd congressional district     Asked by friends in Cincinnati to leave the army to campaign  Hayes refused  saying that an  officer fit for duty who at this crisis would abandon his post to electioneer for a seat in Congress ought to be scalped     Instead  Hayes wrote several letters to the voters explaining his political positions and was elected by a 2 400 vote majority over the incumbent Democrat Alexander Long      When the 39th Congress assembled in December 1865  Hayes was sworn in as a part of a large Republican majority  Hayes identified with the moderate wing of the party  but was willing to vote with the radicals for the sake of party unity    The major legislative effort of the Congress was the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution   for which Hayes voted and which passed both houses of Congress in June 1866    Hayes s beliefs were in line with his fellow Republicans on Reconstruction issues  that the South should be restored to the Union  but not without adequate protections for freedmen and other black southerners    President Andrew Johnson   who succeeded to office following Lincoln s assassination  to the contrary wanted to readmit the seceded states quickly without first ensuring that they adopted laws protecting the newly freed slaves  civil rights  he also granted pardons to many of the leading former Confederates    Hayes  along with congressional Republicans  disagreed  They worked to reject Johnson s vision of Reconstruction and to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1866      Re elected in 1866  Hayes returned to the lame duck session to vote for the Tenure of Office Act   which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate s consent    He also unsuccessfully pressed for a civil service reform bill that attracted the votes of many reform minded Republicans    Hayes continued to vote with the majority in the 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts   but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio     A popular Congressman and former Army officer  Hayes was considered by Ohio Republicans to be an excellent standard bearer for the 1867 election campaign    Hayes s political views were more moderate than the Republican party s platform  although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to black Ohioans    Hayes s opponent  Allen G  Thurman   made the proposed amendment the centerpiece of the campaign  and both men campaigned vigorously  making speeches across the state  mostly focusing on the suffrage question    The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans  as the amendment failed to pass and Democrats gained a majority in the state legislature     Hayes thought at first that he  too  had lost  but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2 983 votes of 484 603 votes cast     As a Republican governor with a Democratic legislature  Hayes had a limited role in governing  especially since Ohio s governor had no veto power  Despite these constraints  Hayes oversaw the establishment of a school for deaf mutes and a reform school for girls    He endorsed the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson and urged his conviction  which failed by one vote in the United States Senate    Nominated for a second term in 1869  Hayes campaigned again for equal rights for black Ohioans and sought to associate his Democratic opponent  George H  Pendleton with disunion and racism     Hayes was re elected with an increased majority  and the Republicans took the legislature  ensuring Ohio s ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution   which guaranteed black suffrage    With a Republican legislature  Hayes s second term was more enjoyable  Suffrage was expanded and a state Agricultural and Mechanical College  later to become The Ohio State University   established    He also proposed a reduction in state taxes and reform of the state prison system    Choosing not to seek re election  Hayes looked forward to retiring from politics in 1872     As Hayes prepared to leave office  several delegations of reform minded Republicans urged him to run against the incumbent Republican  John Sherman   for United States Senate     Hayes declined the offers  preferring to preserve party unity and retire to private life    Hayes especially looked forward to spending time with his children  two of whom  daughter Fanny and son Scott  had been born in the past five years      b   Initially  Hayes tried to promote railway extensions to his hometown  Fremont  He also managed some real estate he had acquired in Duluth  Minnesota     Not entirely removed from politics  Hayes held out some hope of a cabinet appointment  but was disappointed to receive only an appointment as assistant U S  treasurer at Cincinnati  which he turned down    He agreed to be nominated for his old House seat in 1872 but was not disappointed when he lost the election to Henry B  Banning   a fellow Kenyon College alumnus    In 1873  Lucy gave birth to another son  Manning Force Hayes      c   That same year  the Panic of 1873 hurt business prospects across the nation  including Hayes s  Sardis Birchard died that year and the Hayes family moved into Spiegel Grove   the grand house Birchard had built with them in mind     Hayes hoped to remain out of politics in order to pay off the debts he had incurred during the Panic  but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875  he accepted    The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears of the possibility of state aid to Catholic schools     Hayes was against such funding and  while he was not known to be personally anti Catholic   he allowed anti Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy    The campaign was a success  and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5 544 vote majority     Hayes s success in Ohio immediately elevated him to the top ranks of Republican politicians under consideration for the presidency in 1876    The Ohio delegation to the 1876 Republican National Convention was united behind him  and Senator John Sherman did all in his power to bring Hayes the nomination    In June 1876  the convention assembled with James G  Blaine of Maine as the favorite    Blaine started with a significant lead in the delegate count but could not muster a majority  As he failed to gain votes  the delegates looked elsewhere for a nominee and settled on Hayes on the seventh ballot    The convention then selected Representative William A  Wheeler of New York for Vice President  a man about whom Hayes had recently asked   I am ashamed to say  who is Wheeler      The Democratic nominee was Samuel J  Tilden   the Governor of New York  Tilden was considered a formidable adversary who  like Hayes  had a reputation for honesty    Also like Hayes  Tilden was a hard money man and supported civil service reform    In accordance with the custom of the time  the campaign was conducted by surrogates  with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns    The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election    Both candidates focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana   as well as the three southern states Louisiana   South Carolina   and Florida where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled  amid recurring political violence    The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and  to a lesser extent  the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks    Democrats  for their part  trumpeted Tilden s record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration      As the returns were tallied on election day  it was clear that the race was close  Democrats had carried most of the South  as well as New York  Indiana  Connecticut   and New Jersey     In the Northeast  an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic  The popular vote also favored Tilden  but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states  they would emerge with an electoral college majority     On November 11  three days after election day  Tilden appeared to have won 184 electoral votes  one short of a majority    Hayes appeared to have 166 votes  with the 19 votes of Florida  Louisiana  and South Carolina still in doubt    Republicans and Democrats each claimed victory in the three latter states  but the results in those states were rendered uncertain because of fraud by both parties    To further complicate matters  one of the three electors from Oregon  a state Hayes had won  was disqualified  reducing Hayes s total to 165  and raising the disputed votes to 20      d   If either candidate could be awarded the 20 disputed votes  he would be elected president   There was considerable debate about which person or house of Congress was authorized to decide between the competing slates of electors  with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority    By January 1877  with the question still unresolved  Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission   which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes    The Commission was to be made up of five representatives   five senators   and five Supreme Court justices     To ensure partisan balance  there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans  with Justice David Davis   an independent respected by both parties  as the fifteenth member    The balance was upset when Democrats in the Illinois legislature elected Davis to the Senate  hoping to sway his vote    Davis disappointed Democrats by refusing to serve on the Commission because of his election to the Senate    As all of the remaining Justices were Republicans  Justice Joseph P  Bradley   believed to be the most independent minded of them  was selected to take Davis s place on the Commission    The Commission met in February and the eight Republicans voted to award all 20 electoral votes to Hayes    Democrats were outraged by the result and attempted a filibuster to prevent Congress from accepting the Commission s findings     As the March 4 inauguration day neared  Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders met at Wormley s Hotel in Washington to negotiate a compromise   Republicans promised concessions in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the Committee s decision  The primary concession Hayes promised would be the withdrawal of federal troops from the South and an acceptance of the election of Democratic governments in the remaining  unredeemed  states of the South    The Democrats agreed  and on March 2  the filibuster was ended  Hayes was elected  but Reconstruction was finished     Because March 4  1877 fell on a Sunday  Hayes took the oath of office privately on Saturday  March 3  in the Red Room of the White House   the first president to do so in the Executive Mansion  He took the oath publicly on the following Monday on the East Portico of the United States Capitol     In his inaugural address  Hayes attempted to soothe the passions of the past few months  saying that  he serves his party best who serves his country best     He pledged to support  wise  honest  and peaceful local self government  in the South  as well as reform of the civil service and a full return to the gold standard     Despite his message of conciliation  many Democrats never considered Hayes s election legitimate and referred to him as  Rutherfraud  or  His Fraudulency  for the next four years     Hayes had been a firm supporter of Republican Reconstruction policies throughout his political career  but the first major act of his presidency was an end to Reconstruction and the return of the South to  home rule     Even without the conditions of the Wormley s Hotel agreement  Hayes would have been hard pressed to continue the policies of his predecessors  The House of Representatives in the 45th Congress was controlled by a majority of Democrats that refused to appropriate enough funds for the army to continue to garrison the South    Even among Republicans  devotion to continued military Reconstruction was fading in the face of persistent Southern insurgency and violence    Only two states were still under Reconstruction s sway when Hayes assumed the Presidency and  without troops to enforce the voting rights laws  these soon fell      e    Hayes s later attempts to protect the rights of southern blacks were ineffective  as were his attempts to rebuild Republican strength in the South    He did  however  defeat Congress s efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections    Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Force Acts   which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan     Those Acts  passed during Reconstruction  made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race  Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters  and he vetoed the appropriation    The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto  but they passed a new bill with the same rider  Hayes vetoed this as well  and the process was repeated three times more    Finally  Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider  but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals  who were vital to the enforcement of the Force Acts    The election laws remained in effect  but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being     Hayes tried to reconcile the social mores of the South with the recently passed civil rights laws by distributing patronage among southern Democrats   My task was to wipe out the color line  to abolish sectionalism  to end the war and bring peace   he wrote in his diary   To do this  I was ready to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation within my party and the country     All of his efforts were in vain  Hayes failed to convince the South to accept the idea of racial equality and failed to convince Congress to appropriate funds to enforce the civil rights laws      Hayes took office determined to reform the system of civil service appointments  which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president    Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters  Hayes wished to award them by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take    Immediately  Hayes s call for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart   or pro spoils  branch of the Republican party  Senators of both parties were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments and turned against Hayes  Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling   who fought Hayes s reform efforts at every turn     To show his commitment to reform  Hayes appointed one of the best known advocates of reform  Carl Schurz   to be Secretary of the Interior and asked Schurz and William M  Evarts   his Secretary of State   to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments    John Sherman   the Treasury Secretary   ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House   which was stacked with Conkling s spoilsmen    Jay s report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20  of the employees were expendable     Although he could not convince Congress to outlaw the spoils system  Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics    Chester A  Arthur   the Collector of the Port of New York   and his subordinates Alonzo B  Cornell and George H  Sharpe   all Conkling supporters  refused to obey the president s order    In September 1877  Hayes demanded the three men s resignations  which they refused to give  He submitted appointments of Theodore Roosevelt  Sr    L  Bradford Prince   and Edwin Merritt all supporters of Evarts  Conkling s New York rivalto the Senate for confirmation as their replacements    The Senate s Commerce Committee  which Conkling chaired  voted unanimously to reject the nominees  and the full Senate rejected Roosevelt and Prince by a vote of 3125  confirming Merritt only because Sharpe s term had expired     Hayes was forced to wait until July 1878 when  during a Congressional recess  he sacked Arthur and Cornell and replaced them by recess appointments of Merritt and Silas W  Burt   respectively      f   Conkling opposed the appointees  confirmation when the Senate reconvened in February 1879  but Merritt was approved by a vote of 3125  as was Burt by 3119  giving Hayes his most significant civil service reform victory    For the remainder of his term  Hayes pressed Congress to enact permanent reform legislation and fund the United States Civil Service Commission   even using his last annual message to Congress in 1880 to appeal for reform  While reform legislation did not pass during Hayes s presidency  his advocacy provided  a significant precedent as well as the political impetus for the Pendleton Act of 1883   which was signed into law by President Chester Arthur    Hayes allowed some exceptions to the ban on assessments  permitting George Congdon Gorham   secretary of the Republican Congressional Committee  to solicit campaign contributions from federal office holders during the Congressional elections of 1878     Hayes also dealt with corruption in the postal service   In 1880  Schurz and Senator John A  Logan asked Hayes to shut down the   star route   rings  a system of corrupt contract profiteering in the Postal Service  and to fire Second Assistant Postmaster General Thomas J  Brady   the alleged ring leader    Hayes stopped granting new star route contracts  but let existing contracts continue to be enforced    Democrats accused Hayes of delaying proper investigation so as not to injure Republican chances in the 1880 elections but did not press the issue in their campaign literature  as members of both parties were implicated in the corruption    As historian Hans L  Trefousse later wrote  Hayes  hardly knew the chief suspect  Brady  and certainly had no connection with the  star route  corruption     Although Hayes and the Congress both investigated the contracts and found no compelling evidence of wrongdoing  Brady and others were indicted for conspiracy in 1882    After two trials  the defendants were found not guilty in 1883     In his first year in office  Hayes was faced with the United States  largest labor disturbance to date  the Great Railroad Strike of 1877     In order to make up for financial losses suffered since the panic of 1873  the major railroads cut their employees  wages several times in 1877    In July of that year  workers from the Baltimore   Ohio Railroad walked off the job in Martinsburg  West Virginia   to protest their reduction in pay    The strike quickly spread to workers of the New York Central   Erie   and Pennsylvania railroads  with the strikers soon numbering in the thousands    Fearing a riot   Governor Henry M  Mathews asked Hayes to send federal troops to Martinsburg  and Hayes did so  but when the troops arrived there was no riot  only a peaceful protest    In Baltimore   however  a riot did erupt on July 20 and Hayes ordered the troops at Fort McHenry to assist the governor in its suppression  by the time they arrived  the riot had dispersed    Pittsburgh next exploded into riots  but Hayes was reluctant to send in troops without the governor first requesting them    Other discontented citizens joined the railroad workers in rioting    After a few days  Hayes resolved to send in troops to protect federal property wherever it appeared to be threatened and gave Major General Winfield Scott Hancock overall command of the situation  marking the first use of federal troops to break a strike against a private company    The riot spread further  to Chicago and St  Louis   where strikers shut down railroad facilities    By July 29  the riots had ended and federal troops returned to their barracks    Although no federal troops had killed any of the strikers  or been killed themselves  clashes between state militia troops and strikers resulted in deaths on both sides    The railroads were victorious in the short term  as the workers returned to their jobs and some wage cuts remained in effect  But  the public blamed the railroads for the strikes and violence  and they were compelled to improve working conditions and make no further cuts    Business leaders praised Hayes  but his own opinion was more equivocal  as he recorded in his diary   The strikes have been put down by force  but now for the real remedy  Can t something  be  done by education of strikers  by judicious control of capitalists  by wise general policy to end or diminish the evil  The railroad strikers  as a rule  are good men  sober  intelligent  and industrious      Hayes confronted two issues regarding the currency   the first of which was the coinage of silver   and its relation to gold   In 1873  the Coinage Act of 1873 stopped the coinage of silver for all coins worth a dollar or more  effectively tying the dollar to the value of gold  As a result  the money supply contracted and the effects of the Panic of 1873 grew worse  making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable    Farmers and laborers  especially  clamored for the return of coinage in both metals  believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values    Democratic Representative Richard P  Bland of Missouri proposed a bill that would require the United States to coin as much silver as miners could sell the government  thus increasing the money supply and aiding debtors    William B  Allison   a Republican from Iowa offered an amendment in the Senate limiting the coinage to two to four million dollars per month  and the resulting BlandAllison Act passed both houses of Congress in 1878    Hayes feared that the Act would cause inflation that would be ruinous to business  effectively impairing contracts that were based on the gold dollar  as the silver dollar proposed in the bill would have an intrinsic value of 90 to 92 percent of the existing gold dollar    Further  Hayes believed that inflating the currency was an act of dishonesty  saying   e xpediency and justice both demand an honest currency     He vetoed the bill  but Congress overrode his veto  the only time it did so during his presidency     The second issue concerned United States Notes  commonly called greenbacks    a form of fiat currency first issued during the Civil War  The government accepted these notes as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs  but unlike ordinary dollars  they were not redeemable in gold    The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold  thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single  gold backed currency    Sherman agreed with Hayes s favorable opinion of the Act  and stockpiled gold in preparation for the exchange of greenbacks for gold    Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for specie  gold   however  few did so  when the Act took effect in 1879  only  130 000 out of the  346 000 000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed    Together with the BlandAllison Act  the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men and  as the world economy began to improve  agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes s term in office     Most of Hayes s foreign policy concerns involved Latin America   In 1878  following the Paraguayan War   he arbitrated a territorial dispute between Argentina and Paraguay     Hayes awarded the disputed land in the Gran Chaco region to Paraguay  and the Paraguayans honored him by renaming a city   Villa Hayes   and a department   Presidente Hayes   in his honor    Hayes was also perturbed over the plans of Ferdinand de Lesseps   the builder of the Suez Canal   to construct a canal across the Isthmus of Panama   which was then owned by Colombia     Concerned about a repetition of French adventurism in Mexico   Hayes interpreted the Monroe Doctrine firmly    In a message to Congress  Hayes explained his opinion on the canal   The policy of this country is a canal under American control    The United States cannot consent to the surrender of this control to any European power or any combination of European powers      The Mexican border also drew Hayes s attention  Throughout the 1870s   lawless bands  often crossed the border on raids into Texas    Three months after taking office  Hayes granted the Army the power to pursue bandits   even if it required crossing into Mexican territory    Porfirio Daz   the Mexican president  protested the order and sent troops to the border    The situation calmed as Daz and Hayes agreed to jointly pursue bandits and Hayes agreed not to allow Mexican revolutionaries to raise armies in the United States    The violence along the border decreased  and in 1880 Hayes revoked the order allowing pursuit into Mexico     Outside of the Western hemisphere  Hayes s biggest foreign policy concern dealt with China   In 1868  the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China  allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country  As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873   Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen s wages    During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877  anti Chinese riots broke out in San Francisco   and a third party   the Workingman s Party   was formed with an emphasis on stopping Chinese immigration    In response  Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879  abrogating the 1868 treaty    Hayes vetoed the bill  believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation    The veto drew praise among eastern liberals  but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West    In the subsequent furor  Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him  but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote    After the veto  Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W  Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration  and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so    Congress passed a new law to that effect  the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882  after Hayes left office     Interior Secretary Carl Schurz carried out Hayes s American Indian policy  beginning with preventing the War Department from taking over the Bureau of Indian Affairs     Hayes and Schurz carried out a policy that included assimilation into white culture  educational training  and dividing Indian land into individual household allotments    Hayes believed that his policies would lead to self sufficiency and peace between Indians and whites    The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time  including Schurz  but instead proved detrimental to American Indians  They lost much of their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators     Hayes and Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations     Hayes dealt with several conflicts with Indian tribes  The Nez Perce   led by Chief Joseph   began an uprising in June 1877 when Major General Oliver O  Howard ordered them to move on to a reservation     Howard s men defeated the Nez Perce in battle  and the tribe began a 1700 mile retreat into Canada     In October  after a decisive battle at Bear Paw   Montana   Chief Joseph surrendered and General William T  Sherman ordered the tribe transported to Kansas   where they were forced to remain until 1885    The Nez Perce war was not the last conflict in the West  as the Bannock rose up in Spring 1878 and raided nearby settlements before being defeated by Howard s army in July of that year    War with the Ute tribe broke out in 1879 when the Utes killed Indian agent Nathan Meeker   who had been attempting to convert them to Christianity    The subsequent White River War ended when Schurz negotiated peace with the Ute and prevented the white Coloradans from taking revenge for Meeker s death     Hayes also became involved in resolving the removal of the Ponca tribe from Nebraska to Indian Territory  present day Oklahoma   because of a misunderstanding during the Grant Administration    The tribe s problems came to Hayes s attention after their chief  Standing Bear   filed a lawsuit to contest Schurz s demand that they stay in Indian Territory  Overruling Schurz  Hayes set up a commission in 1880 that ruled Ponca were free to return to Nebraska or stay on their reservation in Indian Territory    The Ponca were awarded compensation for their land rights  which had been previously granted to the Sioux     In a message to Congress in February 1881  Hayes insisted he would  give to these injured people that measure of redress which is required alike by justice and by humanity      Hayes and his wife Lucy were known for their policy of keeping an alcohol free White House  giving rise to her nickname  Lemonade Lucy     The first reception at the Hayes White House included wine     However  Hayes was dismayed at drunken behavior at receptions hosted by ambassadors around Washington  leading him to follow his wife s temperance leanings    Alcohol was not served again in the Hayes White House  Critics charged Hayes with parsimony  but Hayes spent more money  which came out of his personal budget  after the ban  ordering that any savings from eliminating alcohol be used on more lavish entertainment    His temperance policy also paid political dividends  strengthening his support among Protestant ministers    Although Secretary Evarts quipped that at the White House dinners   water flowed like wine   the policy was a success in convincing prohibitionists to vote Republican     Hayes appointed two Associate Justices to the Supreme Court   The first vacancy occurred when David Davis resigned to enter the Senate during the election controversy of 1876  On taking office  Hayes appointed John Marshall Harlan to the seat  A former candidate for governor of Kentucky  Harlan had been Benjamin Bristow  s campaign manager at the 1876 Republican convention  and Hayes had earlier considered him for Attorney General     Hayes submitted the nomination in October 1877  but it aroused some dissent in the Senate because of Harlan s limited experience in public office    Harlan was nonetheless confirmed and served on the court for thirty four years  in which he voted  usually in the minority  for an aggressive enforcement of the civil rights laws    In 1880  a second seat became vacant upon the resignation of Justice William Strong   Hayes nominated William Burnham Woods   a carpetbagger Republican circuit court judge from Alabama     Woods served six years on the Court  ultimately proving a disappointment to Hayes as he interpreted the Constitution in a manner more similar to that of Southern Democrats than to Hayes s own preferences     Hayes attempted  unsuccessfully  to fill a third vacancy in 1881  Justice Noah Haynes Swayne resigned with the expectation that Hayes would fill his seat by appointing Stanley Matthews   who was a friend of both men    Many Senators objected to the appointment  believing that Matthews was too close to corporate and railroad interests  especially those of Jay Gould     and the Senate adjourned without voting on the nomination    The following year  when James A  Garfield entered the White House  he re submitted Matthews s nomination to the Senate  which this time confirmed Matthews by one vote  24 to 23    Matthews served for eight years until his death in 1889  His opinion in Yick Wo v  Hopkins in 1886 advanced his and Hayes  views on the protection of ethnic minorities  rights     Hayes declined to seek re election in 1880   keeping his pledge that he would not run for a second term  He was gratified with the election of fellow Ohio Republican James A  Garfield to succeed him  and consulted with him on appointments for the next administration    After Garfield s inauguration  Hayes and his family returned to Spiegel Grove     In 1881  he was elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States   He served as commander in chief  national president  of the Loyal Legion from 1888 until his death in 1893  Although he remained a loyal Republican  Hayes was not too disappointed in Grover Cleveland  s election to the Presidency in 1884  approving of the New York Democrat s views on civil service reform    He was also pleased at the progress of the political career of William McKinley   his army comrade and political protg     Hayes became an advocate for educational charities  advocating federal education subsidies for all children    He believed that education was the best way to heal the rifts in American society and allow individuals to improve themselves    Hayes was appointed to the Board of Trustees of The Ohio State University   the school he helped found during his time as governor of Ohio  in 1887    He emphasized the need for vocational   as well as academic  education   I preach the gospel of work   he wrote   I believe in skilled labor as a part of education     He urged Congress  unsuccessfully  to pass a bill written by Senator Henry W  Blair that would have allowed federal aid for education for the first time    Hayes gave a speech in 1889 encouraging black students to apply for scholarships from the Slater Fund   one of the charities with which he was affiliated    One such student  W  E  B  Du Bois   received a scholarship in 1892    Hayes also advocated better prison conditions      In retirement  Hayes was troubled by the disparity between the rich and the poor  saying in an 1886 speech that  free government cannot long endure if property is largely in a few hands and large masses of people are unable to earn homes  education  and a support in old age     The following year  Hayes recorded his thoughts on that subject in his diary   In church it occurred to me that it is time for the public to hear that the giant evil and danger in this country  the danger which transcends all others  is the vast wealth owned or controlled by a few persons  Money is power  In Congress  in state legislatures  in city councils  in the courts  in the political conventions  in the press  in the pulpit  in the circles of the educated and the talented  its influence is growing greater and greater  Excessive wealth in the hands of the few means extreme poverty  ignorance  vice  and wretchedness as the lot of the many  It is not yet time to debate about the remedy  The previous question is as to the dangerthe evil  Let the people be fully informed and convinced as to the evil  Let them earnestly seek the remedy and it will be found  Fully to know the evil is the first step towards reaching its eradication  Henry George is strong when he portrays the rottenness of the present system  We are  to say the least  not yet ready for his remedy  We may reach and remove the difficulty by changes in the laws regulating corporations  descents of property  wills  trusts  taxation  and a host of other important interests  not omitting lands and other property     Hayes was greatly saddened by his wife s death in 1889    He wrote that  the soul had left  Spiegel Grove   when she died    After Lucy s death  Hayes s daughter Fanny became his traveling companion  and he enjoyed visits from his grandchildren    In 1890  he chaired the Lake Mohonk Conference on the Negro Question  a gathering of reformers that met in upstate New York to discuss racial issues    Hayes died of complications of a heart attack at his home on January 17  1893    His last words were  I know that I m going where Lucy is     President elect Grover Cleveland and Ohio Governor William McKinley led the funeral procession that followed Hayes s body until he was interred in Oakwood Cemetery      Following the donation of his home to the state of Ohio for the Spiegel Grove State Park   he was re interred there in 1915    The following year the Hayes Commemorative Library and Museum   the first presidential library in the United States  was opened on the site  funded by contributions from the state of Ohio and Hayes  family     An 1878 dispute

County   North Carolina     He later lived in and represented Tennessee   A Democrat   Polk served as the 17th Speaker of the House of Representatives  18351839  and Governor of Tennessee  18391841   Polk was the surprise   dark horse   candidate for president in 1844  defeating Henry Clay of the rival Whig Party by promising to annex Texas   Polk was a leader of Jacksonian Democracy during the Second Party System    Polk is often considered the last strong pre Civil War president  and he is the earliest of whom surviving photographs were taken during a term in office  Many scholars and historians have commented on his interventionist foreign policy  he threatened war with the United Kingdom over the issue of which nation owned the Oregon Country   then backed away and split the ownership of the region with the UK  When Mexico rejected American annexation of Texas  Polk also led the nation to a sweeping victory in the MexicanAmerican War   which gave the United States most of its present Southwest   He secured passage of the Walker tariff of 1846  which had low rates that pleased his native South  and he established a treasury system that lasted until 1913   Polk oversaw the opening of the U S  Naval Academy and the Smithsonian Institution   the groundbreaking for the Washington Monument   and the issuance of the first postage stamps in the United States  He promised to serve only one term and did not run for reelection  He died of cholera three months after his term ended   Scholars have ranked him favorably on lists of greatest presidents for his ability to promote  obtain support for  and achieve all of the major items on his presidential agenda  Polk has been called the  least known consequential president    of the United States     James Knox Polk  the first of ten children  was born on November 2  1795 in a farmhouse  possibly a log cabin     in what is now Pineville  North Carolina in Mecklenburg County   just outside Charlotte     His father  Samuel Polk  was a slaveholder  successful farmer and surveyor of Scots Irish descent  His mother  Jane Polk  ne Knox   was a descendant of a brother of the Scottish religious reformer John Knox   She named her firstborn after her father James Knox    Like most early Scots Irish settlers in the North Carolina mountains  the Knox and Polk families were Presbyterian   While Jane remained a devout Presbyterian her entire life  Samuel  whose father  Ezekiel Polk   was a deist   rejected dogmatic Presbyterianism  When the parents took James to church to be baptized  the father Samuel refused to declare his belief in Christianity  and the minister refused to baptize the child      In 1803  most of Polk s relatives moved to the Duck River area in what is now Maury County   Middle Tennessee  Polk s family waited until 1806 to follow    The family grew prosperous  with Samuel Polk turning to land speculation and becoming a county judge    Polk was home schooled    His health was problematic and in 1812 his pain became so unbearable that he was taken to Dr  Ephraim McDowell of Danville  Kentucky   who operated to remove urinary stones     Polk was awake during the operation with nothing but brandy available for anesthetic   but it was successful  The surgery may have left Polk sterile   as he did not sire any children     When Polk recovered  his father offered to bring him into the mercantile business  but Polk refused    In July 1813  Polk enrolled at the Zion Church near his home  A year later he attended an academy in Murfreesboro   where he may have met his future wife  Sarah Childress     At Murfreesboro  Polk proved a promising student  In January 1816  he transferred and was admitted into the University of North Carolina as a second semester sophomore  The Polks had connections with the university  then a small school of about 80 students  Sam Polk was their land agent for Tennessee  and his cousin  William Polk   was a trustee    While there  Polk joined the Dialectic Society where he regularly took part in debates and learned the art of oratory   His roommate William Dunn Moseley later became the first governor of Florida  Polk graduated with honors in May 1818    The University later named the lower quad on its main campus  Polk Place     After graduation  Polk traveled to Nashville to study law under renowned Nashville trial attorney Felix Grundy     Grundy became Polk s first mentor  On September 20  1819  Polk  with Grundy s endorsement  was elected clerk for the Tennessee State Senate     Polk was reelected as clerk in 1821 without opposition  and would continue to serve until 1822  Polk was admitted to the bar in June 1820 and his first case was to defend his father against a public fighting charge  and secure his release for a one dollar fine    Polk s practice was successful as there were many cases arising from debts after the Panic of 1819      In 1822 Polk joined the Tennessee militia as a captain in the cavalry regiment of the 5th Brigade  He was later appointed a colonel on the staff of Governor William Carroll   and was afterwards often referred to or addressed by his military title      Polk s oratory became popular  earning him the nickname  Napoleon of the Stump   In 1822 Polk resigned his position as clerk to run his successful campaign for the Tennessee state legislature in 1823  in which he defeated incumbent William Yancey  becoming the new representative of Maury County      In October 1823 Polk voted for Andrew Jackson to become the next United States Senator from Tennessee    Jackson won and from then on Polk was a firm supporter of Jackson     Polk courted Sarah Childress   and they married on January 1  1824 in Murfreesboro    Polk was then 28  and Sarah was 20 years old  They had no children  During Polk s political career  Sarah assisted her husband with his speeches  gave him advice on policy matters and played an active role in his campaigns  An old story told that Andrew Jackson had encouraged their romance when they began to court     In 1824  Jackson ran for President but was defeated    Though Jackson had won the popular vote   neither he nor any of the other candidates   John Quincy Adams   Henry Clay   and William H  Crawford   had won a majority of the electoral vote  The House of Representatives then had to select the verdict  Clay  who had received the least amount of electoral votes and dropped from the ballot  supported Adams    Clay s support proved to be the deciding factor in the House and Adams was elected President    Adams then offered Clay a position in the Cabinet as Secretary of State      In 1825  Polk ran for the United States House of Representatives for the Tennessee s 6th congressional district     Polk vigorously campaigned in the district  Polk was so active that Sarah began to worry about his health    During the campaign  Polk s opponents said that at the age of 29 Polk was too young for a spot in the House  but he won the election and took his seat in Congress    When Polk arrived in Washington  D C  he roomed in Benjamin Burch s boarding house with some other Tennessee representatives  including Sam Houston   Polk made his first major speech on March 13  1826  in which he said that the Electoral College should be abolished and that the President should be elected by the popular vote    After Congress went into recess in the summer of 1826  Polk returned to Tennessee to see Sarah  and when Congress met again in the autumn  Polk returned to Washington with Sarah  In 1827 Polk was reelected to Congress    In 1828  Jackson ran for President again and during the campaign Polk and Jackson corresponded  with Polk giving Jackson advice on his campaign  With Jackson s victory in the election Polk began to support the administration s position in Congress    During this time  Polk continued to be reelected in the House  In August 1833  after being elected to this fifth term  Polk became the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee     In June 1834  Speaker of the House Andrew Stevenson resigned  leaving the spot for speaker open    Polk ran against fellow Tennessean John Bell for Speaker  and  after ten ballots  Bell won  However  in 1835  Polk ran against Bell for Speaker again and won     Polk worked for Jackson s policies as speaker  and Van Buren s when he succeeded Jackson in 1837  he appointed committees with Democratic chairs and majorities  including the New York radical C  C  Cambreleng as Chair of the Ways and Means Committee   although he maintained the facade of traditional bipartisanship    The two major issues during Polk s speakership were slavery and the economy  after the Panic of 1837   Van Buren and Polk faced pressure to rescind the Specie Circular   an act that had been signed by Jackson to boost the economy  The act required that payment for government lands be in gold and silver  However  with support from Polk and his cabinet  Van Buren chose to stick with the Specie Circular     Polk attempted to make a more orderly house  He never challenged anyone to a duel no matter how much they insulted his honor as was customary then    Polk also issued the gag rule on petitions from abolitionists     Polk remains the only president who served as Speaker of the House   In 1838  the political situation in Tennesseewhere  in 1835  Democrats had lost the governorship for the first time in their party s historypersuaded Polk to return to help the party at home    Leaving Congress in 1839  Polk became a candidate in the Tennessee gubernatorial election  defeating the incumbent Whig   Newton Cannon by about 2 500 votes  out of about 105 000     Polk s three major programs during his governorship  regulating state banks  implementing state internal improvements  and improving education all did not get approval by the legislature    In the presidential election of 1840   Van Buren was overwhelmingly defeated by a popular Whig  William Henry Harrison   Polk received one electoral vote from Tennessee for Vice President in the election    Polk lost his own reelection to James C  Jones   in 1841  by 3 243 votes    He challenged Jones in 1843  campaigning across the state and publicly debating against Jones  but was defeated again  this time by a slightly greater margin of 3 833 votes       Polk initially hoped to be nominated for vice president at the Democratic convention   which began on May 27  1844    The leading contender for the presidential nomination was former President Martin Van Buren     who wanted to stop the expansion of slavery  Other candidates included James Buchanan   General Lewis Cass   Cave Johnson   John C  Calhoun   and Levi Woodbury   The primary point of political contention involved the Republic of Texas   which  after declaring independence from Mexico in 1836  had asked to join the United States  but was refused by Washington  Van Buren opposed the annexation but in doing so lost the support of many Democrats  including former President Andrew Jackson  who still had much influence  Van Buren won a simple majority on the convention s first ballot but did not attain the two thirds supermajority required for nomination  In subsequent rounds the vote swung toward Cass  but he also fell short of the supermajority  When it became clear after another six ballots that neither of the front runners would win the required majority  Polk emerged as a   dark horse   candidate  After an indecisive eighth ballot  the convention unanimously nominated Polk   Before the convention  Jackson told Polk that he was his favorite for the nomination of the Democratic Party  Even with this support  Polk instructed his managers at the convention to support Van Buren if he could win the nomination  This assured that if a deadlocked convention occurred  initial supporters of Van Buren would pick Polk as a compromise candidate for the Democrats  In the end  this is exactly what happened as a result of Polk s support of westward expansion     When advised of his nomination  Polk replied   It has been well observed that the office of President of the United States should neither be sought nor declined  I have never sought it  nor should I feel at liberty to decline it  if conferred upon me by the voluntary suffrages of my fellow citizens   Because the Democratic Party was splintered into bitter factions  Polk promised to serve only one term if elected  hoping that his disappointed rival Democrats would unite behind him with the knowledge that another candidate would be chosen in four years     Polk s Whig opponent in the 1844 presidential election was Henry Clay of Kentucky   Incumbent President John Tyler a former Democrat and Whighad been expelled from the Whig Party in September 1841 and was not nominated for a second term   The annexation of Texas   which was at the forefront during the Democratic Convention  again dominated the campaign  Polk was a strong proponent of immediate annexation  while Clay seemed more equivocal and vacillating   Another campaign issue  also related to westward expansion  involved the Oregon Country   then under the joint occupation of the United States and the United Kingdom  The Democrats had championed the cause of expansion  informally linking the controversial Texas annexation issue with a claim to the entire Oregon Country  thus appealing to both Northern and Southern expansionists   The slogan  Fifty four Forty or Fight   often incorrectly attributed to the 1844 election  did not appear until later  see Oregon boundary dispute    Polk s consistent support for westward expansionwhat Democrats would later call   Manifest Destiny  likely played an important role in his victory  as his opponent Clay hedged his position   In the election  Polk and his running mate  George M  Dallas   won in the South and West   while Clay drew support in the Northeast   Polk lost both his birth state  North Carolina  and his state of residence  Tennessee  the most recent successful presidential candidate to do so  However  he won New York  where Clay lost votes to the antislavery Liberty Party candidate James G  Birney   Also contributing to Polk s victory was the support of new immigrant voters  who opposed the Whigs  policies  Polk won the popular vote by a margin of about 39 000 out of 2 6million  and took the Electoral College with 170 votes to Clay s 105    Polk won 15 states  while Clay won 11     When he took office on March 4  1845  Polk  at 49  became the youngest man at the time to assume the presidency  According to a story told decades later by George Bancroft   Polk set four clearly defined goals for his administration   Pledged to serve only one term  he accomplished all these objectives in just four years  By linking acquisition of new lands in Oregon  with no slavery  and Texas  with slavery   he hoped to satisfy both North and South   During his presidency James K  Polk was known as  Young Hickory   an allusion to his mentor Andrew Jackson   and  Napoleon of the Stump   for his speaking skills   In 1846  Congress approved the Walker Tariff  named after Robert J  Walker   the Secretary of the Treasury    which represented a substantial reduction of the high Whig backed Tariff of 1842     The new law abandoned ad valorem tariffs and set rates independent of the monetary value of the product  Polk s actions were popular in the South and West  however  they were despised by many protectionists in Pennsylvania    In 1846  Polk approved a law restoring the Independent Treasury System  under which government funds were held in the Treasury and not in banks or other financial institutions  This established independent treasury deposit offices  separate from private or state banks  to receive all government funds   Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Bill in 1846 to provide  500 000 to improve rivers and harbors  but Polk vetoed the bill  It would have provided for federally funded internal improvements on small harbors  Polk believed that this was unconstitutional because the bill unfairly favored particular areas  including ports which had no foreign trade  Polk believed that these problems were local and not national  Polk feared that passing the Rivers and Harbors Bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home districts  a type of corruption that would spell doom to the virtue of the republic     In this regard he followed his hero Andrew Jackson   who had vetoed the Maysville Road Bill in 1830 on similar grounds     During his presidency  many abolitionists harshly criticized him as an instrument of the   Slave Power    and claimed that spreading slavery was the reason he supported annexing Texas and later war with Mexico     Polk stated in his diary that he believed slavery could not exist in the territories won from Mexico    but refused to endorse the Wilmot Proviso that would forbid it there  Polk argued instead for extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific Ocean  which would prohibit the expansion of slavery above 36 30  west of Missouri   but allow it below that line if approved by eligible voters in the territory  William Dusinberre has argued that Polk s diary  which he kept during his presidency  was written for later publication  and does not represent Polk s policy   Polk was a slaveholder for his entire life  His father  Samuel Polk  had left Polk more than 8 000 acres  32km  of land  and divided about 53 slaves to his widow and children after he died  James inherited twenty of his father s slaves  either directly or from deceased brothers  In 1831  he became an absentee cotton planter  sending slaves to clear plantation land that his father had left him near Somerville  Tennessee   Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and  together with his brother in law  bought 920 acres  3 7km  of land  a cotton plantation near Coffeeville  Mississippi   He ran this plantation for the rest of his life  eventually taking it over completely from his brother in law  Polk rarely sold slaves  although once he became President and could better afford it  he bought more  Polk s will stipulated that their slaves were to be freed after his wife Sarah had died  However  the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution freed all remaining slaves in rebel states long before the death of his wife in 1891     Polk strongly supported expansion  Democrats believed that opening up more land for yeoman farmers was critical for the success of republican virtue   See Manifest Destiny    Like most Southerners  he supported the annexation of Texas  To balance the interests of North and South  he wanted to acquire the Oregon Country  present day Oregon   Washington   Idaho   and British Columbia   as well  He sought to purchase California  which Mexico had neglected   Polk put heavy pressure on Britain to resolve the Oregon boundary dispute   Since 1818  the territory had been under the joint occupation and control of the United Kingdom and the United States  Previous U S  administrations had offered to divide the region along the 49th parallel   which was not acceptable to Britain  as they had commercial interests along the Columbia River   Although the Democratic platform asserted a claim to the entire region  Polk was willing to compromise  When the British again refused to accept the 49th parallel boundary proposal  Polk broke off negotiations and returned to the Democratic platform s  All Oregon  demand  which called for all of Oregon up to the 54 40 line that marked the southern boundary of Russian Alaska    54 40 or fight   now became a popular rallying cry among Democrats     Polk wanted territory  not war  so he compromised with the British Foreign Secretary  Lord Aberdeen   The Oregon Treaty of 1846 divided the Oregon Country along the 49th parallel  the original American proposal  Although there were many who still clamored for the entire territory  the treaty was approved by the Senate  By settling for the 49th parallel  Polk angered many midwestern Democrats  Many of these Democrats believed that Polk had always wanted the boundary at the 49th  and that he had fooled them into believing he wanted it at the 54th parallel   The portion of the Oregon Territory acquired by the United States later formed the states of Washington   Oregon   and Idaho   and parts of the states of Montana and Wyoming    Upon hearing of Polk s election to office  Tyler urged Congress to pass a joint resolution admitting Texas to the Union   Congress complied on February 28  1845  Texas promptly accepted the offer and officially became a state on December 29  1845  The annexation angered Mexico   which had lost Texas in 1836   Mexican politicians had repeatedly warned that annexation would lead to war  Nonetheless  just days after the resolution passed Congress  Polk declared in his inaugural address that only Texas and the United States would decide whether to annex   After the Texas annexation  Polk turned his attention to California  hoping to acquire the territory from Mexico before any European nation did so  The main interest was San Francisco Bay as an access point for trade with Asia  In 1845  he sent diplomat John Slidell to Mexico to purchase California and New Mexico for  2430million  Slidell s arrival caused political turmoil in Mexico after word leaked out that he was there to purchase additional territory and not to offer compensation for the loss of Texas  The Mexicans refused to receive Slidell  citing a technical problem with his credentials  In January 1846  to increase pressure on Mexico to negotiate  Polk sent troops under General Zachary Taylor into the area between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande territory that was claimed by both the U S  and Mexico   Slidell returned to Washington in May 1846  having been rebuffed by the Mexican government  Polk regarded this treatment of his diplomat as an insult and an  ample cause of war     and he prepared to ask Congress for a declaration of war  Meanwhile  Taylor crossed the Rio Grande and briefly occupied Matamoros  Tamaulipas   Taylor continued to blockade ships from entering the port of Matamoros  Mere days before Polk intended to make his request to Congress  he received word that Mexican forces had crossed the Rio Grande area and killed eleven American soldiers  Polk then made this the casus belli   and in a message to Congress on May 11  1846  he stated that Mexico had  invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil    Some Whigs  such as Abraham Lincoln   challenged Polk s version of events    but Congress overwhelmingly approved the declaration of war  Many Whigs feared that opposition would cost them politically by casting themselves as unpatriotic for not supporting the war effort     In the House  antislavery Whigs led by John Quincy Adams voted against the war  among Democrats  Senator John C  Calhoun was the most notable opponent of the declaration   Polk selected the top generals and set the military strategy of the war  By the summer of 1846  American forces under General Stephen W  Kearny had captured New Mexico  Meanwhile  Army captain John C  Frmont led settlers in northern California to overthrow the Mexican garrison in Sonoma  in the Bear Flag Revolt    General Zachary Taylor  at the same time  was having success on the Rio Grande  although Polk did not reinforce his troops there  The United States also negotiated a secret arrangement with Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna   the Mexican general and dictator who had been overthrown in 1844  Santa Anna agreed that  if given safe passage into Mexico  he would attempt to persuade those in power to sell California and New Mexico to the United States  Once he reached Mexico  however  he reneged on his agreement  declared himself President  and tried to drive the American invaders back  Santa Anna s efforts  however  were in vain  as Generals Taylor and Winfield Scott destroyed all resistance  Scott captured Mexico City in September 1847  and Taylor won a series of victories in northern Mexico  Even after these battles  Mexico did not surrender until 1848  when it agreed to peace terms set out by Polk   Polk sent diplomat Nicholas Trist to negotiate with the Mexicans  Lack of progress prompted the President to order Trist to return to the United States  but the diplomat ignored the instructions and stayed in Mexico to continue bargaining  Trist successfully negotiated the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848  which Polk agreed to ratify  ignoring calls from Democrats who demanded that all Mexico be annexed  The treaty added 1 2million square miles  3 1million square kilometers  of territory to the United States  Mexico s size was halved  while that of the United States increased by a third  California   Nevada   Utah   most of Arizona   and parts of New Mexico   Colorado and Wyoming were all included in the Mexican Cession  The treaty also recognized the annexation of Texas and acknowledged American control over the disputed territory between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande  Mexico  in turn  received  15million  The war claimed fewer than 20 000 American lives but over 50 000 Mexican ones    It may have cost the United States  100million    Finally  the Wilmot Proviso injected the issue of slavery in the new territories  even though Polk had insisted to Congress and in his diary that this had never been a war goal   The treaty  however  needed ratification by the Senate  In March 1848  the Whigs  who had been so opposed to Polk s policy  suddenly changed position  Two thirds of the Whigs voted for Polk s treaty  This ended the war and legalized the acquisition of the territories   The war had serious consequences for Polk and the Democrats  It gave the Whig Party a unifying message of denouncing the war as an immoral act of aggression carried out through abuse of power by the president  In the 1848 election  however  the Whigs nominated General Zachary Taylor   a war hero  and celebrated his victories  Taylor refused to criticize Polk  As a result of the strain of managing the war effort directly and in close detail  Polk s health markedly declined toward the end of his presidency   In mid 1848  President Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain  Romulus Mitchell Saunders   to negotiate the purchase of Cuba and offer Spain up to  100million  an astounding sum at the time for one territory  equal to  2 73billion in present day terms    Cuba was close to the United States and had slavery  so the idea appealed to Southerners but was unwelcome in the North  However  Spain was still making huge profits in Cuba  notably in sugar  molasses  rum  and tobacco   and thus the Spanish government rejected Saunders  overtures     One of Polk s last acts as President was to sign the bill creating the Department of the Interior  March 3  1849   This was the first new cabinet position created since the early days of the Republic  Polk had misgivings about the federal government usurping power over public lands from the states  however  the delivery of the legislation on his last full day in office gave him no time to find constitutional grounds for a veto  or to draft a sufficient veto message  so Polk signed the bill     Polk appointed the following Justices to the U S  Supreme Court    Woodbury was from New Hampshire  and Grier from Pennsylvania  Polk also nominated George W  Woodward of Pennsylvania in 1846  but the United States Senate rejected the nomination   Polk appointed eight other federal judges  one to the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia   and seven to various United States district courts    29th Congress  March 4  1845 March 4  1847   30th Congress  March 4  1847 March 4  1849   Polk s time in the White House took its toll on his health  Full of enthusiasm and vigor when he entered office  Polk left on March 4  1849  exhausted by his years of public service  He lost weight and had deep lines on his face and dark circles under his eyes  He is believed to have contracted cholera in New Orleans   Louisiana   on a goodwill tour of the South after leaving the White House    He died of cholera at his new home    Polk Place  in Nashville  Tennessee   at 3 15pm on June 15  1849  three months after leaving office  He was buried on the grounds of Polk Place  Polk s last words illustrate his devotion to his wife   I love you  Sarah  For all eternity  I love you     She lived at Polk Place for over forty years after his death  She died on August 14  1891  Polk was also survived by his mother  Jane Knox Polk  who died on January 11  1852       Polk had the shortest retirement of all Presidents at 103 days  He was the youngest former president to die in retirement at the age of 53  Along with George Washington   Andrew Johnson   Chester A  Arthur   Calvin Coolidge and Lyndon B  Johnson   he is one of six presidents to have died while his direct successor was in office  He and his wife are buried in a tomb on the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville  Tennessee  The tomb was moved to this location from their downtown Nashville mansion  Polk Place   in 1893   Polk s historic reputation was largely formed by the attacks made on him in his own time  the Whigs claimed that he was drawn from a well deserved obscurity  Senator Tom Corwin of Ohio remarked  James K  Polk  of Tennessee  After that   who is safe   The Republican historians of the nineteenth century inherited this view  Polk was a compromise between the Democrats of the North  like David Wilmot and Silas Wright   and the plantation owners who were led by John C  Calhoun   the northern Democrats thought that when they did not get their way  it was because he was the tool of the slaveholders  and the conservatives of the South insisted that he was the tool of the northern Democrats  These views were long reflected in the historical literature  until Arthur M  Schlesinger  Jr and Bernard De Voto argued that Polk was nobody s tool  but set his own goals and achieved them     Polk is now recognized  not only as the strongest president between Jackson and Lincoln  but the president who made the United States a coast to coast nation  When historians began ranking the presidents in 1948  Polk ranked 10th in Arthur M  Schlesinger s poll  and has subsequently ranked 8th in Schlesingers 1962 poll  11th in the Riders McIver Poll  1996   11th in the most recent Siena Poll  2002   9th in the most recent Wall Street Journal Poll  2005   and 12th in the latest C Span Poll  2009      Polk biographers over the years have sized up the magnitude of Polks achievements and his legacy  particularly his two most recent  There are three key reasons why James K  Polk deserves recognition as a significant and influential American president  Walter Borneman wrote  First  Polk accomplished the objectives of his presidential term as he defined them  second  he was the most decisive chief executive before the Civil War   and third  he greatly expanded the executive power of the presidency  particularly its war powers  its role as commander in chief  and its oversight of the executive branch     President Harry S  Truman summarized this view by saying that Polk was  a great president  Said what he intended to do and did it      While Polks legacy thus takes many forms  the most outstanding is the map of the continental United States  whose landmass he increased by a third  To look at that map  Robert Merry concluded  and to take in the western and southwestern expanse included in it  is to see the magnitude of Polks presidential accomplishments     Nevertheless  Polk s aggressive expansionism has been criticized on ethical grounds  He believed in   Manifest Destiny   even more than most did  Referencing the Mexican American War  General Ulysses S  Grant stated that  I was bitterly opposed to the  Texas annexation   and to this day regard the war  which resulted  as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation  It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies  in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory     Whig politicians  including Abraham Lincoln and John Quincy Adams   contended that the Texas Annexation and the Mexican Cession enhanced the pro slavery factions of the United States    Unsatisfactory conditions pertaining to the status of slavery in the territories acquired during the Polk administration led to the Compromise of 1850   one of the primary factors in the establishment of the Republican Party and later the beginning of the American Civil War      Humorously  Sam Houston is said to have observed that Polk was  a victim of the use of water as a beverage     ", "Jackson": "Early life and education Revolutionary War service Legal and political career Land

15  1767 June 8  1845  was the seventh President of the United States  18291837   He was born near the end of the colonial era   somewhere near the then unmarked border between North and South Carolina   into a recently immigrated Scots Irish farming family of relatively modest means  During the American Revolutionary War Jackson  whose family supported the revolutionary cause  acted as a courier  He was captured  at age 13  and mistreated by his British captors  He later became a lawyer  He was elected to the U S  House of Representatives   and then to the U S  Senate   In 1801  Jackson was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia  which became his political as well as military base  Jackson owned hundreds of slaves who worked on the Hermitage plantation which he acquired in 1804  Jackson killed a man in a duel in 1806  over a matter of honor regarding his wife Rachel   Jackson gained national fame through his role in the War of 1812   most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at the Battle of New Orleans   Jackson s army was then sent to Florida where he deposed the small Spanish garrison  This led directly to the treaty which formally transferred Florida from Spain to the United States   Nominated for president in 1824   Jackson narrowly lost to John Quincy Adams   Jackson s supporters then founded what became the Democratic Party   Nominated again in 1828   Jackson crusaded against Adams and the  corrupt bargain  between Adams and Henry Clay he said cost him the 1824 election  Building on his base in the West and new support from Virginia and New York  he won by a landslide  The Adams campaigners called him and his wife Rachel Jackson  bigamists   she died just after the election and he called the slanderers  murderers   swearing never to forgive them  His struggles with Congress were personified in his personal rivalry with Henry Clay   whom Jackson deeply disliked  and who led the opposition  the emerging Whig Party    As president  he faced a threat of secession from South Carolina over the   Tariff of Abominations   which Congress had enacted under Adams  In contrast to several of his immediate successors  he denied the right of a state to secede from the union  or to nullify federal law  The Nullification Crisis was defused when the tariff was amended and Jackson threatened the use of military force if South Carolina  or any other state  attempted to secede   Congress attempted to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States several years before the expiration of its charter  which he opposed  He vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832  and dismantled it by the time its charter expired in 1836  Jackson s presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the   spoils system   in American politics  Also  he supported  signed  and enforced the Indian Removal Act   which relocated a number of native tribes to Indian Territory  now Oklahoma    He faced and defeated Henry Clay in the 1832 Presidential Election   and opposed Clay generally  Jackson supported his vice president Martin Van Buren   who was elected president in 1836  He worked to bolster the Democratic Party and helped his friend James K  Polk win the 1844 presidential election     Jackson was born on March 15  1767  His parents were Scots Irish colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson  Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ireland two years earlier      Jackson s father was born in Carrickfergus   County Antrim   in current day Northern Ireland   around 1738    Jackson s parents lived in the village of Boneybefore   also in County Antrim   When they emigrated to America in 1765  Jackson s parents probably landed in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots Irish community in the Waxhaws region  straddling the border between North and South Carolina     They brought two children from Ireland  Hugh  born 1763  and Robert  born 1764    Jackson s father died in an accident in February 1767  at the age of 29  three weeks before his son Andrew was born in the Waxhaws area  His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying Jackson s father  The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed     In 1824  Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle s plantation in Lancaster County  South Carolina   But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824   which Jackson opposed  In the mid 1850s  second hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle s home in North Carolina     Jackson received a sporadic education in the local  old field  school    In 1781  he worked for a time in a saddle maker s shop    Later  he taught school and studied law in Salisbury  North Carolina   In 1787  he was admitted to the bar  and moved to Jonesborough   in what was then the Western District of North Carolina  This area later became the Southwest Territory  1790   the precursor to the state of Tennessee   During the Revolutionary War   Jackson  at age thirteen  informally helped the local militia as a courier    His eldest brother  Hugh  died from heat exhaustion during the Battle of Stono Ferry   on June 20  1779  Jackson and his brother Robert were captured by the British and held as prisoners  they nearly starved to death in captivity  When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer  the officer slashed at the youth with a sword  leaving Jackson with scars on his left hand and head  as well as an intense hatred for the British    While imprisoned  the brothers contracted smallpox    Robert Jackson died on April 27  1781  a few days after their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers  release  After being assured Andrew would recover  Elizabeth Jackson volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in Charleston harbor  where there had been an outbreak of cholera   She died from the disease in November 1781  and was buried in an unmarked grave  Jackson became an orphan at age 14    Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war  Jackson blamed the British for his losses   Jackson began his legal career in Jonesborough  now northeastern Tennessee  Though his legal education was scanty  he knew enough to be a country lawyer on the frontier   Since he was not from a distinguished family  he had to make his career by his own merits  soon he began to prosper in the rough and tumble world of frontier law  Most of the actions grew out of disputed land claims  or from assault and battery   In 1788  he was appointed Solicitor  prosecutor  of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the Territory South of the River Ohio after 1791   Jackson was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796  When Tennessee achieved statehood that year  Jackson was elected its U S  Representative   The following year  he was elected U S  Senator as a Democratic Republican   but he resigned within a year   His return to the U S  Senate in 1823  after 24 years  11 months  3 days out of office  marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history     In 1798  he was appointed a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court   serving until 1804     In 1794  Jackson formed a business with John Overton  for the purpose of purchasing lands as well those lands without as within military bounds overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw    Upon his return from Florida   Jackson negotiated the sale of the land from the Chickasaw Nation in 1818  termed the Jackson Purchase    He was one of the three original investors who founded Memphis  Tennessee in 1819  see History of Memphis  Tennessee       In addition to his legal and political career  Jackson prospered as planter   slave owner  and merchant  He built a home and the first general store in Gallatin  Tennessee in 1803  The next year he acquired the Hermitage   a 640 acre  259ha  plantation in Davidson County   near Nashville   Jackson later added 360 acres  146ha  to the plantation  which eventually grew to 1 050 acres  425ha   The primary crop was cotton   grown by enslaved workers  Starting with nine slaves  Jackson held as many as 44 by 1820  and later held up to 150 slaves  making him among the planter elite  Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves       African American men  women  and children were enslaved by Jackson on three sections of the Hermitage plantation    Slaves lived in extended family units between five and ten persons quartered in 20 foot square cabins made either of brick or logs  The size and quality of Jackson s Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times  To help slaves acquire food staples  in addition to Jackson s rations  Jackson supplied slaves with guns  knives  and fishing equipment for hunting and fishing    At times Jackson paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets  The Hermitage plantation was a profit making enterprise and Jackson  who demanded slave loyalty  permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves  offenses were severe enough  Jackson at various times posted advertisements for his fugitive slaves  For the standards of his times Jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food  housing  and did not prohibit his female slaves from childbirthing     Jackson was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801  with the rank of colonel   He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802     During the War of 1812   the Shawnee chief Tecumseh encouraged the   Red Stick   Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements  He had unified tribes in the Northwest to rise up against the Americans  trying to repel American settlers from those lands north of the Ohio   Four hundred settlers were killed in the Fort Mims massacre one of the few instances of Native Americans killing a large number of American settlers and their African American slaves   which brought the United States into the internal Creek campaign   Occurring at the same time as the War of 1812   the Creek campaign saw Jackson command the U S  forces  which included the Tennessee militia  U S  regulars   and Cherokee   Choctaw   and Lower Creek warriors  Sam Houston and David Crockett served under Jackson in this campaign   Jackson defeated the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814  US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle  but spared the chief Red Eagle   a mixed race man also known as William Weatherford   After the victory  Madison s Secretary of War Armstrong ordered Major General Thomas Pinckney in April 1814 to make the surrender treaty    Pinckney made moderate terms of surrender including handing over an unspecified amount of land  the construction of U S  forts  turning over warriors who instigated hostilities  and agreeing to stop trade with foreign countries  Jackson opposed the unpopular Pinckney treaty  desiring to completely destroy the Creek nation  Jackson was promoted Major General and given charge of the Seventh Military District  replacing Major General Thomas Flournoy  Jackson  now commanding general  immediately threw out Pinckney s treaty and forced severe terms upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies  wresting twenty two million acres in present day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European American settlement    Jackson also confiscated land from Indians who had sided with the Americans  Jackson stated that the terms must be accepted or the tribe would be forcefully removed to Florida  On August 9  1814  35 Indian elder leaders signed Jackson s Treaty of Fort Jackson   The warrior faction of the Creek nation and the British  however  did not formally recognize the treaty     According to author Gloria Jahoda   the Creeks coined their own name for him  Jacksa Chula Harjo or  Jackson  old and fierce      Jackson s service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success  When British forces threatened New Orleans   Jackson took command of the defenses  including militia from several western states and territories  He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops  They said he was  tough as old hickory  wood on the battlefield  and he acquired the nickname of  Old Hickory   In the Battle of New Orleans on January 8  1815  Jackson s 5 000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7 500 British  At the end of the battle  the British had 2 037 casualties  291 dead  including three senior generals   1 262 wounded  and 484 captured or missing  The Americans had 71 casualties  13 dead  39 wounded  and 19 missing     Jackson ordered the arrest of U  S  District Court Judge Dominic A  Hall in March 1815  after the judge signed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a Louisiana legislator that Jackson had arrested    Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper  challenging Jackson s refusal to release the militia  after the British ceded the field of battle    Jackson had claimed the authority to declare martial law over the entire City of New Orleans  not merely his  camp     After ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator  a federal judge  a lawyer and after intervention of Joshua Lewis   a State Judge  who was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia  and who also signed a writ of habeas corpus against Jackson  his commanding officer  seeking Judge Hall s release  Jackson relented     Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear Jackson  But they fared better than did the six members of the militia whose executions  ordered by Jackson  would surface as the Coffin Handbills during his 1828 Presidential campaign  Nonetheless  Jackson became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the War of 1812    By a resolution on February 27  1815  Jackson received the Thanks of Congress as well as a Congressional Gold Medal     Alexis de Tocqueville    underwhelmed  by Jackson  later commented in Democracy in America that Jackson     was raised to the Presidency  and has been maintained there  solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained  twenty years ago  under the walls of New Orleans      Jackson served in the military again during the First Seminole War   He was ordered by President James Monroe in December 1817 to lead a campaign in Georgia against the Seminole and Creek Indians  Jackson was also charged with preventing Spanish Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves  Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions  His directions were to  terminate the conflict     Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida  Before going  Jackson wrote to Monroe   Let it be signified to me through any channel    that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States  and in sixty days it will be accomplished     Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous  sufficient for international denials   The Seminole attacked Jackson s Tennessee volunteers  The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable  and Jackson burned their houses and the crops  He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians  Jackson believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the British encouraged Indians to fight  and argued that his actions were undertaken in self defense  Jackson captured Pensacola  Florida   with little more than some warning shots  and deposed the Spanish governor  He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects  Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot   who had been supplying and advising the Indians  Jackson s actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle  he became known as  Sharp Knife     The executions  and Jackson s invasion of territory belonging to Spain  a country with which the U S  was not at war  created an international incident  Many in the Monroe administration called for Jackson to be censured   The Secretary of State   John Quincy Adams   an early believer in Manifest Destiny   defended Jackson  When the Spanish minister demanded a  suitable punishment  for Jackson  Adams wrote back   Spain must immediately  decide  either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory    or cede to the United States a province  of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession  but which is  in fact    a post of annoyance to them     Adams used Jackson s conquest  and Spain s own weakness  to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the AdamsOns Treaty   Jackson was subsequently named Florida s military governor and served from March 10  1821  to December 31  1821   The Tennessee legislature nominated Jackson for President in 1822  It also elected him U S  Senator again  By 1824  the Democratic Republican Party had become the only functioning national party  Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal Congressional nominating caucus   but this had become unpopular  In 1824  most of the Democratic Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus  Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary William H  Crawford for President and Albert Gallatin for Vice President  A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for President a month later  stating that the irregular caucus ignored the  voice of the people  and was a  vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he  Crawford  was the regular democratic candidate     Gallatin criticized Jackson as  an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory  but from incapacity  military habits  and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions  altogether unfit for the office      Besides Jackson and Crawford  the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and House Speaker Henry Clay were also candidates  Jackson received the most popular votes  but not a majority  and four states had no popular ballot   The electoral votes were split four ways  with Jackson having a plurality  Because no candidate received a majority  the election was decided by the House of Representatives   which chose Adams  Jackson supporters denounced this result as a   corrupt bargain   because Clay gave his state s support to Adams  who subsequently appointed Clay as Secretary of State   As none of Kentucky s electors had initially voted for Adams  and Jackson had won the popular vote  some Kentucky politicians criticized Clay for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors  Jackson s defeat burnished his political credentials  however  many voters believed the  man of the people  had been robbed by the  corrupt aristocrats of the East    Jackson denounced the  corrupt bargain  that put Adams in the White House and laid plans for a crusade to oust Adams from office    After resigning the Senate in October 1825  he continued his quest for the Presidency  The Tennessee legislature again nominated Jackson for President  He attracted Vice President John C  Calhoun   Martin Van Buren   and Thomas Ritchie into his camp  Van Buren and Ritchie were previous supporters of Crawford   Van Buren  with help from his friends in Philadelphia and Richmond   revived the old Republican Party  gave it a new name as the Democratic Party   restored party rivalries   and forged a national organization of durability    The Jackson coalition handily defeated Adams in 1828   During the election  Jackson s opponents referred to him as a   jackass    Jackson liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while  but it died out  However  it later became the symbol for the Democratic Party when cartoonist Thomas Nast popularized it     The campaign was very much a personal one  As was the custom at the time  neither candidate personally campaigned  but their political followers organized many campaign events  Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press  which reached a low point when the press accused Jackson s wife Rachel of bigamy  Though the accusation was true  as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign  it was based on events that occurred many years prior  1791 to 1794   Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him  but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife  Rachel died suddenly on December 22  1828  before his inauguration  and was buried on Christmas Eve  He blamed the Adams campaigners for her death   May God Almighty forgive her murderers   he swore at her funeral   I never can     Jackson also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards or morality   He was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation work      Jackson s name has been associated with Jacksonian democracy or the spread of democracy in terms of the passing of political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties   The Age of Jackson  shaped the national agenda and American politics    Jackson s philosophy as President followed much in the same line as Thomas Jefferson   advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation    Jackson s presidency held a high moralistic tone  having as a planter himself agrarian sympathies  a limited view of states rights and the federal government    Jackson feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values   When South Carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession   Jackson believed that the president s authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics    Instead of choosing party favorites  Jackson chose  plain  businessmen  whom he intended to control    Jackson chose Martin Van Buren as Secretary of State  John Eaton Secretary of War  Samuel Ingham Secretary of Treasury  John Branch Secretary of Navy  John Berrien as Attorney General  and William T  Barry as postmaster general    Jackson s first choice of Cabinet proved to be unsuccessful  full of bitter partisanship and gossip  especially between Eaton  Vice President John C  Calhoun   and Van Buren    By the Spring of 1831  only Barry remained  while the rest of Jackson s cabinet had been discharged    Jackson s following cabinet selections worked better together     On March 4  1829  Andrew Jackson became the first United States president elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U S  Capitol    Jackson was the first President to invite the public to attend the White House ball honoring his first inauguration  Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes  The crowd became so large that Jackson s guards could not keep them out of the White House  which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken  Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President  The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside  Jackson s raucous populism earned him the nickname  King Mob    Jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his first years in office responding to what came to be known as the Eaton affair     Vicious Washington gossip circulated among Jackson s Cabinet members and their wives including Vice President John C  Calhoun  s wife Floride concerning Secretary of War John H  Eaton and his wife Peggy   Bitter rumors spread that Peggy was loose in her morals while working at her father s tavern when her naval officer husband was away at sea  After Peggy s husband died at sea  both Eaton and Peggy were criticized for their perceived early marriage  Initially Jackson thought that Henry Clay was behind the gossip  but then he eventually concluded Calhoun was responsible for spreading the rumors  Both Jackson and Van Buren defended Eaton and his wife Peggy  however Calhoun s wife Floride and the wives of Jackson s pro Calhoun Cabinet members publicly shunned both Eaton and Peggy       Van Buren  Eaton  and Calhoun resigned office over the affair while Jackson dismissed the rest of his pro Calhoun cabinet members except Postmaster William T  Barry   Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to England  however  Calhoun s supporters in the Senate blocked the nomination giving Calhoun  who had continued to be Vice President and President of the Senate until December 1832  the deciding vote against Van Buren and blocked the nomination  Calhoun publically castigated and boasted that Van Buren s political career was over  stating the defeated nomination would     kill him  sir  kill dead  He will never kick  sir  never kick     This rumor however proved to be false as Van Buren  who played a leading role in the Jackson s unofficial Kitchen Cabinet   allied with Jackson and became Jackson s successor and Vice Presidential candidate in 1832  Jackson also acquired the Globe paper that was sympathetic with him       Throughout his eight years in office  Jackson made about 70 treaties with native American tribes both in the South and the Northwest     Jackson s presidency marked a new era in Indian  Anglo American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal    Jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes  though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates  The southern tribes included the Choctaw   Creek   Chickasaw   Seminole and the Cherokee   The northwest tribes include the Chippewa   Ottawa   and the Potawatomi   Though conflict between Indians and American settlers took place in the north and in the south  the problem was worse in the south where the Indian populations were larger  Indian wars broke out repeatedly  often when native tribes  especially the Muscogee and Seminole Indians  refused to abide by the treaties for various reasons    The Second Seminole War   started in December 1835  lasted over six years finally ending in August 1842 under President John Tyler      Though relations between Europeans  and later Americans  and Indians were always complicated  they grew increasingly complicated once American settlements began pushing further west in the years after the American Revolution   Often these relations were peaceful  though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent  both on the part of American settlers and the Indians  From George Washington to John Quincy Adams  the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly  though by Jackson s time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable  The problem was especially acute in the south  in particular the lands near the state of Georgia    where Indian populations were larger  denser  and more Americanized than those of the north  As such  there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem  and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain Indian populations  Jackson  never one known for timidity  became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency    This contrasted from his immediate predecessor  President John Q  Adams   who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors  that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention    Jackson s presidency thus took place in a new era in Indian  Anglo American relations  in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation    As such  during Jackson s presidency  Indian relations between the Southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture     In his December 8  1829  First Annual Message to Congress  Jackson advocated land west of the Mississippi River be set aside for Indian tribes  Congress had been developing its own Indian relocation bill  and Jackson had many supporters in both the Senate and House who agreed with his goal  On May 26  1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act   and Jackson signed it into law  The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west  outside of existing U S  state borders    The passage of the bill was Jackson s first successful legislative triumph and marked the Democratic party s emergence into American political society    The passage of the act was especially popular in the South where population growth and the discovery of gold on Cherokee land had increased pressure on tribal lands   The state of Georgia became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees  culminating in the 1832 U S  Supreme Court decision   Worcester v  Georgia    In that decision  U S  Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall   in writing for the court  ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands      Jackson is frequently  though incorrectly  attributed with the following response   John Marshall has made his decision  now let him enforce it   The quote originated in 1863 from Horace Greeley   Jackson used the Georgia crisis to broker an agreement whereby the Cherokee leaders agreed to a removal treaty  A group of Cherokees led by John Ridge negotiated the Treaty of New Echota with Jackson s representatives  Ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the Cherokee Nation   and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate    A group of Cherokees petitioned in protest of the proposed removal  though this wasn t taken up by the Supreme Court or the U S  Congress  in part due to delays and timing     The treaty was enforced by Jackson s successor  Van Buren  who sent 7 000 troops to carry out the relocation policy  Due to the infighting between political factions  many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began    It was subsequent to this that as many as 4 000 Cherokees died on the   Trail of Tears    By the 1830s  under constant pressure from settlers  each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands  but sizable self government groups lived in Georgia  Alabama  Mississippi  and Florida  All of these  except the Seminoles  had moved far in the coexistence with whites  and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves  Their methods earned them the title of the   Five Civilized Tribes      More than 45 000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson s administration  though a few Cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high Smoky Mountains along the North Carolina and Tennessee border     Jackson s initiatives to deal with the conflicts between Indians and American settlers has been a source of controversy     on and off over the years    especially among his political opponents at the time and ideological opponents since      Modern historians    such as Arthur Schlesinger  Jr    often note the history of American conflicts with Indians     dating to long before the American revolution  and the ultimate need for a solution which Jackson and congress partly achieved  Starting around 1970  the controversy picked up again  this time with more ideological tones  Around that time  Jackson came under sharp attack from revisionist writers on the left  such as Michael Paul Rogin and Howard Zinn   often on on this issue      In 1969 Francis Paul Prucha argued that Jackson s removal of the  Five Civilized Tribes  from the very hostile white environment in the Old South to Oklahoma probably saved their very existence       In an effort to purge the government from corruption of previous administrations  Jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments    During Jackson s tenure in office  large amounts of public money were put in the hands of public officials  Jackson  who believed appointees should be hired by merit  withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies    Jackson asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws  reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions  revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties  and laws to improve government accounting  Jackson s Postmaster Barry resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services  collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts  failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances  Jackson replaced Barry with Amos Kendall   who went on to implement much needed reforms in the Postal Service     Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President      In his third annual message to Congress  he expressed the view  I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term  So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not  in accordance with my sense of duty  omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress      Jackson s time in the presidency as saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents  The Service Pension Act of 1832  for instance  provided pensions to veterans  even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need     while an Act of July 1836 enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband s pensions     Upon assuming the presidency in 1829 Jackson enforced the Tenure of Office Act   passed earlier into law by President James Monroe in 1820  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates    Jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing father to son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will    Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was  a leading principle in the republican creed     Jackson noted   In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another     Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy  Opposed to this view however  were Jackson s supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members  In practice  this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists    The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents  Jackson only rotated about 20  of federal office holders during his first term  some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes    Jackson  however  did use his image and presidential power to award his loyal Democratic Party followers by granting them federal office appointments  Jackson s democratic approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office  Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership Jackson stated  If he lost his leg fighting for his country  that is     enough for me      Jackson s theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system   a practice that Jackson  ironically  didn t justify    The political realities of Washington  however  ultimately forced Jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations    Historians believe Jackson s presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics    Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington  such as the New York Customs House  the Postal Service  the Departments of Navy and War  and the Bureau of Indian Affairs  whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades  proved to be difficult    Other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices  forced political party campaign participation  and collection of assessments  did not take place until after Jackson s presidency    During Jackson s presidency  those in opposition to Jackson s purging of office holders  formed the Whig Party   calling Jackson  King Andrew I  having feared his military background  and named their party after the English parliamentary Whigs who opposed eighteenth century British monarchy     Another notable crisis during Jackson s period of office was the   Nullification Crisis    or  secession crisis   of 18281832  which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs  Critics alleged that high tariffs  the   Tariff of Abominations    on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U S   raising the prices paid by planters in the South  Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers   The issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun  in the South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828  supported the claim of his home state  South Carolina   that it had the right to  nullify declare voidthe tariff legislation of 1828  and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests  Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate  he also vigorously supported a strong union  with effective powers for the central government  Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue  which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men   Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13  1830  Jefferson Day dinner  involving after dinner toasts  Robert Hayne began by toasting to  The Union of the States  and the Sovereignty of the States   Jackson then rose  and in a booming voice added  Our federal Union  It must be preserved   a clear challenge to Calhoun  Calhoun clarified his position by responding  The Union  Next to our Liberty  the most dear      At the first Democratic National Convention   which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet  Calhoun and Jackson broke from each other politically and Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson s running mate in the 1832 presidential election     In December 1832  Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U S  Senator for South Carolina   In response to South Carolina s nullification claim  Jackson vowed to send troops to South Carolina to enforce the laws  In December 1832  he issued a resounding proclamation against the  nullifiers   stating that he considered  the power to annul a law of the United States  assumed by one State  incompatible with the existence of the Union  contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution   unauthorized by its spirit  inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded  and destructive of the great object for which it was formed   South Carolina  the President declared  stood on  the brink of insurrection and treason   and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought  Jackson also denied the right of secession   The Constitution    forms a government not a league    To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation      Jackson asked Congress to pass a   Force Bill   explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff  but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by Clay agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff   The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1  1833  and Jackson signed both  The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance  The Force Bill became moot because it was no longer needed  On May 1  1833  Jackson wrote   the tariff was only the pretext  and disunion and southern confederacy the real object  The next pretext will be the negro  or slavery question      When Jackson took office in 1829 spoliation claims  or compensation demands for the capture of American ships and sailors  dating from the Napoleonic era  caused strained relations between the U S  and French governments    The French Navy had captured and sent American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules  According to Secretary of State Martin Van Buren relations between the U S  and France were  hopeless     Jackson s Minister to France William C  Rives   however  through diplomacy was able to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on July 4  1831 that would award the U S    25 000 000   5 000 000  in damages    The French government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties  The French king Louis Philippe I and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies    By 1834 the non payment of reparations by the French government drew Jackson s ire and he became impatient  In his December 1834 State of the Union address  Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non payment  stating the federal government was  wholly disappointed  by the French  and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France    Feeling insulted by Jackson s words  the French people demanded an apology  In his December 1835 State of the Union Address  Jackson refused to apologize  stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful  Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment  The French government accepted Jackson s statements as sincere and in February 1836  American reparations were finally paid     In addition to France  the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with Denmark   Portugal   and Spain     Jackson s state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with Russia   Spain   Turkey   Great Britain   and Siam   Under the treaty of Great Britain  American trade was reopened in the West Indies    The trade agreement with Siam was America s first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country  As a result  American exports increased 75  while imports increased 250      Jackson  however  was unsuccessful in opening trade with China and Japan     Jackson was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain s presence and power in South America  Jackson s attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for  5 000 000 failed    Jackson s agent in Texas  Colonel Anthony Butler  suggested to take Texas over militarily  but Jackson refused  Butler was later replaced toward the end of Jackson s presidency     In 1816 the Second Bank of the United States was charted by President James Madison to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812     In 1823 President James Monroe appointed Nicholas Biddle   the Bank s third and last executive  to run the bank  In January 1832 Biddle  on advice from his friends  submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank s charter four years before the original 20 year charter was to end    Biddle s recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3  1832    Jackson  believing that Bank was fundamentally a corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners  vetoed the bill    Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values  believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy    Jackson stated the Bank made  the rich richer and the potent more powerful     The National Republican Party immediately made Jackson s veto of the Bank a political issue  attempting to undermine Jackson s popularity    Jackson s political opponents castigated Jackson s veto as  the very slang of the leveller and demagogue   claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man     During the 1832 Presidential Election the rechartering of the Second National Bank became the primary issue    The election also demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period    The Democratic Party s first national convention  held in Baltimore  in May 1832 nominated Jackson of Tennessee and Martin Van Buren of New York    The National Republican Party  who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831  nominated Henry Clay   senator from Kentucky and former Speaker of the House   and John Sergeant of Pennsylvania    The Anti Mason party  who had earlier held their convention also in Baltimore in September 1831  nominated William Wirt of Maryland and Amos Elmaker of Pennsylvania  both Jackson and Clay were masons    The two rival parties  however  proved to be no match for Jackson s popularity and the Democratic Party s strong political networks known as Hickory Clubs in state and local organization    Democratic newspapers  parades  barbecues  and rallies increased Jackson s popularity    Jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D C  Jackson won the election decisively by a landslide  receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes    Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes    Wirt received only 8 percent of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes while the Anti Masonic Party folded    Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank s recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank s control over the national economy     In 1833  Jackson removed federal deposits from the bank  whose money lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America  thus drastically increasing credit and speculation    Three years later  Jackson issued the Specie Circular   an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in  specie   gold or silver coins   The result was a great demand for specie  which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes  causing the Panic of 1837   which threw the national economy into a deep depression   It took years for the economy to recover from the damage  however the bulk of the damage was blamed on Martin Van Buren   who took office in 1837    Whitehouse gov notes   Basically the trouble was the 19th century cyclical economy of  boom and bust   which was following its regular pattern  but Jackson s financial measures contributed to the crash  His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks  wild speculation in lands  based on easy bank credit  had swept the West  To end this speculation  Jackson in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with hard moneygold or silver  In 1837 the panic began  Hundreds of banks and businesses failed  Thousands lost their lands  For about five years the United States was wracked by the worst depression thus far in its history   The U S  Senate censured Jackson on March 28  1834  for his action in removing U S  funds from the Bank of the United States    The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Jackson rival Senator Henry Clay   which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and Jackson    During the proceedings preceding the censure  Jackson called Clay  reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel   and the issue was highly divisive within the Senate  however the censure was approved 2620 on March 28    When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate  the censure was expunged after years of effort by Jackson supporters  led by Thomas Hart Benton   who though he had once shot Jackson in a street fight  eventually became an ardent supporter of the president       The first recorded physical attack on a U S  president was directed at Jackson  Jackson had ordered the dismissal of Robert B  Randolph from the navy for embezzlement   On May 6  1833  Jackson sailed on USS Cygnet to Fredericksburg  Virginia   where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of Mary Ball Washington   George Washington  s mother  During a stopover near Alexandria   Randolph appeared and struck the President  He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson s party  including the well known writer Washington Irving   Jackson decided not to press charges     On January 30  1835  what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol   When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R  Davis   Richard Lawrence   an unemployed house painter from England  aimed a pistol at Jackson  which misfired  Lawrence pulled out a second pistol  which also misfired  Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring    Lawrence was restrained  and legend says that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane  Others present  including David Crockett   restrained and disarmed Lawrence   Lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting  He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job  He claimed that with the President dead   money would be more plenty   a reference to Jackson s struggle with the Bank of the United States  and that he  could not rise until the President fell   Finally  he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English Kingspecifically  Richard III   dead since 1485and that Jackson was his clerk  He was deemed insane and was institutionalized   Afterwards  due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires  the pistols were tested and retested  Each time they performed perfectly  Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same Providence that they believed also protected their young nation  The incident became a part of the Jacksonian mythos   During the summer of 1835  controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation  as had similarly taken place during the divisive 18191820 Missouri Compromise debates    Northern abolitionists were sending anti slavery tracts through the U S  Postal system into the South    Pro slavery Southerners objected believing the tracts were  incendiary literature  and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti slavery tracts into the South  On July 29  a mob of 300 conservatives broke into the Post Office in Charleston  South Carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts  The Jackson Administration had Southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism    However  Jackson  who demanded sectional peace  desired to placate Southerners  at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of Northern Democrats  Jackson s Postmaster General Amos Kendall gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti slavery tracts  Jackson angrily denounced Northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published  Jackson  who wanted the matter quickly resolved  also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers    In February 1836  Senator John C  Calhoun   Jackson s former Vice President  authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti slavery tracts via the federal mail service  The bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the House  Many Southern postmasters  however  disregarded matters of federal law and simply refused to send the anti slavery tracts     In the same year another controversy took place  when abolitionists sent the U S  House of Representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in Washington  D C    This infuriated pro slavery Southerners  who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions  On December 18  1835 South Carolina congressman James H  Hammond strongly denounced abolitionists as  ignorant fanatics   Northern Whigs objected that anti slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden    Jackson wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly  South Carolina Representative Henry L  Pinckney drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as  sickly sentimentality   declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery  and tabled   gag rule   all further anti slavery petitions  Jackson leaders in Congress supported the measure  which was passed quickly and without any debate  temporarily suppressing pro abolitionist activities in Congress     In 1835  pro slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government  by May 1836  they had routed the Mexican military for the time being  establishing an independent Republic of Texas     The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States  However  Jackson was hesitant with recognizing Texas  unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico  and not wanting to make Texas an anti slavery issue during the 1836 election    The strategy worked  the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact  while Democratic candidate Van Buren was elected President  Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas  nominating a charg d affaires on the last day of his Presidency  March 3  1837     Jackson initially opposed any federal exploration scientific expeditions during his first term in office    The last scientific federally funded exploration expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led by Stephen H  Harriman on the Red River of the North   Jackson s predecessor John Q  Adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration expedition in 1828  but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort  When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed Adam s expedition plans  However  wanting to establish his presidential legacy  similar to Thomas Jefferson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition   Jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term    On May 18  1836 Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic United States Exploring Expedition   Jackson put Secretary of Navy Mahlon Dickerson in charge  to assemble suitable ships  officers  and scientific staff for the expedition  with a planned launch before Jackson s term of office expired  Dickerson however proved unfit for the task  preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838  under the next President  Martin Van Buren     One brig ship  USS Porpoise   later used in the expedition  having been laid down  built  and commissioned by Secretary Dickerson in May 1836  circumnavigated the world  explored and mapped the Southern Ocean   confirming the existence of the Antarctica continent     The national economy during the 1830s was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills  In January 1835  Jackson paid off the entire national debt  the only time in U S  history that has been accomplished      However  reckless speculation in land and railroads caused what became known as the Panic of 1837     Contributing factors included Jackson s veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused Western Banks to relax their lending standards  Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837  the Specie Circular   that mandated Western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver  and the Deposit and Distribution Act  that transferred federal monies from Eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks    Jackson s Specie Circular   although designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy  led many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver    The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain s economy that stopped investment in the United States  As a result  the U S  economy went into a depression  banks became insolvent  the national debt  previously paid off  increased  business failures rose  cotton prices dropped  and unemployment dramatically increased    The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound       In total Jackson appointed 24 federal judges  six Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States and eighteen judges to the United States district courts    After serving two terms as president  Jackson retired to his Hermitage plantation in 1837    He immediately began putting the Hermitage in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son  Andrew Jr  Although he suffered ill health  Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics    He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession  insisting   I will die with the Union     Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837   he was unpopular in his early retirement    Jackson continued to denounce the  perfidy and treachery  of banks and urged his successor  Martin Van Buren to repudiate the Specie Circular      Jackson died at his plantation on June 8  1845  at the age of 78  of chronic tuberculosis   dropsy   and heart failure   According to a newspaper account from the Boon Lick Times read    he  fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed     but he subsequently revived     Gen  Jackson died at the Hermitage at 6o clock P M  on Sunday the 8th instant  When the messenger finally came  the old soldier  patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach  He is gone  but his memory lives  and will continue to live      In his will  Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son  Andrew Jackson Jr   except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members     Shortly after Jackson first arrived in Nashville in 1788  he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockley Donelson  the widow of John Donelson   Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter  Rachel Donelson Robards   At the time  Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards  he was subject to fits of jealous rage    The two were separated in 1790  According to Jackson  he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce  However  the divorce had never been completed  making Rachel s marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid  After the divorce was officially completed  Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794    To complicate matters further  evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs  Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made    It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially  as long as they were recognized by the community   The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for Jackson  who deeply resented attacks on his wife s honor  By May 1806  Charles Dickinson had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper  and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a duel   Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot  Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first  hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness  Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson  Dickinson did fire first  hitting Jackson in the chest  The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed  Under the rules of dueling  Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him  Jackson s behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in Tennessee  who called it a brutal  cold blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent  vengeful man  As a result  he became a social outcast     Rachel died of a heart attack on December 22  1828  two weeks after her husband s victory in the election and two months before Jackson took office as President  Jackson described her symptoms as  excruciating pain in the left shoulder  arm  and breast     After struggling for three days  Rachel finally died  a distraught Jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body    She had been under extreme stress during the election  and she never did well when Jackson was away at war or work  Jackson blamed John Quincy Adams for Rachel s death because the Whig campaign of 1828 had repeatedly attacked the circumstances for Jackson s wedding to Rachel  He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave Adams     Jackson had three adopted sons  Theodore  an Indian about whom little is known    Andrew Jackson Jr   the son of Rachel s brother Severn Donelson  and Lyncoya  a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Creek War  Lyncoya died of tuberculosis in 1828  at the age of sixteen     The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children  John Samuel Donelson  Daniel Smith Donelson and Andrew Jackson Donelson were the sons of Rachel s brother Samuel Donelson  who died in 1804  Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel s orphaned grand nephew  Caroline Butler  Eliza Butler  Edward Butler  and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler  a family friend  They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father     The widower Jackson invited Rachel s niece Emily Donelson to serve as hostess at the White House  Emily was married to Andrew Jackson Donelson   who acted as Jackson s private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the American Party ticket  The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the Petticoat affair   and the two became estranged for over a year  They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess  Sarah Yorke Jackson   the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr   became co hostess of the White House in 1834  It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady  Sarah took over all hostess duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836  Jackson used Rip Raps as a retreat  visiting between August 19  1829 through August 16  1835     Jackson s quick temper was notorious  Brands says   His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him and defamed even his wife  Rachel  He dueled in her defense and his own  suffering grievous wounds that left him with bullet fragments lodged about his body     However  Remini is of the opinion that Jackson was often in control of his rage  and used it  and his fearsome reputation  as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs     Brands also notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper   On the last day of the presidency  Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets  that he  had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C  Calhoun      Jackson was a lean figure  standing at 6 feet  1 inch  1 85m  tall  and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds  64kg  on average  Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair  which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61  He had penetrating deep blue eyes  Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents  suffering from chronic headaches  abdominal pains  and a hacking cough  caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed  that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake   About a year after retiring the presidency    Jackson became a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville    Jackson was a Freemason  having been initiated at Harmony Lodge No  1 in Tennessee  he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee  He was the only U S  president to have served as Grand Master of a state s Grand Lodge until Harry S  Truman in 1945  His Masonic apron is on display in the Tennessee State Museum   An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage         Jackson remains one of the most studied and most controversial Americans of the 19th century      Historian Charles Sellers says  Andrew Jackson s masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage     His most controversial presidential actions included removal of the Indians from the southeast  the dismantling of the Bank of the United States  and his threat to use military force against the state of South Carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws  Not at all controversial was his great victory over the British at New Orleans in the last battle of the War of 1812  He was the main founder of the modern Democratic Party and remains its iconic hero  he was always a fierce partisan  with many friends and many enemies     Andrew Jackson is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on U S  Postage more than the usual two or three times  He died in 1845  but the U S  Post Office did not release a postage stamp in his honor until 18 years after his death  with the issue of 1863   a 2 cent black issue  commonly referred to by collectors as the   Black Jack    In contrast  the first Warren G  Harding stamp was released only one month after his death  Lincoln  one year exactly  As Jackson was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait  In all  Jackson has appeared on thirteen different U S  postage stamps   more than that of most U S  presidents  only Washington  Lincoln  and Franklin  who was not a president  have appeared more often      During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two Confederate postage stamps bearing Jackson s portrait  one a 2 cent red stamp and the other a 2 cent green stamp   both issued in 1863     The actor Hugh Sothern played the character of General Andrew Jackson in the 1938 film The Buccaneer   and Charlton Heston

President of the United States from 1977 to 1981  He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Carter Center    Carter  a Democrat raised in rural Georgia   was a peanut farmer who

a relatively close election  the Electoral College margin of 57 votes was the closest at that time since 1916    On his second day in office  Carter pardoned all evaders of the Vietnam War drafts  During his term as President  Carter created two new cabinet level departments  the Department of Energy and the Department of Education   He established a national energy policy that included conservation  price control  and new technology  In foreign affairs  Carter pursued the Camp David Accords   the Panama Canal Treaties   the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  SALT II

presidential tenure was marked by the 19791981 Iran hostage crisis   the 1979 energy crisis   the Three Mile Island nuclear accident   and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan   In response to the Soviet move he ended dtente  escalated the Cold War  and led the international boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow  By 1980  Carter s popularity had eroded such that  running for re election that year  he ran against Ted Kennedy in the Democratic Party s primaries for the presidential nomination   marking the most recent Democratic primary in which an incumbent faced opposition  Carter won the 1980 primary with a mere 51 13  of the vote  all incumbent candidates since have won at least 72 8  of their party s primary votes  but lost the general election in an electoral landslide to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan   who won 44 of 50 states   Although many consider him to have accomplished more with his post presidency work  his presidency has drawn medium low responses from historians  He set up the Carter Center in 1982 as his base for advancing human rights  He has also traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations  observe elections  and advance disease prevention and eradication in developing nations  Additionally  Carter is a key figure in the Habitat for Humanity project  Regarding current political views  he has criticized of some of Israel s actions and policies in regards to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict   He has vigorously opposed the Supreme Court s decision in Citizens United v  FEC to strike down McCain Feingold limits on campaign spending by corporations and unions  saying that America is  no longer a functioning democracy  and now has a system of  unlimited political bribery    He is a supporter of President Obama but has been critical of aspects of his foreign policy  particularly with regard to the use of drones and Obama s decision not to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp    In August 2015  at age 90  Carter was diagnosed with melanoma which had metastasized to his liver and brain  and he began treatment which included surgery  immunotherapy  and radiation therapy     Carter was born on October 1  1924  at the Wise Sanatorium in Plains  Georgia     note 1   He is a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter  who settled in Virginia in 1635  Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia  Established in Sumter County   Plains was a boomtown of 600 people when Carter was born  Carter s father  James Earl Carter  Sr    was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and had begun to invest in farmland  He had been a reserve second lieutenant in the U S  Army s Quartermaster Corps during World War I   Carter s mother  Bessie Lillian Gordy   was a nurse at the Wise hospital  Carter was the first of Earl and Lillian s children  they moved several times during his infancy     The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery  which was almost entirely populated by impoverished African American families  They eventually had three more children Gloria   Ruth   and Billy   Carter got along well with his parents  although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood  Although Earl was staunchly pro segregation  he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands  children  An enterprising teenager  Carter was given his own acre of Earl s farmland where he grew  packaged  and sold peanuts  Carter also rented out a section of tenant housing he had purchased     Carter attended the Plains High School from 1930  first grade  to 1941  The Great Depression had by then impoverished Archery and Plains  but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies  and Earl took a position as a community leader  Young Carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading    note 2   Carter s teacher  Julia Coleman  was an especially strong influence  As an adolescent  Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team  he also joined the Future Farmers of America and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking     Carter had long dreamed of attending the U S  Naval Academy in Annapolis   Meanwhile  he enrolled at Georgia Southwestern College in nearby Americus   After taking additional mathematics courses at Georgia Tech   he was finally admitted to the Naval Academy in 1943  With his diminutive stature  Carter barely met the minimum physical requirements for entry  He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet  in contrast to the academy s culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen  While at the academy  Carter fell in love with his sister Ruth s friend Rosalynn Smith  whom he would marry shortly after his graduation in 1946    Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 and was commissioned as an ensign     From 1946 to 1953  Carter and Rosalynn lived temporarily in Virginia  Hawaii  Connecticut  and California  as he served deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets     Promoted to a LTJG   he completed qualification for command of a diesel electric submarine  In late 1952  he was admitted to the US Navy s fledgling nuclear submarine program led by then Captain Hyman G  Rickover   Rickover s demands on his men and machines were legendary  and Carter later said that  next to his parents  Rickover was the greatest influence on his life     On December 12  1952  an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada  s Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown  The resulting explosion caused millions of liters of radioactive water to flood the reactor building s basement  and the reactor s core was no longer usable    Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U S  maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor    The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for a few minutes at a time  limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor  During and after his presidency  Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease development of a neutron bomb      Carter took non credit classes at Union College in Schenectady  New York  in 1953    Upon the death of his father that July  the family business became his  but deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult  Rosalynn had also grown comfortable with their life  Returning to small town life in Plains seemed  a monumental step backward   she said later  On the other hand  Carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his father s  Thus resigning his commission  Carter was honorably discharged from the Navy on October 9  1953       Earl Carter died a relatively wealthy man  having also recently been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives   However  between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs  his son Jimmy inherited comparatively little  For a year  Jimmy  Rosalynn  and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains  Carter is the only U S  president to have lived in housing subsidized for the poor  Knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects  however  Carter set out to expand the family s peanut growing business  The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult  as the harvest his first year failed due to drought  Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat  Meanwhile  he also took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business s books  Though they barely broke even the first year  the Carters grew the business and became quite successful       Racial tension was inflamed in Plains by the 1954 U S  Supreme Court  s anti segregation ruling in Brown v  Board of Education   Carter was in favor of racial tolerance and integrationat one point  the local White Citizens  Council boycotted his peanut warehouse when he refused to join thembut he often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies  By 1961 he was a prominent member of the community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board  where he began to speak more loudly in favor of school integration    A state Senate seat was opened by the dissolution of Georgia s County Unit System in 1962  Carter announced his run for the seat 15 days before the election  Rosalynn  who had an instinct for politics and organization  was instrumental to his campaign  The initial results showed Carter losing  but this was the result of fraudulent voting orchestrated by Joe Hurst  the sheriff of Quitman County   Carter challenged the results  when fraud was confirmed  a new election was held  which he won     The Civil Rights Movement was well underway as Carter took office  He and his family had become staunch John F  Kennedy supporters  In 1962  the town of Americus was the site of mass beatings and incarcerations of black protesters  echoing similar unrest throughout the country  Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first  even as it polarized much of the county  to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues  He did speak up on a few divisive issues  giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the Georgia Constitution which  he felt  implied a compulsion to practice religion    A diligent legislator  Carter took speed reading courses to keep up with the workload  Within two years his connections landed him on the state Democratic Executive Committee  where he helped rewrite the state party s rules  He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission  which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration  When Bo Callaway was elected to the U S  House of Representatives in November 1964  Carter immediately began planning to unseat him  The two had previously clashed over which two year college would be expanded to a four year college program by the state  Carter wanted it to go to Georgia Southwestern College in Americus  but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus   Carter saw Callaway  a Republican   as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics     Carter was re elected in 1964 to serve a second two year term  For a time in the State Senate  he chaired its Education Committee  he also sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term  Before his term ended he contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four year program  He leveraged his regional planning work  giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters  The last day of the term  he announced his run for Congress     The congressional race was shaken up in mid May when Callaway dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia instead  Callaway was a very strong candidate  and state Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since Reconstruction   Carter soon decided to follow Callaway and run for governor himself  In the Democratic primary he ran as a moderate alternative to both the liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox   In a press conference he described his ideology as  Conservative  moderate  liberal and middle of the road      I believe I am a more complicated person than that     He lost the Democratic primary  but drew enough votes as a third place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox  A chain of events then resulted in Maddox  the dark horse candidate   being elected governor    note 3   The result was a sharp blow to Carter  who was left deeply in debt  His attempt to rescue the race from Callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist Maddox  which he considered an even worse outcome     Carter returned to his agriculture business and  during the next four years  carefully planned his next campaign for Governor in 1970  This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter  he grew increasingly evangelical  undertaking several religious missions in other states  Inspired by his sister Ruth and liberal theologians such as Reinhold Niebuhr   he declared himself born again   a growing movement in 1960s America  His last child Amy was born around this time       The liberal former governor  Carl Sanders   was Carter s main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary  Carter ran a more modern campaign this time around  employing printed graphics and statistical analysis  Responding to poll data  Carter leaned more conservative than before  He positioned himself as a populist   quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth  labeling him  Cufflinks Carl   and associating him with the national Democratic Party  He accused Sanders of corruption  but when pressed by the media  could come up with no evidence      Throughout the campaign Carter sought both the black vote and the  Wallace vote   after the prominent segregationist George Wallace   While he met with black figures such as Martin Luther King  Sr  and Andrew Young   and visited many black owned businesses  he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia  He implied support or dislike of private schools depending on the audience  The appeal to racism became more blatant over time  Carter s senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players       That September  Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent  leading to a runoff  The campaign grew even more bitter  Carter s campaign criticized Sanders for supporting Martin Luther King  Jr  Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the votewinning 7 percent of the black voteand went on to win the general election easily over the Republican Hal Suit   a local news anchor  Once he was elected  Carter began to speak confidently against Georgia s racist politics  Leroy Johnson   a black state Senator  voiced his support for Carter  saying   I understand why he ran that kind of ultra conservative campaign      I don t believe you can win this state without being a racist      Carter was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12  1971  He declared in his inaugural speech that  the time of racial segregation was over  No poor  rural  weak  or black person should ever again have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education  a job  or simple justice   The crowd was reportedly shocked by this message  contrasting starkly with Georgia s political culture and particularly Carter s campaign  The many segregationists who had supported Carter during the race felt betrayed  Time magazine ran a story on the progressive   New South   governors elected that year in a May 1971 issue  featuring a cover illustration of Carter         Lester Maddox   Carter s predecessor as governor  became lieutenant governor   Carter had endorsed Maddox  although the two did not campaign as a ticket   The two found little common ground during their four years of service  often publicly feuding with each other    Richard Russell  Jr    then President pro tempore of the United States Senate   died in office during Carter s second week in office  the newly inaugurated governor appointed David H  Gambrell   state Democratic Party chair  to fill Russell s unexpired term in the Senate     With Carter s reluctance to engage in back slapping and political favors  the legislature found him frustrating to work with      He looked to aggressively expand the governor s authority while reducing the complexity of the state government  Therefore  he negotiated a bill allowing him to propose executive restructuring and to force a vote on it  He implemented zero based budgeting within state departments and added a Judicial Selection Commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor    The reorganization plan was submitted in January 1972  but had a cool reception in the legislature  After two weeks of negotiations it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session    Ultimately he merged about 300 state agencies into 22a fact he would emphasize in his presidential runalthough it is disputed that there were any overall cost savings from doing so     Civil rights were a heartfelt priority for Carter  He expanded the number of black state employees  judges  and board members  He hired Rita Jackson Samuels  a black woman  to advise him on potential appointments    He placed portraits of Martin Luther King  Jr   and two other prominent black Georgians in the capitol building  even as the Ku Klux Klan picketed the unveiling ceremony    Still  Carter tried to keep his conservative allies comfortable  He co sponsored an anti busing resolution with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference    After the U S  Supreme Court threw out Georgia s death penalty statute in Furman v  Georgia  1972   Carter signed a revised death penalty statute which addressed the court s objections  thus re introducing the practice in the state  Carter later regretted endorsing the death penalty  saying   I didn t see the injustice of it as I do now      Carter pushed reforms through the legislature to provide equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of Georgia  set up community centers for mentally handicapped children  and increased educational programs for convicts  He took pride in his program for the appointment of judges and state government officials  Under this program  all such appointments were based on merit  rather than political influence       In one of his more controversial decisions    he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia s Flint River   After surveying the river and the literature himself  he argued that the U S  Army Corps of Engineers was underestimating both the project s cost and its impact on the region  The veto won the attention of environmentalists nationwide    When Lieutenant William Calley was convicted in a military trial and sentenced to life for his role in the My Lai Massacre in South Vietnam   a politically polarizing issue  Carter avoided paying direct tribute to Calley  He instead instituted  American Fighting Man s Day  and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of the military     Looking toward a potential presidential run  Carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances  He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention   where the liberal U S  Senator George McGovern was the likely presidential nominee  Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative  anti McGovern voters  so that the convention would consider him for McGovern s running mate on a compromise ticket  He endorsed Senator Henry  Scoop  Jackson   in part to distance himself from George Wallace  Carter was still fairly obscure at the time  and his attempt at triangulation failed  the 1972 Democratic ticket went to McGovern and Senator Thomas Eagleton      After McGovern s loss in November 1972  Carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff  He had quietly decided to begin putting a presidential bid together  He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the National Governors Association to boost his visibility  On David Rockefeller  s endorsement he was named to the Trilateral Commission in April 1973  The following year he was named chairman of the Democratic National Committee  s congressional  as well as gubernatorial  campaigns    In 1973 he appeared on the game show What s My Line   where a group of celebrity panelists would try to guess his occupation  None recognized him and it took several rounds of question and answer before movie critic Gene Shalit correctly guessed he was a governor     When Carter entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries in 1976  he was considered to have little chance against nationally better known politicians  his name recognition was two percent  As the Watergate scandal of President Nixon was still fresh in the voters  minds  Carter s position as an outsider  distant from Washington  D C   became an asset  He promoted government reorganization  Carter published Why Not the Best  in June 1976 to help introduce himself to the American public     Carter became the front runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary   He used a two prong strategy  In the South  which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama s George Wallace   Carter ran as a moderate favorite son  When Wallace proved to be a spent force  Carter swept the region  In the North  Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters  he had little chance of winning a majority in most states  He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc  Carter s strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there  He had traveled over 50 000 miles  visited 37 states  and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidates announced that they were in the race    Initially dismissed as a regional candidate  Carter proved to be the only Democrat with a truly national strategy  and he clinched the nomination    citation needed    The national news media discovered and promoted Carter  as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book The Carter Presidency and Beyond    What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media  It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge  propelling him rocket like to the top of the opinion polls  This helped Carter win key primary election victories  enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President elect in the short space of 9 months     Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of Playboy for the November 1976 issue  which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election  While discussing his religion s view of pride  Carter said   I ve looked on a lot of women with lust  I ve committed adultery in my heart many times     He is the only interviewee of Playboy to become US president     As late as January 26  1976  Carter was the first choice of only four percent of Democratic voters  according to a Gallup poll     citation needed   Yet  by mid March 1976 Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination  he also led President Ford by a few percentage points   according to Shoup     He chose Senator Walter F  Mondale as his running mate  He attacked Washington in his speeches  and offered a religious salve for the nation s wounds     Carter began the race with a sizable lead over Ford  who narrowed the gap during the campaign  but lost to Carter in a narrow defeat on November 2  1976  Carter won the popular vote by 50 1 percent to 48 0 percent for Ford  and received 297 electoral votes to Ford s 240  Carter became the first contender from the Deep South to be elected President since the 1848 election   Carter carried fewer states than Ford23 states to the defeated Ford s 27yet Carter won with the largest percentage of the popular vote  50 1 percent  of any non incumbent since Dwight Eisenhower     citation needed    Carter s tenure was a time of continuing inflation and recession   as well as an energy crisis   Among his first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War  era draft evaders       On January 7  1980  Carter signed Law H R  5860 aka Public Law 96 185 known as The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979  bailing out Chrysler Corporation   He canceled military pay raises during a time of high inflation and government deficits    citation needed    Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world  most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the Camp David Accords   giving back the Panama Canal   and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev   His final year was marred by the Iran hostage crisis   which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan     There is strong evidence that he supported and helped to instigate the IranIraq War      On November 4  1979 a group of Iranian students  belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam s Line   who were supporting the Iranian Revolution   took over the U S  Embassy in Tehran     Fifty two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for the next 444 days until January 20  1981  During the crisis  Carter remained in isolation in the White House for more than 100 days  until he left to participate in the lighting of the National Menorah on the ellipse    On April 24  1980  Carter ordered Operation Eagle Claw to try free the hostages  The mission failed leaving eight American servicemen dead and the destruction of two aircraft   On April 18  1977  Carter delivered a televised speech declaring that the U S  energy crisis during the 1970s was the moral equivalent of war   He encouraged energy conservation by all U S  citizens and installed solar water heating panels on the White House       He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House     In 1978  Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls  New York   More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood  which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill  The Superfund law was created in response to the situation    Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses  the 99th Street School  and the 93rd Street School  which were built on top of the dump  and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes  This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken  Carter acknowledged that several more  Love Canals  existed across the country  and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was  one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era      In 1977  Carter appointed Alfred E  Kahn   a professor of economics at Cornell University   to be chair of the Civil Aeronautics Board  CAB   He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry  supported by leading economists  leading  think tanks  in Washington  a civil society coalition advocating the reform  patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck and rail reform efforts   the head of the regulatory agency  Senate leadership  the Carter administration  and even some in the airline industry  This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978    citation needed    The Airline Deregulation Act   Pub L  95504   was signed into law by President Carter on October 24  1978  The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares  routes and market entry  of new airlines  from commercial aviation   The Civil Aeronautics Board  s powers of regulation were to be phased out  eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares  The Act did not remove or diminish the FAA s regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety    citation needed    In 1979  Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt   hops   and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of Prohibition in the United States     This Carter deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft microbrew culture in the United States  with 3 418 micro breweries  brewpubs  and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2014     In response to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan   Carter called for a boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow  which raised a bitter controversy    It was the only time since the founding of the modern Olympics in 1896 that the United States had not participated in a Summer or Winter Olympics  The Soviet Union retaliated by boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles  It did not withdraw troops from Afghanistan until 1989  eight years after Carter left office    Carter later wrote that the most intense and mounting opposition to his policies came from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party  which he attributed to Ted Kennedy  s ambition to replace him as president    Kennedy surprised his supporters by running a weak campaign  and Carter won most of the primaries and secured renomination  However  Kennedy had mobilized the liberal wing of the Democratic Party  which gave Carter weak support in the fall election     Carter s campaign for re election in 1980 was one of the most difficult  and least successful  in history  He faced strong challenges from the right  Republican Ronald Reagan    the center  independent John B  Anderson    and the left  Democrat Ted Kennedy    He had to run against his own   stagflation   ridden economy  while the hostage crisis in Iran dominated the news every week  He alienated liberal college students  who were expected to be his base  by re instating registration for the military draft  His campaign manager and former appointments secretary  Timothy Kraft   stepped down some five weeks before the general election amid what turned out to have been an uncorroborated allegation of cocaine use    Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan in a landslide  and the Senate went Republican for the first time since 1952     In 1981  Carter returned to Georgia to his peanut farm  which he had placed into a blind trust during his presidency to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest  He found that the trustees had mismanaged the trust  leaving him more than one million dollars in debt  In the years that followed  he has led an active life  establishing the Carter Center  building his presidential library  teaching at Emory University in Atlanta  Georgia   and writing numerous books    He has also contributed to the expansion of Habitat for Humanity  to build affordable housing  Since early September 2012  Carter has been alive longer after leaving the White House than any other U S  President     Carter has been involved in a variety of national and international public policy  conflict resolution  human rights and charitable causes  In 1982  he established The Carter Center in Atlanta to advance human rights and alleviate human suffering  The non profit  nongovernmental Center promotes democracy  mediates and prevents conflicts  and monitors the electoral process in support of free and fair elections  It also works to improve global health through the control and eradication of diseases such as Guinea worm disease   river blindness   malaria   trachoma   lymphatic filariasis   and schistosomiasis   It also works to diminish the stigma of mental illnesses and improve nutrition through increased crop production in Africa    citation needed    A major accomplishment of The Carter Center has been the elimination of more than 99percent of cases of Guinea worm disease   from an estimated 3 5million cases in 1986 to 148 reported cases in 2013    The Carter Center has monitored 96 elections in 38 countries since 1989    It has worked to resolve conflicts in Haiti   Bosnia   Ethiopia   North Korea   Sudan and other countries  Carter and the Center support human rights defenders around the world and have intervened with heads of state on their behalf    citation needed    In 2002  President Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work  to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts  to advance democracy and human rights  and to promote economic and social development  through The Carter Center    Three sitting presidents  Theodore Roosevelt   Woodrow Wilson   and Barack Obama   have received the prize  Carter is unique in receiving the award for his actions after leaving the presidency  He is  along with Martin Luther King  Jr    one of only two native Georgians to receive the Nobel     In 1994  North Korea had expelled investigators from the International Atomic Energy Agency and was threatening to begin processing spent nuclear fuel  In response  then President Clinton pressured for US sanctions and ordered large amounts of troops and vehicles into the area to brace for war    citation needed    Bill Clinton secretly recruited Carter to undertake a peace mission to North Korea    under the guise that it was a private mission of Carter s  Clinton saw Carter as a way to let North Korean President Kim Il sung back down without losing face     Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il sung  but went further and outlined a treaty  which he announced on CNN without the permission of the Clinton White House as a way to force the US into action   The Clinton Administration signed a later version of the Agreed Framework   under which North Korea agreed to freeze and ultimately dismantle its current nuclear program and comply with its nonproliferation obligations in exchange for oil deliveries  the construction of two light water reactors to replace its graphite reactors   and discussions for eventual diplomatic relations    citation needed    The agreement was widely hailed at the time as a significant diplomatic achievement      However  in December 2002  the Agreed Framework collapsed as a result of a dispute between the George W  Bush Administration and the North Korean government of Kim Jong il    In 2001  George W  Bush had taken a confrontational position toward North Korea  And in January 2002  Bush had named North Korea as part of an   Axis of Evil    Meanwhile  North Korea began developing the capability to enrich uranium    Bush Administration opponents of the Agreed Framework believed that the North Korean government never intended to give up a nuclear weapons program  However  supporters of the Agreed Framework believed that the agreement could have been successful  had it not been undermined by the Bush Administration     In August 2010  Carter traveled to North Korea in an attempt to secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes   Gomes  a U S  citizen   was sentenced to eight years of hard labor after being found guilty of illegally entering North Korea  Carter successfully secured the release     Carter and experts from The Carter Center assisted unofficial Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in designing a model agreement for peacecalled the Geneva Accord in 20022003     Carter has also in recent years become a frequent critic of Israel s policies in Lebanon   the West Bank   and Gaza        In 2006  at the UK Hay Festival   Carter stated that Israel has at least 150 nuclear weapons   He expressed his support for Israel as a country  but criticized its domestic and foreign policy   One of the greatest human rights crimes on earth is the starvation and imprisonment of 1 6m Palestinians   said Carter     He mentioned statistics showing nutritional intake of some Palestinian children was below that of the children of Sub Saharan Africa and described the European position on Israel as   supine       In April 2008  the London based Arabic newspaper Al Hayat reported that Carter met with exiled Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal on his visit to Syria   The Carter Center initially did not confirm nor deny the story  The US State Department considers Hamas a terrorist organization    Within this Mid East trip  Carter also laid a wreath on the grave of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah on April 14  2008    Carter said on April 23 that neither Condoleezza Rice nor anyone else in the State Department had warned him against meeting with Hamas leaders during his trip    Carter spoke to Mashaal on several matters  including  formulas for prisoner exchange to obtain the release of Corporal Shalit       In May 2007  while arguing that the United States should directly talk to Iran  Carter again stated that Israel has 150 nuclear weapons in its arsenal     In December 2008  Carter visited Damascus again  where he met with Syrian President Bashar al Assad   and the Hamas leadership  During his visit he gave an exclusive interview to Forward Magazine   the first ever interview for any American president  current or former  with a Syrian media outlet       Carter visited with three officials from Hamas who have been living at the International Red Cross office in Jerusalem since July 2010  Israel believes that these three Hamas legislators had a role in the 2006 kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit   and has a deportation order set for them     In August 2014  Carter was joined by Mary Robinson during the 2014 IsraelGaza conflict with the pair pressing for the inclusion of Hamas as an actor in peace talks with Israel  recognition of the group as a legitimate political entity  and the lifting of the siege of Gaza  The two Elders   in an op ed article in Foreign Policy   noted the recent unity deal between Hamas and Fatah when Hamas agreed with the Palestinian Authority to denounce violence  recognize Israel and adhere to past agreements  saying it presented an opportunity  Carter and Robinson called on the UN Security Council to act on what they described as the inhumane conditions in Gaza  and mandate an end to the siege     Carter held summits in Egypt and Tunisia in 19951996 to address violence in the Great Lakes region of Africa     Carter played a key role in negotiation of the Nairobi Agreement in 1999 between Sudan and Uganda      On June 18  2007  Carter  accompanied by his wife  arrived in Dublin  Ireland  for talks with President Mary McAleese and Bertie Ahern

 a biotech facility  an agricultural production cooperative  and a school for disabled children  and threw a pitch for an all star baseball game in Havana   The visit made Carter the first President of the United States  in or out of office  to visit the island since the Cuban revolution of 1959     Carter observed the Venezuela recall elections on August 15  2004  European Union observers had declined to participate  saying too many restrictions were put on them by the Hugo Chvez administration    A record number of voters turned out to defeat the recall attempt with a 59percent  no  vote    The Carter Center stated that the process  suffered from numerous irregularities   but said it did not observe or receive  evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the vote     On the afternoon of August 16  2004  the day after the vote  Carter and Organization of American States  OAS  Secretary General Csar Gaviria gave a joint press conference in which they endorsed the preliminary results announced by the National Electoral Council  The monitors  findings  coincided with the partial returns announced today by the National Elections Council   said Carter  while Gaviria added that the OAS electoral observation mission s members had  found no element of fraud in the process   Directing his remarks at opposition figures who made claims of  widespread fraud  in the voting  Carter called on all Venezuelans to  accept the results and work together for the future     A Penn  Schoen   Berland Associates  PSB  exit poll had predicted that Chvez would lose by 20percent  when the election results showed him to have won by 20percent  Douglas Schoen commented   I think it was a massive fraud     US News   World Report offered an analysis of the polls  indicating  very good reason to believe that the  Penn  Schoen   Berland  exit poll had the result right  and that Chvez s election officials and Carter and the American media got it wrong   The exit poll and the Venezuela government s control of election machines became the basis of claims of election fraud  However an Associated Press report states that Penn  Schoen   Berland used volunteers from pro recall organization Smate for fieldwork  and its results contradicted five other opposition exit polls     Following Ecuador  s severing of ties with Colombia in March 2008  Carter brokered a deal for agreement between the countries  respective presidents on the restoration of low level diplomatic relations announced June 8  2008       On November 18  2009  Carter visited Vietnam to build houses for the poor  The one week program  known as Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project 2009  built 32 houses in Dong Xa village  in the northern province of H i D  ng   The project launch was scheduled for November 14  according to the news source which quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga   Administered by the non governmental and non profit Habitat for Humanity International  HFHI   the annual program of 2009 would build and repair 166 homes in Vietnam and some other Asian countries with the support of nearly 3 000 volunteers around the world  the organization said on its website  HFHI has worked in Vietnam since 2001 to provide low cost housing  water  and sanitation solutions for the poor  It has worked in provinces like Ti n Giang and   ng Nai as well as Ho Chi Minh City      On July 18  2007  Carter joined Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg  South Africa  to announce his participation in The Elders   a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues    The Elders work globally  on thematic as well as geographically specific subjects  The organization s priority issue areas include the Israeli Palestinian conflict   the Korean Peninsula   Sudan   and South Sudan   sustainable development   and equality for girls and women      Carter has been actively involved in the work of The Elders  participating in visits to Cyprus   the Korean Peninsula   and the Middle East  among others   In October 2007  Carter toured Darfur with several of the Elders  including Desmond Tutu   Sudanese security prevented him from visiting a Darfuri tribal leader  leading to a heated exchange    He returned to Sudan with fellow Elder Lakhdar Brahimi in May 2012 as part of The Elders  efforts to encourage the presidents of Sudan and South Sudan to return to negotiations  and highlight the impact of the conflict on civilians       In November 2008  President Carter  former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan   and Graa Machel   wife of Nelson Mandela  were stopped from entering Zimbabwe   to inspect the human rights situation  by President Robert Mugabe  s government  The Elders instead made their assessment from South Africa  meeting with Zimbabwe and South Africa based leaders from politics  business  international organisations and civil society in Johannesburg     In 2001  Carter criticized President Bill Clinton s controversial pardon of Marc Rich   calling it  disgraceful  and suggesting that Rich s financial contributions to the Democratic Party were a factor in Clinton s action     In June 2005  Carter urged the closing of the Guantanamo Bay Prison in Cuba  which has been a focal point for recent claims of prisoner abuse      In September 2006  Carter was interviewed on the BBC s current affairs program Newsnight   voicing his concern at the increasing influence of the Religious Right on US politics     In September 2009  Carter put weight behind allegations by Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez   pertaining to United States involvement in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d tat attempt by a civilian military junta   saying that Washington knew about the coup and may have taken part     On June 16  2011  the 40th anniversary of Richard Nixon  s official declaration of America s War on Drugs   Carter wrote an op ed in The New York Times urging the United States and the rest of the world to  Call Off the Global War on Drugs     explicitly endorsing the initiative released by the Global Commission on Drug Policy earlier that month and quoting a message he gave to Congress in 1977 saying that   p enalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself    Carter has also criticized the presidency of George W  Bush and the Iraq War   In a 2003 op ed in The New York Times   Carter warned against the consequences of a war in Iraq and urged restraint in use of military force    In March 2004  Carter condemned George W  Bush and Tony Blair for waging an unnecessary war  based upon lies and misinterpretations  to oust Saddam Hussein   In August 2006  Carter criticized Blair for being  subservient  to the Bush administration and accused Blair of giving unquestioning support to Bush s Iraq policies    In a May 2007 interview with the Arkansas Democrat Gazette   he said   I think as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world  this administration has been the worst in history   when it comes to foreign affairs      Two days after the quote was published  Carter told NBC s Today that the  worst in history  comment was  careless or misinterpreted   and that he  wasn t comparing this administration with other administrations back through history  but just with President Nixon s     The day after the  worst in history  comment was published  White House spokesman Tony Fratto said that Carter had become  increasingly irrelevant with these kinds of comments      On May 19  2007  Blair made his final visit to Iraq before stepping down as British Prime Minister   and Carter criticized him afterward  Carter told the BBC that Blair was  apparently subservient  to Bush and criticized him for his  blind support  for the Iraq war    Carter described Blair s actions as  abominable  and stated that the British Prime Minister s  almost undeviating support for the ill advised policies of President Bush in Iraq have been a major tragedy for the world   Carter said he believes that had Blair distanced himself from the Bush administration during the run up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003   it might have made a crucial difference to American political and public opinion  and consequently the invasion might not have gone ahead  Carter states that  one of the defenses of the Bush administration    has been  okay  we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because Great Britain is backing us  So I think the combination of Bush and Blair giving their support to this tragedy in Iraq has strengthened the effort and has made the opposition less effective  and prolonged the war and increased the tragedy that has resulted   Carter expressed his hope that Blair s successor  Gordon Brown   would be  less enthusiastic  about Bush s Iraq policy     Due to his status as former President  Carter was a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention   Carter announced his endorsement of Senator  now president  Barack Obama  Speaking to the Syrian English monthly Forward Magazine of Syria   Carter was asked to give one word that came to mind when mentioning President George W  Bush  His answer was  the end of a very disappointing administration  His reaction to mentioning Barack Obama was  honesty  intelligence  and politically adept     Carter has criticized the Obama administration for its use of drone strikes against suspected terrorists  Carter also said that he disagrees with President Obama s decision to keep the Guantnamo Bay detention camp open  saying that the inmates  have been tortured by waterboarding more than 100 times or intimidated with semiautomatic weapons  power drills or threats to sexually assault their mothers   He claimed that the U S  government had no moral leadership  and was committing human rights violations  and is no longer  the global champion of human rights      In July 2013  Carter expressed his criticism of current federal surveillance programs as disclosed by Edward Snowden indicating that  America has no functioning democracy at this moment        Carter has been a prolific author in his post presidency  writing 21 of his 23 books  Among these is one he co wrote with his wife  Rosalynn   and a children s book illustrated by his daughter  Amy   They cover a variety of topics  including humanitarian work  aging  religion  human rights  and poetry    citation needed    In a 2007 speech to Brandeis University  Carter stated   I have spent a great deal of my adult life trying to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors  based on justice and righteousness for the Palestinians  These are the underlying purposes of my new book      In his book Palestine  Peace Not Apartheid   published in November 2006  Carter states   Israel s continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land     He declares that Israel s current policies in the Palestinian territories constitute  a system of apartheid   with two peoples occupying the same land  but completely separated from each other  with Israelis totally dominant and suppressing violence by depriving Palestinians of their basic human rights     In an Op Ed titled  Speaking Frankly about Israel and Palestine   published in the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers  Carter states   The ultimate purpose of my book is to present facts about the Middle East that are largely unknown in America  to precipitate discussion and to help restart peace talks  now absent for six years  that can lead to permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors  Another hope is that Jews and other Americans who share this same goal might be motivated to express their views  even publicly  and perhaps in concert  I would be glad to help with that effort     While some such as a former Special Rapporteur for both the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the International Law Commission  as well as a member of the Israeli Knesset have praised Carter for speaking frankly about Palestinians in Israeli occupied lands   others including the envoy to the Middle East under Clinton  as well as the first director of the Carter Center      have accused him of anti Israeli bias  Specifically  these critics have alleged significant factual errors  omissions and misstatements in the book       The 2007 documentary film  Man from Plains   follows President Carter during his tour for the controversial book and other humanitarian efforts     In December 2009  Carter apologized for any words or deeds that may have upset the Jewish community in an open letter meant to improve an often tense relationship  He said he was offering an Al Het   a prayer said on Yom Kippur   the Jewish Day of Atonement     After Carter left the presidency  his interest in the developing countries led him to having a close relationship with Agha Hasan Abedi   the founder of Bank of Credit and Commerce International  BCCI   Abedi was a Pakistani  whose bank had offices and business in a large number of developing countries  He was introduced to Carter in 1982 by Bert Lance  one of Carter s closest friends   Unknown to Carter  BCCI had secretly purchased an interest in 1978 in National Bank of Georgia  which had previously been run by Lance and had made loans to Carter s peanut business   Abedi made generous donations to the Carter Center and the Global 2000 Project  Abedi also traveled with Carter to at least seven countries in connection with Carter s charitable activities  The main purpose of Abedi s association with Carter was not charitable activities  but to enhance BCCI s influence  in order to open more offices and develop more business  In 1991  BCCI was seized by regulators  amid allegations of criminal activities  including illegally having control of several U S  banks  Just prior to the seizure  Carter began to disassociate himself from Abedi and the bank     Despite being a Democrat  Carter endorsed former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in the Republican party 2012 Presidential primary in mid September 2011  not because he supported Romney  but because he felt Obama s re election bid would be strengthened in a race against Romney    Carter added that he thought Mitt Romney would lose in a match up against Obama and that he supported the president s re election     Carter addressed the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina by videotape  and did not attend the convention in person     Carter has participated in many ceremonial events such as the opening of his own presidential library and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan  George H  W  Bush  and Bill Clinton  He has also participated in many forums  lectures  panels  funerals and other events  Carter delivered a eulogy at the funeral of Coretta Scott King and  most recently  at the funeral of his former political rival  but later his close  personal friend and diplomatic collaborator  Gerald Ford     citation needed    President Jimmy Carter serves as an Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project     The World Justice Project works to lead a global  multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity     Carter serves as Honorary Chair for the Continuity of Government Commission  he was co chair with Gerald Ford until the latter s death   The Commission recommends improvements to continuity of government measures for the federal government    citation needed    Although  personally opposed  to abortion  after the landmark US Supreme Court decision Roe v  Wade   410 US 113  1973   Carter supported legalized abortion    As president  he did not support increased federal funding for abortion services  He was criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union for not doing enough to find alternatives     In a March 29  2012 interview with Laura Ingraham   Carter expressed his current view of abortion and his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more pro life    I never have believed that Jesus Christ would approve of abortions and that was one of the problems I had when I was president having to uphold Roe v  Wade and I did everything I could to minimize the need for abortions  I made it easy to adopt children for instance who were unwanted and also initiated the program called Women and Infant Children or WIC program that s still in existence now  But except for the times when a mother s life is in danger or when a pregnancy is caused by rape or incest I would certainly not or never have approved of any abortions  I ve signed a public letter calling for the Democratic Party at the next convention to espouse my position on abortion which is to minimize the need  requirement for abortion and limit it only to women whose life   sic     are in danger or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest  I think if the Democratic Party would adopt that policy that would be acceptable to a lot of people who are now estranged from our party because of the abortion issue      During his presidential campaigns  he expressed his opposition to the death penalty  as had George McGovern  Two successive nominees  Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis   also opposed the death penalty    Carter is known for his strong opposition to the death penalty  in his Nobel Prize lecture  he urged  prohibition of the death penalty     Carter has continued to speak out against the death penalty in the US and abroad     In a letter to the Governor of New Mexico  Bill Richardson   Carter urged the governor to sign a bill to eliminate the death penalty and institute life in prison without parole instead  New Mexico abolished the death penalty in 2009  Carter wrote   As you know  the United States is one of the few countries  along with nations such as Saudi Arabia  China  and Cuba  which still carry out the death penalty despite the ongoing tragedy of wrongful conviction and gross racial and class based disparities that make impossible the fair implementation of this ultimate punishment     In 2012  Carter wrote an op ed in the LA Times supporting passage of a state referendum which would have ended the death penalty  He opened the article   The process for administering the death penalty in the United States is broken beyond repair  and it is time to choose a more effective and moral alternative  California voters will have the opportunity to do this on election day      Carter has also called for commutations of death sentences for many death row inmates  including Brian K  Baldwin  executed in 1999 in Alabama      Kenneth Foster  sentence in Texas commuted in 2007      and Troy Anthony Davis  executed in Georgia in 2011      In October 2000  Carter  a third generation Southern Baptist  announced that he was severing connections to the Southern Baptist Convention over its opposition to women as pastors  What led Carter to take this action was a doctrinal statement by the Convention  adopted in June 2000  advocating a literal interpretation of the Bible   This statement followed a position of the Convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands  Carter described the reason for his decision as due to   an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them   The New York Times called Carter s action  the highest profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention      In subsequent years  Carter has joined with other world leaders who have spoken out about the subjugation of women by religious and other institutions  On July 15  2009  Carter wrote an opinion piece about equality for women in which he stated that he chooses equality for women over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment  He said that the view that women are inferior is not confined to one faith   nor  tragically does its influence stop at the walls of the church  mosque  synagogue or temple   Carter stated   The truth is that male religious leaders have hadand still havean option to interpret holy teachings either to exalt or subjugate women  They have  for their own selfish ends  overwhelmingly chosen the latter  Their continuing choice provides the foundation or justification for much of the pervasive persecution and abuse of women throughout the world  This is in clear violation not just of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but also the teachings of Jesus Christ  the Apostle Paul  Moses and the prophets  Muhammad  and founders of other great religionsall of whom have called for proper and equitable treatment of all the children of God  It is time we had the courage to challenge these views     In 2014  he published A Call to Action  Women  Religion  Violence  and Power      Carter has publicly expressed support for assault weapons bans and background checks    In May 1994  Carter  along with former presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan   wrote to the U S  House of Representatives in support of banning  semi automatic assault guns     In a February 2013 appearance on Piers Morgan Tonight   Carter agreed that if the assault weapons ban did not pass it would be mainly due to the National Rifle Association and its pressure on  weak kneed  politicians     Carter ignited debate in September 2009 when he stated   I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man  that he is African American       Obama disagreed with Carter s assessment  On CNN Obama stated   Are there people out there who don t like me because of race  I m sure there are    that s not the overriding issue here      In a 2008 interview with Amnesty International   Carter criticized the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay   saying that it  contravenes the basic principles on which this nation was founded     He stated that the next President should make the promise that the United States will  never again torture a prisoner      Carter and his wife  Rosalynn   are well known for their work as volunteers with Habitat for Humanity   a Georgia based philanthropy that helps low income working people around the world to build and buy their own homes and access clean water     Carter s hobbies include painting    fly fishing   woodworking  cycling  tennis  and skiing     From a young age  Carter showed a deep commitment to Christianity   He teaches Sunday school and is a deacon at the Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains         As president  Carter prayed several times a day  and professed that Jesus Christ was the driving force in his life  Carter had been greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man  It asked   If you were arrested for being a Christian  would there be enough evidence to convict you     The New York Times noted that Carter had been instrumental in moving evangelical Christianity closer to the American mainstream during and after his presidency     In 2000  Carter severed his membership with the Southern Baptist Convention   saying the group s doctrines did not align with his Christian beliefs  In April 2006  Carter  former President Bill Clinton  and Mercer University President Bill Underwood initiated the New Baptist Covenant   The broadly inclusive movement seeks to unite Baptists of all races  cultures and convention affiliations  Eighteen Baptist leaders representing more than 20million Baptists across North America backed the group as an alternative to the Southern Baptist Convention   The group held its first meeting in Atlanta  January 30 through February 1  2008     Carter had three younger siblings  sisters Gloria Carter Spann  19261990  and Ruth Carter Stapleton  19291983   and brother Billy Carter  19371988     Cousins to Carter included politician Hugh Carter and musician June Carter Cash      Carter and Rosalynn Smith were married in 1946  Together  they have three sons  one daughter  eight grandsons  three granddaughters  and two great grandsons  They celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary in July 2011  making them the second longest wed Presidential couple after George and Barbara Bush   Prior to this milestone  their long term marriage surpassed that of John and Abigail Adams on July 10  2000  Their eldest son Jack Carter was the 2006 Democratic candidate for U S  Senate in Nevada before losing to the Republican incumbent  John Ensign   Carter grandson Jason Carter is a former Georgia State Senator   and in 2014 was the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia   losing to the Republican incumbent  Nathan Deal    On August 3  2015  Carter underwent elective surgery to remove  a small mass  on his liver   and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be  excellent   On August 12  however  Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had spread elsewhere in his body   without specifying where the cancer had originated    On August 20  he disclosed that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver  and that he had begun treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and was about to start radiation therapy   His healthcare is being managed by Emory Healthcare of Atlanta   The former President has an extensive family history of cancer  including both of his parents and all three of his siblings     Carter has planned to be buried in front of his home in Plains  Georgia  Carter noted in 2006 that a funeral in Washington  D C  with visitation at the Carter Center was planned as well     The Independent writes   Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president     While he began his term with a 66percent approval rating    this had dropped to 34percent approval by the time he left office  with 55percent disapproving     In the wake of Nixon s Watergate Scandal   exit polls from the 1976 Presidential election suggested that many still held Gerald Ford  s pardon of Nixon against him    By comparison Carter seemed a sincere  honest  and well meaning Southerner     In the 1980 campaign  former California Governor Ronald Reagan projected an easy self confidence  in contrast to Carter s serious and introspective temperament  What many people believed to be Carter s personal attention to detail  his pessimistic attitude  his seeming indecisiveness and weakness with people were accentuated in contrast to Reagan s charismatic charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates      Reagan used the economic problems  Iran hostage crisis   and lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader  Carter was the first elected president since Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid    citation needed    In the years since then  his reputation has much improved  Carter s presidential approval rating  at 31percent just prior to the 1980 election  was polled in early 2009 at 64 percent    His post Presidency activities have been favorably received  Carter believes that George H  W  Bush   who actively sought him out and was far more courteous and interested in his advice than Reagan  contributed to the rise in his reputation     Carter s presidency was initially viewed by most as a failure        In historical rankings of US presidents   the Carter presidency has ranged from No  19 to No  34  Although his presidency received mixed reception  his peace keeping and humanitarian efforts since he left office have made Carter renowned as one of the most successful ex Presidents in American history       The documentary Back Door Channels  The Price of Peace  2009  credits Carter s efforts at Camp David  which brought peace between Israel and Egypt  with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East  The film opened the 2009 Monte Carlo Television Festival in an invitation only royal screening   on June 7  2009 at the Grimaldi

with Imperial Japan was expected to last another year or more  Truman approved the use of atomic weapons against Japan   intending to force Japan s surrender and spare American lives in a planned invasion   the decision remains controversial  His presidency was a turning point in foreign affairs   as his government supported an internationalist foreign policy in conjunction with European allies  Following the war  Truman assisted in the founding of the United Nations   issued the Truman Doctrine to contain communism  and passed the  13billion Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe  including the Axis Powers   whereas the wartime allied Soviet Union became the peacetime enemy  and the Cold War began  He oversaw the Berlin Airlift of 1948 and the creation of NATO in 1949  When communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950  he immediately sent in U S  troops and gained UN approval for the Korean War     After initial success  the UN forces were thrown back by Chinese intervention and the conflict was stalemated through the final years of Truman s presidency   On domestic issues  bills endorsed by Truman often faced opposition from a conservative Congress dominated by the South  but his administration successfully guided the American economy through post war economic challenges  He said civil rights was a moral priority and in 1948 submitted the first comprehensive legislation  in addition  he issued Executive Orders the same year to start racial integration in the military and federal agencies  Corruption in Truman s administration  which was linked to certain

legal blindness  in the left    The second time he took the test  he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart     When the United States entered the Great War   Truman rejoined the Guard  although as the sole male in the family he was exempt from conscription   To his surprise  the men elected Truman as an officer  making him first lieutenant of a battery  Before deployment to France  Truman was sent to Camp Doniphan   Fort Sill   near Lawton  Oklahoma   for training  He ran the camp canteen with Edward Jacobson   a clothing store clerk he knew from Kansas City  under the two men  the canteen returned  10 000 in dividends in six months    At Fort Sill  Truman met Lieutenant James M  Pendergast  nephew of Thomas Joseph  Tom  Pendergast   a Kansas City political boss  a connection that was to have a profound influence on Truman s later life       In mid 1918  about one million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Forces were in France  Promoted to captain   Truman in July 1918 became battery commander in an artillery battery in France  His new unit  Battery D  129th Field Artillery   60th Brigade  35th Infantry Division   was known for its discipline problems  and Truman was initially unpopular    During a sudden attack by the Germans in the Vosges Mountains   soldiers began to flee  Using profanity that he had learned while working on the Santa Fe railroad  Truman encouraged his men to stay and fight  they were so surprised to hear Truman use such language that they immediately obeyed     On September 26  1918  at the opening of the Meuse Argonne Offensive   Truman s unit joined in a massive pre arranged assault barrage  They advanced with difficulty over pitted terrain to follow the infantry  and when they were west of Cheppy   they set up an observation post  Through his binoculars on September 27  Truman saw an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring 28th Division   Truman s orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division  but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns  he ordered his men to open fire and scattered the enemy  Truman was given a dressing down by his commander  Colonel Karl D  Klemm  but he was not court martialed  Truman s decision probably saved American lives that day       In other action during the Meuse Argonne fighting  Truman provided support for George S  Patton  s tank brigade    On November 11  1918  his artillery unit fired some of the last shots of World War I before the armistice took effect at 11am  Under Truman s command in France  the battery did not lose a single man  and his men presented Truman with a large loving cup after their return to the United States     The war was a transformative experience that brought out Truman s leadership qualities  Despite beginning 1917 as a family farmer who had been unsuccessful in several business ventures  Truman achieved a war record and gained leadership experience that supported his postwar political career in Missouri     Young Truman was brought up in the Presbyterian and Baptist churches  he avoided revivals and sometimes ridiculed revivalist preachers  He rarely spoke about religion  which to him primarily meant ethical behavior along traditional Protestant lines  Most of the soldiers he commanded in the war were Catholics  and he got along with Jews and all denominations     At the war s conclusion  Truman was mustered out as a captain  He returned to Independence  where he married Bess Wallace on June 28  1919    The couple had one child  Mary Margaret Truman      Shortly before the wedding  Truman and Jacobson opened a haberdashery together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City   After brief initial success  the store went bankrupt during the recession of 1921     Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1934  when he did so with the aid of a supporter    Jacobson and Truman remained close friends  and Jacobson s advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U S  government s decision to recognize Israel     With the help of the Kansas City Democratic machine led by Tom Pendergast   Truman was elected in 1922 as a County Court judge of Jackson County  s eastern districtthis was an administrative rather than judicial position  somewhat similar to county commissioners elsewhere    Truman was not re elected in 1924  losing in a Republican wave led by President Calvin Coolidge   Two years selling automobile club memberships in the political wilderness convinced him that a public service career was safer for a man approaching middle age who had never been successful in the private sector     In 1926  Truman was elected as the presiding judge for the county court  similar to a county commission  with the support of the Pendergast machine  and was re elected in 1930  Truman helped coordinate the  Ten Year Plan   which transformed Jackson County and the Kansas City skyline with new public works projects  including an extensive series of roads and construction of a new Wight and Wight  designed County Court building  Also in 1926  he became president of the National Old Trails Road Association  NOTRA   He oversaw the dedication in the late 1920s of a series of 12 Madonna of the Trail monuments honoring pioneer women  which were installed along the trail       In 1933  Truman was named Missouri s director for the Federal Re Employment program  part of the Civil Works Administration   at the request of Postmaster General James Farley   This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D  Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election   The appointment confirmed Pendergast s control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power  It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman s avid support for the New Deal     After serving as a county judge  Truman wanted to run for Governor or Congress  but Pendergast rejected these ideas  Truman thought that he would serve out his career in some well paying sinecure at the county level  After four other men turned him down  Pendergast reluctantly backed Truman as a Democratic candidate for the 1934 U S  Senate election for Missouri    During the Democratic primary   Truman defeated two congressmen  John J  Cochran and Jacob L  Milligan   with the solid support of Jackson County   which was crucial to his candidacy  as were the contacts he had made statewide as a county official  Truman defeated the incumbent Republican Roscoe C  Patterson by nearly 20 percentage points         Truman assumed office with a reputation as  the senator from Pendergast   Although he turned over patronage decisions to Pendergast  Truman always maintained that he voted his conscience  He later defended the patronage decisions by saying that  by offering a little to the machine   he  saved a lot       In his first term as a U S  Senator from Missouri  Truman spoke out against corporate greed and the dangers of Wall Street speculators and other moneyed special interests attaining too much influence in national affairs    He was largely ignored by Democratic President Roosevelt and had trouble with getting calls to the White House returned       During the US Senate election in 1940   United States Attorney Maurice Milligan and former governor Lloyd Stark both challenged Truman in the Democratic primary  Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast s imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year  the senator had remained loyal  having claimed that Republican judges  not the Roosevelt administration  were responsible for the boss  downfall    St  Louis party leader Robert E  Hannegan  s support of Truman proved crucial  he later brokered the deal that put Truman on the national ticket  In the end  Stark and Milligan both split up the anti Pendergast vote in the Senate Democratic primary and Truman won by a total of 8 000 votes  In the November election  Truman defeated Republican Manvel H  Davis by 5149      In late 1940  Truman traveled to various military bases  The waste and profiteering he saw led him to use his subcommittee chairmanship in the Committee on Military Affairs to begin investigations into abuses while the nation prepared for war  A separate committee to conduct a formal investigation was set up under Truman  the Roosevelt administration supported this plan rather than weather a more hostile probe by the House of Representatives  Chairmanship of what came to be known as the Truman Committee made him a national figure    Activities of the Truman Committee ranged from criticizing the   dollar a year men   hired by the government  many of whom proved ineffective  to investigating a shoddily built New Jersey housing project for war workers      The committee is reported to have saved as much as  15billion          its activities put Truman on the cover of Time magazine    According to the Senate s historical minutes  in leading the committee   Truman erased his earlier public image as an errand runner for Kansas City politicos  and  no senator ever gained greater political benefits from chairing a special investigating committee than did Missouri s Harry S  Truman      If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia  and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany  and that way let them kill as many as possible although I don t want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances   Vice President Henry Wallace   though popular among Democratic voters  was viewed as too far to the left and too friendly to labor for some of Roosevelt s advisers  Knowing that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term  both the President and several of his confidantes wanted to replace Wallace  Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman Frank C  Walker   incoming chairman Hannegan  party treasurer Edwin W  Pauley   strategist Ed Flynn   Chicago Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly and lobbyist George E  Allen all wanted to keep Wallace off the ticket    Roosevelt told party leaders he would accept either Truman or Supreme Court Justice William O  Douglas   State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman  and Roosevelt agreed  Truman did not campaign for the Vice Presidential spot  though he welcomed the attention as evidence that he had become more than the  Senator from Pendergast      Truman s nomination  dubbed the  Second Missouri Compromise    was well received  The RooseveltTruman ticket achieved a 43299 electoral vote victory in the election  defeating the Republican ticket of Governor Thomas E  Dewey of New York and running mate Governor John Bricker of Ohio  Truman was sworn in as vice president on January 20  1945     Truman s brief vice presidency was relatively uneventful  He cast his tie breaking vote as President of the Senate to confirm former Vice President Henry Wallace as Secretary of Commerce    Roosevelt rarely contacted him  even to inform him of major decisions  the President and Vice President met alone together only twice during their time in office    In one of his first acts as vice president  Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast s funeral  He brushed the criticism aside  saying simply   He was always my friend and I have always been his     He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt  he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top secret Manhattan Project   which was about to test the world s first atomic bomb     Truman had been vice president for 82 days when President Roosevelt died on April 12  1945    That afternoon  Truman presided over the Senate as usual  He had just adjourned the session for the day and was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn  s office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House  Truman assumed that President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him  but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him that her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage   Truman s first concern was for Mrs  Roosevelt  He asked if there was anything he could do for her  to which she replied   Is there anything we can do for you  You are the one in trouble now        Shortly after taking the oath of office  Truman said to reporters   Boys  if you ever pray  pray for me now  I don t know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you  but when they told me what happened yesterday  I felt like the moon  the stars  and all the planets had fallen on me       Upon assuming the presidency  Truman asked all the members of FDR s cabinet to remain in place  and told them that he was open to their advice  He emphasized a central principle of his administration  he would be the one making decisions  and they were to support him    Although Truman was told briefly on the afternoon of April 12 that the Allies had a new  highly destructive weapon  it was not until April 25 that Secretary of War Henry Stimson told him the details  Truman benefited from a honeymoon period after Roosevelt s death  and from the Allies  success in Europe  wrapping up the war there  Truman was pleased to issue the proclamation of V E Day on May 8  1945  his 61st birthday       We have discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world  It may be the fire destruction prophesied in the Euphrates Valley Era  after Noah and his fabulous Ark   In the wake of Allied victory  Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference   He was there when he learned that the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful  He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the U S  was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese  Though this was the first time the Soviets had been officially given information about the atomic bomb  Stalin was already aware of the bomb project  having learned about it  through espionage   long before Truman did         In August  the Japanese government refused surrender demands as specifically outlined in the Potsdam Declaration and with the invasion of mainland Japan imminent  Truman approved the schedule for dropping the two available bombs  Truman always said that attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides  military estimates for the invasion of mainland Japan were that it could take a year and result in 250 000 to 500 000 American casualties  Hiroshima was bombed on August 6  and Nagasaki three days later  Japan agreed to surrender the following day       Supporters   b   of Truman s decision argue that  given the tenacious Japanese defense of the outlying islands  the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of lives that would have been lost invading mainland Japan  Critics have argued that the use of nuclear weapons was inherently immoral    Truman strongly defended himself in his memoirs in 195556  stating that many lives could have been lost had the U S  invaded mainland Japan  In 1963 he stood by his decision  telling a journalist  it was done to save 125 000 youngsters on the American side and 125 000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is what it did  It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life      The end of World War II was followed by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy  The costs of the war effort were enormous  and Truman was intent on decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible  Demobilizing the military and reducing the size of the various services was a cost saving priority  The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown  but fears existed that the nation would slide back into a depression  A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans  Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U S  should steer  In addition  Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years  and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc     The president was faced with the reawakening of labor management conflicts that had lain dormant during the war years  severe shortages in housing and consumer products  and widespread dissatisfaction with inflation  which at one point hit 6  in a single month    Added to this polarized environment was a wave of destabilizing strikes in major industries  Truman s response to them was generally seen as ineffective    A rapid increase in costs was fueled by the release of price controls on most items  and labor sought wage increases  A serious steel strike in January 1946 involving 800 000 workersthe largest in the nation s historywas followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May  The public was angry  with a majority in polls favoring a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year s moratorium on labor actions  Truman proposed legislation to draft striking workers into the Armed Forces  and in a dramatic personal appearance before Congress  was able to announce settlement of the rail strike  His proposal passed the House of Representatives  but failed in the Senate      For commodities where price controls remained  producers were often unwilling to sell at artificially low prices  farmers refused to sell grain for months in 1945 and 1946 until payments were significantly increased  even though grain was desperately needed  not only for domestic use  but to stave off starvation in Europe     Although labor strife was muted after the settlement of the railway strike  it continued through Truman s presidency  The President s approval rating dropped from 82  in the polls in January 1946 to 52  by June    This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration s policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections  when Republicans took control of Congress for the first time since 1930  The 80th Congress included Republican freshmen who would become prominent in the years to come  including Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy and California Congressman Richard Nixon   When Truman dropped to 32  in the polls  Democratic Arkansas Senator William Fulbright suggested that Truman resign  the President said that he did not care what Senator  Halfbright  said       Truman cooperated closely with the Republican leaders on foreign policy  though he fought them bitterly on domestic issues  The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the TaftHartley Act   which was enacted over Truman s veto   Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947  Although the initial vetoes were sustained  Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948  The parties did cooperate on some issues  Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947   making the Speaker of the House rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the vice president     As he readied for the 1948 election  Truman made clear his identity as a Democrat in the New Deal tradition  advocating national health insurance     the repeal of the TaftHartley Act  He broke with the New Deal by initiating an aggressive civil rights program  which he termed a moral priority  Taken together  it constituted a broad legislative agenda that came to be called the   Fair Deal      Truman s proposals were not well received by Congress  even with renewed Democratic majorities in Congress after 1948  The Solid South rejected civil rights  as those states still enforced segregation  Only one of the major Fair Deal bills  the Housing Act of 1949   was ever enacted      On the other hand  the major New Deal programs still in operation were not repealed  and there were minor improvements and extensions in many of them     As a Wilsonian internationalist  Truman strongly supported creation of the United Nations  and included Eleanor Roosevelt on the delegation to the UN s first General Assembly     With the Soviet Union expanding its sphere of influence through Eastern Europe  Truman and his foreign policy advisors took a hard line against the USSR  In this  he matched American public opinion  which quickly came to view the Soviets as intent upon world domination     Although he claimed no personal expertise on foreign matters  Truman won bipartisan support for both the Truman Doctrine   which formalized a policy of Soviet containment   and the Marshall Plan   which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe      To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy  Truman used an ideological argument  arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas    As part of the U S  Cold War strategy  Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment  later the Department of Defense   and creating the U S  Air Force   The act also created the CIA and the National Security Council     In 1952  Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating the National Security Agency  NSA    On June 23  1948  the Soviet Union blocked access to the three Western held sectors of Berlin  The Allies had never negotiated a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet occupied zone  The commander of the American occupation zone in Germany  General Lucius D  Clay   proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to West Berlin with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked  Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war  He approved Ernest Bevin s plan to supply the blockaded city by air  On June 25  the Allies initiated the Berlin Airlift   a campaign that delivered food and other supplies  such as coal  using military aircraft on a massive scale  Nothing like it had ever been attempted before  and no single nation had the capability  either logistically or materially  to have accomplished it  The airlift worked  ground access was again granted on May 11  1949  Nevertheless  the airlift continued for several months after that  The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman s great foreign policy successes  it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948     Truman had long taken an interest in the history of the Middle East  and had read many books on ancient history and the events related in the Bible  He was sympathetic to those who sought a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine   As a senator  he had assured Jewish leaders of his support for Zionism   and at a 1943 rally in Chicago had called for a homeland for those Jews who survived the Nazi regime  A Jewish homeland in Palestine was widely popular in the United States  and Jewish support appeared to be important in the upcoming presidential election  However  State Department officials were reluctant to offend the Arabs  who were opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state in the large region long populated and dominated culturally by Arabs  Secretary of Defense James Forrestal warned Truman of the importance of Saudi Arabian oil in another war  Truman replied that he would decide his policy on the basis of justice  not oil    When diplomats were called home from the Middle East to advise Truman and express their concerns about trying to set up a Jewish state in the midst of the Arab majority region  Truman told them he had few Arabs among his constituents     American policy makers in 194748 agreed that the highest foreign policy objective was containment of Soviet expansion as the Cold War unfolded  From the perspective of many officials  Palestine was secondary to the goal of protecting the  Northern Tier  of Greece  Turkey  and Iran from Communism  as promised by the Truman Doctrine    Weary of both the convoluted politics of the Middle East and pressures by Jewish leaders  Truman was undecided on his policy  He later cited as decisive in his recognition of the Jewish state the advice of his former business partner  Eddie Jacobson  a non religious Jew whom Truman absolutely trusted    Truman decided to recognize Israel over the objections of Secretary of State George Marshall   who feared it would hurt relations with the populous Arab states  Marshall believed the paramount threat to the U S  was the Soviet Union and feared that Arab oil would be lost to the United States in the event of war  he warned Truman that U S  was  playing with fire with nothing to put it out     Truman recognized the State of Israel on May 14  1948  eleven minutes after it declared itself a nation        Truman later wrote   Hitler had been murdering Jews right and left  I saw it  and I dream about it even to this day  The Jews needed some place where they could go  It is my attitude that the American government couldn t stand idly by while the victims  of  Hitler s madness are not allowed to build new lives     The 1948 presidential election is remembered for Truman s stunning come from behind victory    In the spring of 1948  Truman s public approval rating stood at 36     and the president was nearly universally regarded as incapable of winning the general election  The  New Deal  operatives within the partyincluding FDR s son James tried to swing the Democratic nomination to General Dwight D  Eisenhower   a highly popular figure whose political views and party affiliation were totally unknown  Eisenhower emphatically refused to accept  and Truman outflanked opponents to his nomination     At the 1948 Democratic National Convention   Truman attempted to unify the party with a vague civil rights plank in the party platform  His intention was to assuage the internal conflicts between the northern and southern wings of his party  Events overtook his efforts  A sharp address given by Mayor Hubert Humphrey of Minneapolis as well as the local political interests of a number of urban bossesconvinced the Convention to adopt a stronger civil rights plank  which Truman approved wholeheartedly  All of Alabama s delegates  and a portion of Mississippi s  walked out of the convention in protest    Unfazed  Truman delivered an aggressive acceptance speech attacking the 80th Congress  which Truman called the  Do Nothing Congress     and promising to win the election and  make these Republicans like it      Within two weeks of the convention  in 1948 Truman issued Executive Order 9981   racially integrating the U S  Armed Services       and Executive Order 9980 to integrate federal agencies  Truman took a considerable political risk in backing civil rights  and many seasoned Democrats were concerned that the loss of Dixiecrat support might destroy the Democratic Party  South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond   a segregationist  declared his candidacy for the presidency on a Dixiecrat ticket and led a full scale revolt of Southern   states  rights   proponents  This rebellion on the right was matched by one on the left  led by Wallace on the Progressive Party ticket  Immediately after its first post FDR convention  the Democratic Party seemed to be disintegrating  Victory in November seemed unlikely as the party was not simply split but divided three ways    For his running mate  Truman accepted Kentucky Senator Alben W  Barkley   though he really wanted Justice William O  Douglas   who turned down the nomination     The campaign was a 21 928 mile  35 290km  presidential odyssey    In a personal appeal to the nation  Truman crisscrossed the U S  by train  his   whistle stop   speeches from the rear platform of the observation car   Ferdinand Magellan   came to represent his campaign  His combative appearances  such as those at the town square of Harrisburg   Illinois  captured the popular imagination and drew huge crowds  Six stops in Michigan drew a combined half million people    a full million turned out for a New York City ticker tape parade     The large  mostly spontaneous gatherings at Truman s whistle stop events were an important sign of a change in momentum in the campaign  but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national press corps  It continued reporting Republican Thomas Dewey  s apparent impending victory as a certainty  One reason for the press  inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone  but many people  including much of Truman s populist base  did not yet own a telephone    This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed  An unintended and undetected projection error may have contributed to the perception of Truman s bleak chances  The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date Roper in September  and Crossley and Gallup in Octoberthus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey       In the end  Truman held his progressive Midwestern base  won most of the Southern states despite the civil rights plank  and squeaked through with narrow victories in a few critical states  notably Ohio  California  and Illinois  The final tally showed that the president had secured 303 electoral votes  Dewey 189  and Thurmond only 39  Henry Wallace got none  The defining image of the campaign came after Election Day  when an ecstatic Truman held aloft the erroneous front page of the Chicago Tribune with a huge headline proclaiming   Dewey Defeats Truman       Truman s inauguration was the first ever televised nationally    His second term was grueling  primarily because of foreign policy challenges connected directly or indirectly to his policy of containment   He quickly had to come to terms with the end of the American nuclear monopoly  using information gained by its espionage networks in the U S   the Soviet Union s atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected  and they detonated their first bomb on August 29  1949  In response  on January 7  1953  Truman announced the detonation of the first U S  hydrogen bomb      On June 25  1950  Kim Il sung  s North Korean People s Army invaded South Korea  starting the Korean War   In the early weeks of the war  the North Koreans easily pushed back their southern counterparts    Truman called for a naval blockade of Korea  only to learn that due to budget cutbacks  the U S  Navy could not enforce such a measure    Truman promptly urged the United Nations to intervene  it did  authorizing troops under the UN flag led by U S  General Douglas MacArthur    Truman decided that he did not need formal authorization from Congress  believing that most legislators supported his position  this would come back to haunt him later  when the stalemated conflict was dubbed  Mr  Truman s War  by legislators    However  on July 3  1950  Truman did give Senate Majority Leader Scott W  Lucas a draft resolution titled  Joint Resolution Expressing Approval of the Action Taken in Korea   Lucas said Congress supported the use of force  that the formal resolution would pass but was unnecessary  and that the consensus in Congress was to acquiesce  Truman responded that he did not want  to appear to be trying to get around Congress and use extra Constitutional powers   and added that it was  up to Congress whether such a resolution should be introduced       unreliable source     By August 1950  U S  troops pouring into South Korea under UN auspices were able to stabilize the situation    Responding to criticism over readiness  Truman fired his Secretary of Defense  Louis A  Johnson   replacing him with the retired General Marshall  With UN approval  Truman decided on a  rollback  policyconquest of North Korea    UN forces led by General Douglas MacArthur led the counterattack  scoring a stunning surprise victory with an amphibious landing at the Battle of Inchon that nearly trapped the invaders  UN forces marched north  toward the Yalu River boundary with China  with the goal of reuniting Korea under UN auspices     However  China surprised the UN forces with a large scale invasion in November  The UN forces were forced back to below the 38th parallel   then recovered    By early 1951 the war became a fierce stalemate at about the 38th parallel where it had begun  Truman rejected MacArthur s request to attack Chinese supply bases north of the Yalu  but MacArthur promoted his plan to Republican House leader Joseph Martin   who leaked it to the press  Truman was gravely concerned that further escalation of the war might lead to open conflict with the Soviet Union  which was already supplying weapons and providing warplanes  with Korean markings and Soviet aircrew   Therefore  on April 11  1951  Truman fired MacArthur from his commands     I fired him  MacArthur  because he wouldn t respect the authority of the President    I didn t fire him because he was a dumb son of a bitch  although he was  but that s not against the law for generals  If it was  half to three quarters of them would be in jail     The dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur was among the least politically popular decisions in presidential history  Truman s approval ratings plummeted  and he faced calls for his impeachment from  among others  Senator Robert A  Taft     Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead  Others  including Eleanor Roosevelt  supported and applauded Truman s decision  MacArthur meanwhile returned to the U S  to a hero s welcome  and addressed a joint session of Congress  a speech which the President called  a bunch of damn bullshit      The war remained a frustrating stalemate for two years  with over 30 000 Americans killed  until an armistice ended the fighting in 1953    In February 1952  Truman s approval mark stood at 22  according to Gallup polls   which was  until George W  Bush in 2008  the all time lowest approval mark for an active American president     The escalation of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman s approval of NSC 68   a secret statement of foreign policy  It called for tripling the defense budget  and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the U S  and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion  The document was drafted by Paul Nitze   who consulted State and Defense officials  it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea  It called for partial mobilization of the U S  economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets  The plan called for strengthening Europe  weakening the Soviet Union  and for building up the U S  both militarily and economically     Early in Truman s second term  his former Secretary of Defense Forrestal died soon after his retirement  Forrestal had become exhausted through years of hard labor during and after the war  and began to suffer depression   He retired in March 1949  soon after  he was hospitalized but he committed suicide in May     Truman was a strong supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization   NATO    which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II  The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949  Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander  NATO s goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world s democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals  The U S   Britain  France  Italy  the Netherlands  Belgium  Luxembourg  Norway  Denmark  Portugal  Iceland  and Canada were the original treaty signatories  The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance  called the Warsaw Pact        General Marshall was Truman s principal adviser on foreign policy matters  influencing such decisions as the U S  choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai shek and his Nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War with their communist opponents  Marshall s opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman s other advisershe thought that even propping up Chiang s forces would drain U S  resources in Europe needed to deter the Soviets    When the communists took control of the mainland  driving the Nationalists to Taiwan and establishing the People s Republic of China   Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the U S  and the new government  but Mao was unwilling    On June 27  1950  after the outbreak of fighting in Korea  Truman ordered the U S  Navy s Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China  ROC  on Taiwan       In August 1948  Whittaker Chambers   a former spy for the Soviets and a senior editor at Time magazine  testified before the House Un American Activities Committee  HUAC   He said that an underground communist network had been working within the U S  government since the 1930s  of which Chambers had been a member  along with Alger Hiss   until recently a senior State Department official  Although Hiss denied the allegations  he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for his denials under oath  The Soviet Union s success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude that subversion by Soviet spies was responsible  and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence      However  Truman did not fully share such opinions  He famously called the Hiss trial a  red herring   and the Justice Department was moving to indict Chambers instead of Hiss for perjury     Following Hiss  conviction  Secretary of State Dean Acheson announced that he stood by him  This and other events  such as the revelation that British atomic bomb scientist Klaus Fuchs was a spy  led current and former members of HUAC  including Congressman Nixon of California and Karl Mundt of South Dakota  to decry Truman and his administration  especially the State Department  as soft on communism  Wisconsin Senator McCarthy used a Lincoln Day speech in Wheeling  West Virginia to accuse the State Department of harboring communists  and rode the controversy to political fame    In the following years  Republicans used Hiss  conviction to castigate the Democrats for harboring communists in government  Congressman Nixon gained election to the Senate in 1950 on an anti communist platform  defeating the liberal Helen Gahagan Douglas   whom he called  the Pink Lady      Charges that Soviet agents had infiltrated the government were believed by 78  of the people in 1946  and became a major campaign issue for Eisenhower in 1952    Truman was reluctant to take a more radical stance because he feared that the full disclosure of the extent of the communist infiltration would reflect badly on the Democratic Party  It was a time of the Red Scare   In a 1956 interview  Truman denied that Alger Hiss had ever been a communist  a full six years after Hiss  conviction for perjury on this topic    In 1949 Truman described American communist leaders  whom his administration was prosecuting   as  traitors   but in 1950 he vetoed the McCarran Internal Security Act   It was passed over his veto    Truman would later state in private conversations with friends that his creation of a loyalty program had been a  terrible  mistake     In 1948  Truman ordered an addition to the exterior of the White House   a second floor balcony in the south portico  which came to be known as the   Truman Balcony    The addition was unpopular  some said it spoiled the appearance of the south facade  but it gave the First Family more living space        The work uncovered structural faults which led engineering experts to conclude that the building  much of it over 130 years old  was in a dangerously dilapidated condition  That August  a section of floor collapsed  and Truman s bedroom and bathroom were closed as unsafe  No public announcement about the serious structural problems of the White House was made until after the 1948 election had been won  By then Truman had been informed that his new balcony was the only part of the building that was sound   The Truman family moved into nearby Blair House during the renovations  As the newer West Wing   including the Oval Office   remained open  Truman walked to and from his work across the street each morning and afternoon  In due course  the decision was made to demolish and rebuild the whole interior of the main White House  as well as excavate new basement levels and underpin the foundations  The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside  The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952     On November 1  1950  Puerto Rican nationalists Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo attempted to assassinate Truman at Blair House  The attack drew new attention to security concerns surrounding Truman s residence at Blair House  He had jumped up from a nap  and was watching the gunfight from his open bedroom window until Secret Service agents shouted at him to take cover  On the street outside the residence  Torresola mortally wounded a White House policeman  Leslie Coffelt   Before he died  the officer shot and killed Torresola  Collazo was wounded  stopped before he entered the house  He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in 1952  Truman commuted his sentence to life in prison  To try to settle the question of Puerto Rican independence  Truman allowed a plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952 to determine the status of its relationship to the U S  Nearly 82  of the people voted in favor of a new constitution for the Estado Libre Associado  a continued  associated free state      In response to a labor management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and price controls  Truman instructed his Secretary of Commerce   Charles W  Sawyer   to take control of a number of the nation s steel mills in April 1952  Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions to be used in the war in Korea  The Supreme Court found Truman s actions unconstitutional  however  and reversed the order in a major separation of powers decision  Youngstown Sheet   Tube Co  v  Sawyer  1952   The 63 decision  which held that Truman s assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress  was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt  The high court s reversal of Truman s order was one of the notable defeats of his presidency     In 1950  the Senate  led by Estes Kefauver   investigated numerous charges of corruption among senior administration officials  some of whom received fur coats and deep freezers in exchange for favors  A large number of employees of the Internal Revenue Bureau  today the IRS  were accepting bribes  166 employees either resigned or were fired in 1950    with many soon facing indictment  When Attorney General J  Howard McGrath fired the special prosecutor in early 1952 for being too zealous  Truman fired McGrath    Truman submitted a reorganization plan to reform the IRB  Congress passed it  but the corruption was a major issue in the 1952 presidential election       On December 6  1950  music critic Paul Hume wrote a critical review of a concert by the president s daughter Margaret Truman   Miss Truman is a unique American phenomenon with a pleasant voice of little size and fair quality     she  cannot sing very well    is flat a good deal of the timemore last night than at any time we have heard her in past years    has not improved in the years we have heard her     and  still cannot sing with anything approaching professional finish     Harry Truman wrote a scathing response   I ve just read your lousy review of Margaret s concert  I ve come to the conclusion that you are an  eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay   It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful  When you write such poppy cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you re off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work  Some day I hope to meet you  When that happens you ll need a new nose  a lot of beefsteak for black eyes  and perhaps a supporter below  Pegler   a gutter snipe  is a gentleman alongside you  I hope you ll accept that statement as a worse insult than a reflection on your ancestry     Truman was criticized by many for the letter  However  he pointed out that he wrote it as a loving father and not as the president         In 1951  William M  Boyle   Truman s long time friend and chairman of the Democratic National Committee  was forced to resign after being charged with financial corruption   A 1947 report by the Truman administration titled To Secure These Rights presented a detailed ten point agenda of civil rights reforms  In February 1948  the president submitted a civil rights agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as voting rights and fair employment practices    This provoked a storm of criticism from Southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention  but Truman refused to compromise  saying   My forebears were Confederates    but my very stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers  just back from overseas  were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten     Tales of the abuse  violence  and persecution suffered by many African American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman  and were a major factor in his decision to issue Executive Order 9981   in July 1948  desegregating and requiring equal opportunity in the Armed Forces    After several years of planning  recommendations and revisions between Truman  the Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity and the various branches of the military  Army units became racially integrated     Another executive order  also in 1948  made it illegal to discriminate against persons applying for civil service positions based on race  A third  in 1951  established the Committee on Government Contract Compliance  CGCC   This committee ensured that defense contractors did not discriminate because of race       All of the cabinet members when Truman became president in 1945 had been appointed by Franklin D  Roosevelt   Truman appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court    Truman s judicial appointments have been called by critics  inexcusable     A former Truman aide confided that it was the weakest aspect of Truman s presidency    The New York Times condemned the appointments of Tom C  Clark and Sherman Minton in particular as examples of cronyism and favoritism for unqualified candidates     The four justices appointed by Truman joined with Justices Felix Frankfurter   Robert H  Jackson   and Stanley Reed to create a substantial seven member conservative bloc on the Supreme Court    This returned the court for a time to the conservatism of the 1920s     In addition to his four Supreme Court appointments  Truman appointed 27 judges to the courts of appeals   and 101 judges to federal district courts      In 1951  the U S  ratified the 22nd Amendment   making a president ineligible for election to a third term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two remaining years of a term of a previously elected president  The latter clause would have applied to Truman s situation in 1952 except that a grandfather clause in the amendment explicitly excluded the amendment from applying to the incumbent president     At the time of the 1952 New Hampshire primary  no candidate had won Truman s backing  His first choice  Chief Justice Fred M  Vinson   had declined to run  Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson had also turned Truman down  Vice President Barkley was considered too old      and Truman distrusted and disliked Senator Kefauver  who had made a name for himself by his investigations of the Truman administration scandals  Truman had hoped to recruit General Eisenhower as a Democratic candidate  but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination  Accordingly  Truman let his name be entered in the New Hampshire primary by supporters  The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver  18 days later the president announced he would not seek a second full term  Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run  and the governor gained the nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention      Eisenhower gained the Republican nomination  with Senator Nixon as his running mate  and campaigned against what he denounced as Truman s failures   Korea  Communism and Corruption   He pledged to clean up the  mess in Washington   and promised to  go to Korea       Eisenhower defeated Stevenson decisively in the general election   ending 20 years of Democratic presidents  While Truman and Eisenhower had previously been good friends  Truman felt betrayed that Eisenhower did not denounce Joseph McCarthy during the campaign    Similarly  Eisenhower was outraged when Truman  who made a whistlestop tour in support of Stevenson  accused the former general of disregarding  sinister forces    Anti Semitism  anti Catholicism  and anti foreignism  within the Republican Party    Eisenhower was so outraged he threatened not to make the customary ride down Pennsylvania Avenue with the departing president before the inauguration  but to meet Truman at the steps to the Capitol  where the swearing in takes place     Upon leaving the presidency  Truman returned to Independence  Missouri  to live at the Wallace home he and Bess had shared for years with her mother    Once out of office  Truman quickly decided that he did not wish to be on any corporate payroll  believing that taking advantage of such financial opportunities would diminish the integrity of the nation s highest office  He also turned down numerous offers for commercial endorsements  Since his earlier business ventures had proved unsuccessful  he had no personal savings  As a result  he faced financial challenges  Once Truman left the White House  his only income was his old army pension   112 56 per month    Former members of Congress and the federal courts received a federal retirement package  President Truman himself ensured that former servants of the executive branch of government received similar support  In 1953  however  there was no such benefit package for former presidents    and he received no pension for his Senate service     Truman took out a personal loan from a Missouri bank shortly after leaving office  and then set about establishing another precedent for future former chief executives  a book deal for his memoirs of his time in office  Ulysses S  Grant had overcome similar financial issues with his own memoirs  but the book had been published posthumously  and he had declined to write about life in the White House in any detail  For the memoirs  Truman received only a flat payment of  670 000  and had to pay two thirds of that in tax  he calculated he got  37 000 after he paid his assistants    However  the memoirs were a commercial and critical success      they were published in two volumes in 1955 and 1956 by Doubleday  Garden City  N Y  and Hodder   Stoughton  London   Memoirs by Harry S  Truman  Year of Decisions and Memoirs by Harry S  Truman  Years of Trial and Hope        The former president was quoted in 1957 as saying to then House Majority Leader John McCormack    Had it not been for the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother  sister  and I inherited from our mother  I would practically be on relief  but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed     The following year  Congress passed the Former Presidents Act   offering a  25 000 yearly pension to each former president  and it is likely that Truman s financial status played a role in the law s enactment    The one other living former president at the time  Herbert Hoover   also took the pension  even though he did not need the money  reportedly  he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman     Truman s predecessor  Franklin D  Roosevelt  had organized his own presidential library   but legislation to enable future presidents to do something similar had not been enacted  Truman worked to garner private donations to build a presidential library  which he donated to the federal government to maintain and operatea practice adopted by his successors    He testified before Congress to have money appropriated to have presidential papers copied and organized  and was proud of the bill s passage in 1957  Max Skidmore  in his book on the life of former presidents  noted that Truman was a well read man  especially in history  Skidmore added that the presidential papers legislation and the founding of his library  was the culmination of his interest in history  Together they constitute an enormous contribution to the United Statesone of the greatest of any former president      Truman supported Adlai Stevenson s second bid for the White House in 1956  although he had initially favored Democratic Governor W  Averell Harriman of New York    He continued to campaign for Democratic senatorial candidates for many years    Upon turning 80 in 1964  Truman was feted in Washington  and addressed the Senate  availing himself of a new rule that allowed former presidents to be granted privilege of the floor     After a fall in his home in late 1964  his physical condition declined  In 1965  President Lyndon B  Johnson signed the Medicare bill at the Harry S  Truman Presidential Library and Museum and gave the first two Medicare cards to Truman and his wife Bess to honor the former president s fight for government health care while in office     On December 5  1972  Truman was admitted to Kansas City s Research Hospital and Medical Center with lung congestion from pneumonia   He developed multiple organ failure and died at 7 50am on December 26 at the age of 88    Bess Truman opted for a simple private service at the library for her husband rather than a state funeral in Washington  A week after the funeral  foreign dignitaries and Washington officials attended a memorial service at Washington National Cathedral   Bess died in 1982  they both are buried at the Harry S  Truman Library   Museum in Independence       Citing continuing divisions within the Democratic Party  the ongoing Cold War  and the boom and bust cycle  an American Political Science Association prize winning 1952 book stated that  after seven years of Truman s hectic  even furious  activity the nation seemed to be about on the same general spot as when he first came to office Nowhere in the whole Truman record can one point to a single  decisive break through All his skills and energiesand he was among our hardest working Presidentswere directed to standing still     When he left office in 1953  Truman was one of the most unpopular chief executives in history  His job approval rating of 22  in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon s 24  in August 1974  the month that Nixon resigned   American public feeling towards Truman grew steadily warmer with the passing years  as early as 1962  a poll of 75 historians conducted by Arthur M  Schlesinger  Sr  ranked Truman among the  near great  presidents  The period following his death consolidated a partial rehabilitation of his legacy among both historians and members of the public    Truman died when the nation was consumed with crises in Vietnam and Watergate   and his death brought a new wave of attention to his political career    In the early and mid 1970s  Truman captured the popular imagination much as he had in 1948  this time emerging as a kind of political folk hero  a president who was thought to exemplify an integrity and accountability many observers felt was lacking in the Nixon White House   This public reassessment of Truman was aided by the popularity of a book of reminiscences which Truman had told to journalist Merle Miller beginning in 1961  with the agreement that they would not be published until after Truman s death     Truman had his latter day critics as well  After a review of information available to Truman about the presence of espionage activities in the U S  government  Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan concluded that Truman was  almost willfully obtuse  concerning the danger of American communism    In 2010  historian Alonzo Hamby concluded that  Harry Truman remains a controversial president     However  since leaving office  Truman has fared well in polls ranking the presidents   He has never been listed lower than ninth  and was ranked fifth in a C SPAN poll in 2009     The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused Truman advocates to claim vindication for Truman s decisions in the postwar period  According to Truman biographer Robert Dallek   His contribution to victory in the cold war without a devastating nuclear conflict elevated him to the stature of a great or near great president     The 1992 publication of David McCullough  s favorable biography of Truman further cemented the view of Truman as a highly regarded Chief Executive    According to historian Daniel R  McCoy in his book on the Truman presidency   Harry Truman himself gave a strong and far from incorrect impression of being a tough  concerned and direct leader  He was occasionally vulgar  often partisan  and usually nationalistic On his own terms  Truman can be seen as having prevented the coming of a third world war and having preserved from Communist oppression much of what he called the free world  Yet clearly he largely failed to achieve his Wilsonian aim of securing perpetual peace  making the world safe for democracy  and advancing opportunities for individual development internationally     In 1956  Truman traveled to Europe with his wife  In England  he met with Churchill and received an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree from Oxford University  Across Britain he was hailed  London s Daily Telegraph characterized Truman as the  Living and kicking symbol of everything that everybody likes best about the United States     In 1959  he was given a 50 year award by the Masons   recognizing his longstanding involvement  he was initiated on February 9  1909 into the Belton Masonic Lodge in Missouri  In 1911  he helped establish the Grandview Lodge  and he served as its first Worshipful Master  In September 1940  during his Senate re election campaign  Truman was elected Grand Master of the Missouri Grand Lodge of Freemasonry  Truman said later that the Masonic election assured his victory in the general election  In 1945  he was made a 33 Sovereign Grand Inspector General and an Honorary Member of the supreme council at the Supreme Council A A S R  Southern Jurisdiction Headquarters in Washington D C      Truman was also a member of Sons of the American Revolution  SAR    and a card carrying member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans     Two of his relatives were Confederate soldiers       In 1975  the Truman Scholarship was created as a federal program to honor U S  college students who exemplified dedication to public service and leadership in public policy    In 2004  the President Harry S  Truman Fellowship in National Security Science and Engineering was created as a distinguished postdoctoral three year appointment at Sandia National Laboratories     In 2001  the University of Missouri established the Harry S  Truman School of Public Affairs to advance the study and practice of governance    The University of Missouri s Missouri Tigers athletic programs have an official mascot named Truman the Tiger   On July 1  1996  Northeast Missouri State University became Truman State University to mark its transformation from a teachers  college to a highly selective liberal arts university and to honor the only Missourian to become president  A member institution of the City Colleges of Chicago   Harry S Truman College in Chicago  Illinois   is named in his honor for his dedication to public colleges and universities  In 2000  the headquarters for the State Department   built in the 1930s but never officially named  was dedicated as the Harry S Truman Building      Despite Truman s attempt to curtail the naval carrier arm  which led to the 1949 Revolt of the Admirals     an aircraft carrier is named after him  The USS Harry S  Truman  CVN 75  was christened on September 7  1996    The 129th Field Artillery Regiment is designated  Truman s Own  in recognition of Truman s service as commander of its D Battery during World War I      In 1984  Truman was posthumously awarded the United States Congressional Gold Medal     In 1991  he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians   and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol   In 2006  Thomas Daniel  grandson of the Trumans  accepted a star on the Missouri Walk of Fame to honor his late grandfather  In 2007  John Truman  a nephew  accepted a star for Bess Truman  The Walk of

March 29  1790  January 18  1862  was the tenth President of the United States  18411845   He was elected vice president on the 1840 Whig ticket with William Henry Harrison   and became president after his running mate  s death in April 1841  Tyler was known as a supporter of states  rights   which endeared him to his fellow Virginians   yet his acts as president showed that he was willing to support nationalist policies as long as they did not infringe on the rights of the states  Still  the circumstances of his unexpected rise to the presidency and his possible threat to the ambitions of other potential presidential candidates left him estranged from both major parties in Washington  A firm believer in manifest destiny   President Tyler sought to strengthen and preserve the Union through territorial expansion   most notably the annexation of the independent Republic of Texas in his last days in office   Tyler  born to an aristocratic Virginia family   came to national prominence at a time of political upheaval  In the 1820s the nation s only political party  the Democratic Republicans   split into factions  Though initially a Democrat   his opposition to Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren led him to ally with the Whig Party  Tyler served as a Virginia state legislator   governor   U S  representative   and U S  senator before his election as vice president in the presidential election of 1840  He was put on the ticket to attract states  rights Southerners to what was then a Whig coalition to defeat Van Buren s re election bid   Harrison s death made Tyler the first vice president to succeed to the presidency without being elected to the office  To forestall constitutional uncertainty  Tyler immediately took the oath of office   moved into the White House   and assumed full presidential powers  a precedent that would govern future successions and eventually become codified in the Twenty fifth Amendment   A strict constructionist   Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional   and vetoed several of his party s bills  Believing that the president should set policy instead of deferring to Congress  he attempted to bypass the Whig establishment  most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay   Most of Tyler s Cabinet resigned soon into his term  and the Whigs  dubbing him His Accidency   expelled him from the party  Though Tyler was not the first President to veto bills  he was the first to see his veto overridden by Congress  Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy  he had several foreign policy achievements  including the WebsterAshburton Treaty with Britain and the Treaty of Wanghia with Qing China    President Tyler dedicated his last two years in office to the annexation of Texas   He initially sought election to a full term  but after losing the support of both Whigs and Democrats  he withdrew  In the last days of his term  Congress passed the resolution authorizing the Texas annexation  which was carried out by Tyler s successor  James K  Polk   When the American Civil War began in 1861  Tyler sided with the Confederate government  and won election to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death  Although some have praised Tyler s political resolve  his presidency is generally held in low esteem by historians   today he is considered an obscure president  with little presence in the American cultural memory       John Tyler was born on March 29  1790  Like his future running mate William Henry Harrison   he hailed from Charles City County  Virginia   both descended from aristocratic and politically entrenched families   The Tyler family traced its lineage to colonial Williamsburg in the seventeenth century  John Tyler  Sr    commonly known as Judge Tyler  was a friend and college roommate of Thomas Jefferson and served in the House of Delegates   the lower house of the Virginia General Assembly   alongside Benjamin Harrison V   father of William  The elder Tyler served four years as Speaker of the House of Delegates before becoming a state court judge  He subsequently served as governor and as a judge on the U S  District Court at Richmond   His wife  Mary Marot  Armistead   was the daughter of a prominent plantation owner  Robert Booth Armistead  She died of a stroke when her son John was seven years old     With his two brothers and five sisters  Tyler was raised on Greenway Plantation   a 1 200 acre  5km 2   estate with a six room mansion his father had built    a   The Tylers  forty slaves grew various crops  including wheat  corn and tobacco    Judge Tyler was willing to pay high wages for tutors who would challenge his children academically    Tyler was an unhealthy child  thin and prone to diarrhea  such afflictions would burden him throughout his life    At the age of twelve  he entered the preparatory branch of the elite College of William and Mary   continuing the Tyler family s tradition of attending the college  Tyler graduated from the school s collegiate branch in 1807  at age seventeen  Among the books that informed his economic views was Adam Smith  s The Wealth of Nations   and he acquired a lifelong love of Shakespeare   His political opinions were shaped by Bishop James Madison   the college s president and a cousin to the future president of the same name  the bishop served as a second father and mentor to Tyler     After graduation Tyler studied law with his father  who was a state judge at the time  and later with former United States Attorney General Edmund Randolph   Tyler was admitted to the bar at the age of 19  in violation of the rules  the judge who examined him neglected to ask his age  By this time his father was serving as Governor of Virginia  18081811   and the young Tyler started a practice in Richmond  the state capital    In 1813 he purchased Woodburn plantation   and he resided there until 1821     In 1811  at the age of 21  Tyler was elected by his fellow Charles City County residents to the House of Delegates  He served five successive one year terms  and sat on the Courts and Justice committee  The young politician s defining positions were on display by the end of his first term in 1816  a strong support of states  rights and opposition to a national bank  He joined fellow legislator Benjamin W  Leigh in pushing for the censure of U S  senators William Branch Giles and Richard Brent of Virginia  who had voted for the recharter of the First Bank of the United States against the legislature s instructions    b      The United States was then facing hostilities with Britain in the War of 1812   Tyler  like most Americans of his day  was anti British  and at the onset of the war he urged military action in a speech to the House of Delegates  After the British capture of Hampton  Virginia in the summer of 1813  Tyler eagerly organized a small militia company of county residents to defend Richmond  but no attack came  he dissolved the company two months later    That same year  his father died  and Tyler inherited thirteen slaves along with his father s plantation    In 1816  he resigned his legislative seat to serve on the Governor s Council of State   a group of eight advisers elected by the General Assembly     The death of U S  Representative John Clopton in the fall of 1816 left a vacancy in the 23rd district   Tyler sought the seat  as did his friend and political ally Andrew Stevenson   As the two men did not differ politically  the race was a popularity contest    Tyler s political connections and campaigning skills won him the election by a slim margin  He was sworn in on December 17  1816  to serve as a Democratic Republican     c   the major political party in the Era of Good Feelings   in the Fourteenth Congress      While the Democratic Republicans had supported states  rights  in the wake of the War of 1812  many members urged a stronger central government  A majority in Congress wanted to see the federal government help to fund internal improvements such as ports and roadways  Tyler held fast to his strict constructionist beliefs  rejecting such proposals on both constitutional and personal grounds  He believed each state should construct necessary projects within its borders using locally generated funds  Virginia was not  in so poor a condition as to require a charitable donation from Congress   he contended    He was chosen to participate in an audit of the Second Bank of the United States in 1818 as part of a five man committee  and was appalled by corruption he perceived within the bank  He argued for the revocation of the bank charter  although Congress rejected any such proposal  His first clash with General Andrew Jackson followed Jackson s 1818 invasion of Florida during the First Seminole War   While praising Jackson s character  Tyler condemned him as overzealous  and for the execution of two British subjects   Tyler was elected for a full term without opposition in early 1819     Tyler was a slaveholder for his entire life  at one point keeping forty slaves at Greenway    Although he regarded slavery as an evil  and did not attempt to justify it  he never freed any of his slaves  Tyler considered slavery a matter for each state  and felt the federal government lacked the authority to abolish it  The living conditions of his slaves are not well documented  but historians agree that he cared for their well being and abstained from physical violence against them     The major issue of the Sixteenth Congress  181921  was whether Missouri should be admitted to the Union  and whether slavery would be permitted in the new state    Acknowledging the ills of slavery  he hoped that by letting it expand  there would be fewer slaves in the east as slave and master journeyed west  making it feasible to consider abolishing the institution in Virginia  Thus  slavery would be abolished through the action of individual states as the practice became rare  as had been done in some Northern states    Believing that Congress did not have the power to regulate slavery and that admitting states based on whether they were slave or free was a recipe for sectional conflict    Tyler voted against the Missouri Compromise   which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free one  It also forbade slavery in states formed from the northern part of the territories   Despite Tyler s opposition  the Compromise passed  Throughout his time in Congress  he voted against bills which would restrict slavery in the territories     Tyler declined to seek renomination in late 1820  citing ill health  He privately acknowledged his dissatisfaction with the position  as his opposing votes were largely symbolic and did little to change the political culture in Washington  he also observed that funding his children s education would be difficult on a congressman s low salary  He left office on March 3  1821  endorsing his former opponent Stevenson for the seat  and returned to private law practice full time     Restless and bored after two years at home practicing law  Tyler sought election to the House of Delegates in 1823  Neither member from Charles City County was seeking re election  and Tyler was elected easily that April  finishing first among the three candidates seeking the two seats    Upon taking his seat in December  he found the chamber thrust into debate over the impending presidential election of 1824   The congressional nominating caucus   an early system for choosing presidential candidates  was still used despite its growing unpopularity  Tyler attempted to bring the lower house to endorse the caucus system and choose William H  Crawford as the Democratic Republican candidate  Despite the legislature s support of Crawford  opposition to the caucus system killed Tyler s proposal  Tyler s most enduring effort in this second legislative tenure was saving the College of William and Mary  which suffered from waning enrollment and risked closure  Rather than move it from rural Williamsburg to the populous capital of Richmond  as some suggested  Tyler proposed that a series of administrative and financial reforms be enacted  These were passed into law and were successful  by 1840 the school would see its highest ever enrollment     Tyler s political fortunes were growing  he was considered as a possible candidate in the legislative deliberation for the 1824 U S  Senate election    He was nominated in December 1825 for Governor of Virginia  a position which was then appointed by the legislature  Tyler was elected 13181 over John Floyd   The office of governor was powerless under the original Virginia Constitution  17761830   lacking even veto authority  Tyler enjoyed a prominent oratorical platform but could do little to influence the legislature  His most visible act as governor was delivering the funeral address for former president Jefferson  a Virginian  who had died on July 4  1826    d   Tyler was deeply devoted to Jefferson  and his eloquent eulogy was well received     Tyler s governorship was otherwise uneventful  He promoted states  rights and adamantly opposed any concentration of federal power  In order to thwart federal infrastructure proposals  he suggested Virginia actively expand its own road system  A proposal was made to expand the state s poorly funded public school system  but no significant action was taken    Tyler was re elected unanimously to a second one year term in December 1826     In January 1827  the General Assembly considered whether to elect U S  Senator John Randolph for a full six year term  Randolph was a contentious figure  although he shared the staunch states  rights views held by most of the Virginia legislature  he had a reputation for fiery rhetoric and erratic behavior on the Senate floor  which put his allies in an awkward position  Furthermore  he had made enemies by fiercely opposing President John Quincy Adams and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay   The nationalists of the Democratic Republican Party  who supported Adams and Clay  were a sizable minority in the Virginia legislature  They hoped to unseat Randolph by capturing the vote of states  rights supporters who were uncomfortable with the senator s reputation  They approached Tyler  and promised their endorsement if he sought the seat  Tyler repeatedly declined the offer  endorsing Randolph as the best candidate  but the political pressure continued to mount  Eventually he conceded that he would accept the seat if chosen  On the day of the vote  it was argued by one assemblyman that there was no political difference between the two candidatesTyler was simply a more agreeable character than Randolph  The incumbent s supporters  though  contended that Tyler s election would be a tacit endorsement of the Adams administration  The legislature selected Tyler in a vote of 115110  and he resigned his governorship on March 4  1827  as his Senate term began     By the time of Tyler s election to the Senate  campaigning for the 1828 presidential election was in progress  Adams  the incumbent President  was challenged by General Jackson  The Democratic Republicans had splintered into Adams  National Republicans and Jackson s Democrats   Tyler disliked Adams for seeking to increase the power of the federal government  he feared Jackson would do the same  Still  Tyler was increasingly drawn to Jackson  hoping that he would not seek to spend as much federal money on internal improvements as Adams  In considering Jackson he wrote   Turning to him I may at least indulge in hope  looking on Adams I must despair      The first session of the Twentieth Congress began in early December 1827    e   Tyler served alongside his Virginia colleague and close friend Littleton Waller Tazewell   who shared his strict constructionist views and uneasy support of Jackson  Throughout his Senate service  Tyler vigorously opposed all bills which provided for national infrastructure projects  feeling these were matters for individual states to decide  He and his Southern colleagues unsuccessfully opposed the protectionist Tariff of 1828   known to its detractors as the  Tariff of Abominations   Tyler suggested that the Tariff s only positive outcome would be a national political backlash  restoring a respect for states  rights    Tyler remained a strong supporter of states  rights  stating  they may strike the Federal Government out of existence by a word  demolish the Constitution and scatter its fragments to the winds      Jackson was elected  and Tyler soon came to disagree with him politically  The senator was frustrated by Jackson s newly emerging spoils system   describing it as an  electioneering weapon   He voted against many of the President s nominations when they appeared to be based on patronage or did not follow constitutional procedure  Opposing the nominations of a president of his own party was considered  an act of insurgency  against his party    Tyler was particularly offended by Jackson s use of the recess appointment power to name three treaty commissioners to meet with emissaries from the Ottoman Empire   Tyler introduced a bill chastising the president for this     Tyler attempted to remain on good terms with Jackson  only opposing him on principle rather than partisanship  He defended Jackson for vetoing the Maysville Road funding project   which Jackson considered unconstitutional    He voted to confirm several of the president s appointments  including Jackson s future running mate Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to Britain     The leading issue in the 1832 presidential election was the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States  which both Tyler and Jackson opposed  Congress voted to recharter the bank in July 1832  and Jackson vetoed the bill for a mixture of constitutional and practical reasons  Tyler voted to sustain the veto and endorsed the president in his successful bid for re election     Tyler s uneasy relationship with his party came to a head during the 22nd Congress   as the Nullification Crisis of 183233 began  South Carolina  threatening secession   passed the Ordinance of Nullification in November 1832  declaring the  Tariff of Abominations  null and void within its borders  This raised the constitutional question of whether states could nullify federal laws  President Jackson  who denied such a right  prepared to sign a Force Bill allowing the federal government to use military action to enforce the tariff  Tyler  who sympathized with South Carolina s reasons for nullification  rejected Jackson s use of military force against a state and gave a speech in February 1833 outlining his views  He supported Clay s Compromise Tariff   enacted that year  to gradually reduce the tariff over ten years  alleviating tensions between the states and the federal government     In voting against the Force Bill  Tyler knew he would permanently alienate the pro Jackson faction of the Virginia legislature  even those who had tolerated his irregularity up to this point  This would jeopardize his re election in February 1833   in which he faced the pro administration Democrat James McDowell   With Clay s endorsement  Tyler was re elected by a margin of 12 votes  several legislators who had supported him only weeks beforehand were moved to vote against him as a result of his position on the Force Bill     Jackson further offended Tyler by moving to dissolve the Bank by executive fiat  In September 1833  Jackson issued an executive order directing Treasury Secretary Roger B  Taney to transfer federal funds from the Bank to state chartered banks without delay  Tyler saw this as  a flagrant assumption of power   a breach of contract  and a threat to the economy  After months of agonizing  he decided to join with Jackson s opponents  Sitting on the Senate Finance Committee   he voted for two censure resolutions against the president in March 1834    By this time  Tyler had become affiliated with Clay s newly formed Whig Party   which held control of the Senate  On March 3  1835  with only hours remaining in the congressional session   the Whigs voted him President pro tempore of the Senate as a symbolic gesture of approval    He is the only U S  president to have held this office     Shortly thereafter  the Democrats took control of the Virginia House of Delegates  Tyler was offered a judgeship in exchange for resigning his seat  but he declined  Tyler understood what was to come  he would soon be forced by the legislature to cast a vote that went against his constitutional beliefs  Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri had introduced a bill expunging the censure of Jackson  By resolution of the Democratic controlled legislature  Tyler could be instructed to vote for the bill  If he disregarded the instructions  he would be violating his own principles   the first act of my political life was a censure on Messrs  Giles and Brent for opposition to instructions   he noted    Over the next few months he sought the counsel of his friends  who gave him conflicting advice  By mid February he felt that his Senate career was likely at an end  He issued a letter of resignation to the Vice President  Van Buren  on February 29  1836  saying in part     I shall carry with me into retirement the principles which I brought with me into public life  and by the surrender of the high station to which I was called by the voice of the people of Virginia  I shall set an example to my children which shall teach them to regard as nothing place and office  when either is to be attained or held at the sacrifice of honor   While Tyler wished to attend to his private life and family  he was soon swept up in the presidential election of 1836  He had been suggested as a vice presidential candidate since early 1835  and the same day the Virginia Democrats issued the expunging instruction  the Virginia Whigs nominated him as their candidate  The new Whig Party was not organized enough to hold a national convention and name a single ticket against Van Buren  Jackson s chosen successor  Instead  Whigs in various regions each put forth their own preferred ticket  reflecting the party s tenuous coalition  the Massachusetts Whigs nominated Daniel Webster and Francis Granger   the Anti Masons of the Northern and border states backed William Henry Harrison and Granger  and the states  rights advocates of the middle and lower South nominated Hugh Lawson White and John Tyler    In Maryland  the Whig ticket was Harrison and Tyler  The Whigs wanted to deny Van Buren a majority in the Electoral College  throwing the election into the House of Representatives  where deals could be made  Tyler hoped electors would be unable to elect a vice president  and that he would be one of the top two vote getters  from whom the Senate  under the Twelfth Amendment   must choose     Following the custom of the times that candidates not appear to seek the office  Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign  and did not make speeches    Tyler received only 47 electoral votes in the November 1836 election  trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate  Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky  Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president  but he lost to Van Buren    The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College  but for the only time in American history  the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate  which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot     Tyler had been drawn into Virginia politics even as a U S  Senator  From October 1829 to January 1830  he served as a member of the state constitutional convention   a role which he had been reluctant to accept  The original Virginia Constitution gave outsize influence to the state s more conservative eastern counties  as it allocated an equal number of legislators to each county  regardless of population  and only granted suffrage to property owners  The convention gave the more populous and liberal counties of western Virginia an opportunity to expand their influence  Tyler  a slaveowner from eastern Virginia  supported the existing system  He largely remained on the sidelines during the debate  however  not wishing to alienate any of the state s political factions  He was focused on his Senate career  which required a broad base of support  and gave speeches during the convention promoting compromise and unity     After the 1836 election  Tyler thought his political career was at an end  and planned to return to private law practice  In the fall of 1837 a friend sold him a sizable property in Williamsburg  Unable to remain away from politics  Tyler successfully sought election to the House of Delegates  He took his seat in 1838  Tyler was a national political figure by this point  and his third delegate service touched on such national issues as the sale of public lands     Tyler s successor in the Senate was William Cabell Rives   a conservative Democrat  In February 1839  the General Assembly considered who should fill the seat that was to expire the following month  Rives had drifted away from his party  signalling a possible alliance with the Whigs  As Tyler had already fully rejected the Democrats  he expected the Whigs would support him  Still  many Whigs found Rives a more politically expedient choice  as they hoped to ally with the conservative wing of the Democratic Party in the 1840 presidential election  This strategy was supported by Whig leader Henry Clay  who nevertheless admired Tyler at that time  With the vote split among three candidates  including Rives and Tyler  the Senate seat remained vacant for almost two years  until January 1841     By the time the 1839 Whig National Convention in Harrisburg  Pennsylvania   convened to choose the party s ticket for the following year s presidential election  the United States was in the third year of a serious recession  dubbed the Panic of 1837   President Van Buren s ineffective efforts to deal with the situation cost him public support  With the Democratic Party torn into factions  the head of the Whig ticket would likely be the next president  Harrison  Clay  and General Winfield Scott all sought the nomination  Tyler attended the convention and was with the Virginia delegation  although he had no official status  Because of bitterness over the unresolved Senate election  the Virginia delegation refused to make Tyler its favorite son candidate for vice president  Tyler himself did nothing to aid his chances  If his favored candidate for the presidential nomination  Clay  was successful  he would likely not be chosen for the second place on the ticket  which would probably go to a Northerner to assure geographic balance     The convention deadlocked among the three main candidates  with Virginia s votes going to Clay  Many Northern Whigs opposed Clay  and some  including Pennsylvania s Thaddeus Stevens   showed the Virginians a letter written by Scott in which he apparently displayed abolitionist sentiments  The influential Virginia delegation then announced that Harrison was its second choice  causing most Scott supporters to abandon him in favor of Harrison  who gained the nomination     The vice presidential nomination was considered of little moment  no president had failed to complete his elected term  Not much attention was given to the choice  and the specifics of how Tyler came to gain it are unclear  Chitwood pointed out that Tyler was a logical candidate  as a Southern slaveowner  he both balanced the ticket and assuaged the fears of Southerners who felt Harrison might have abolitionist leanings  Tyler had been a vice presidential candidate in 1836  and having him on the ticket might win Virginia  the most populous state in the South  One of the convention managers  New York publisher Thurlow Weed   alleged that  Tyler was finally taken because we could get nobody else to accept   but he did not say this until after the break between President Tyler and the Whig Party    Other Tyler foes claimed that he had wept himself into the White House  having been given the nomination after crying at Clay s defeat  although such emotion would be unlikely as the Kentuckian had not reciprocated Tyler s support  backing Rives in the Senate election    When Tyler s name was submitted in the balloting  Virginia abstained from voting  but he received the necessary majority  Tyler  as president  was accused of having gained the nomination by concealing his views  and responded that he had not been asked about them  His biographer  Robert Seager II  held that Tyler was selected because of a dearth of alternative candidates  Seager concluded   He was put on the ticket to draw the South to Harrison  No more  no less      What has caused this great commotion  motion  Our country through  It is the ball a rolling on  For Tippecanoe and Tyler too  Tippecanoe and Tyler too  And with them  we ll beat the little Van  Van  Van Van is a used up man   There was no Whig platform   leaders decided that trying to put one together would tear the party apart  Thus  the Whigs ran on their opposition to Van Buren  and blamed him and his Democrats for the recession    In campaign materials  Tyler was praised for integrity in resigning over the legislature s instructions    The Whigs initially hoped to muzzle Harrison and Tyler  lest they make policy statements that alienated parts of the party  But after Tyler s Democratic rival  Vice President Johnson  made a successful speaking tour  Tyler was called upon to travel from Williamsburg to Columbus  Ohio   and there address a local convention  a speech intended to assure Northerners that he shared Harrison s views  In his journey of nearly two months  Tyler made speeches at rallies  He could not avoid questions  and after being heckled into an admission that he supported the Compromise Tariff  many Whigs did not   resorted to quoting from Harrison s vague speeches  In his two hour speech at Columbus  Tyler entirely avoided the issue of the Bank of the United States  one of the major questions of the day     To win the election  Whig leaders decided they had to mobilize people across the country  including women  who could not then vote  This was the first time that an American political party included women in campaign activities on a widespread scale  and women in Tyler s Virginia were active on his behalf    The party hoped to avoid issues and win through public enthusiasm  with torchlight processions and alcohol fueled political rallies    The interest in the campaign was unprecedented  with many public events  When the Democratic press depicted Harrison as an old soldier  who would turn aside from his campaign if given a barrel of hard cider to drink in his log cabin   the Whigs eagerly seized on the image  and the log cabin campaign was born  The facts that Harrison lived on a palatial estate along the Ohio River and Tyler was well to do were not publicized  but log cabin images appeared everywhere  from banners to whiskey bottles  Cider was the favored beverage of many farmers and tradesmen  and Whigs claimed that Harrison preferred that drink of the common man    Democrats complained that the Harrison Tyler campaign s liberal provision of hard cider at rallies was encouraging drunkenness     The presidential candidate s military service was emphasized  thus the campaign jingle    Tippecanoe and Tyler Too    referring to Harrison s victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe   the slogan remains well known today  Glee clubs sprouted all over the country  singing patriotic and inspirational songs  one Democratic editor stated that he found the songfests in support of the Whig Party to be unforgettable  Among the lyrics sung were  We shall vote for Tyler therefore Without a why or wherefore     Louis Hatch  in his history of the vice presidency  noted   the Whigs roared  sang  and hard cidered the  hero of Tippecanoe  into the White House      Clay  though embittered by another of his many defeats for the presidency  was appeased by Tyler s withdrawal from the still unresolved Senate race  which would permit the election of Rives  and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison Tyler ticket    Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia  he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong    but was consoled by an overall victoryHarrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 23460 and with 53 percent of the popular vote  Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26  The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress     As Vice President elect   Tyler remained quietly at his home in Williamsburg  He privately expressed hopes that Harrison would prove decisive and not allow intrigue in the Cabinet  especially in the first days of the administration    Tyler did not participate in selecting the Cabinet  and did not recommend anyone for federal office in the new Whig administration  Harrison  beset by office seekers and the demands of Senator Clay  twice sent letters to Tyler asking his advice as to whether a Van Buren appointee should be dismissed  In both cases  Tyler recommended against  Harrison accordingly stated   Mr  Tyler says they ought not to be removed  and I will not remove them     The two men met briefly in Richmond in February  and reviewed a parade together    though they did not discuss politics     Tyler was sworn in on March 4  1841  in the Senate chamber  and delivered a three minute speech about states  rights before swearing in the new senators and attending President Harrison s inauguration   Following Harrison s two hour speech on that freezing March 4  the Vice President returned to the Senate to receive the President s Cabinet appointments  presiding over their confirmations the following daya total of two hours as President of the Senate  Expecting few responsibilities  he then left Washington   quietly returning to his home in Williamsburg    Seager later wrote   Had William Henry Harrison lived  John Tyler would undoubtedly have been as obscure as any vice president in American history      Harrison  meanwhile  struggled to keep up with the demands of Henry Clay and others who sought offices and influence in his administration  Harrison s old age and fading health were no secret during the campaign  and the question of the presidential succession was on every politician s mind  The first few weeks of the presidency took a toll on Harrison s health  and after being caught in a rainstorm in late March he came down with pneumonia and pleurisy     Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent word to Tyler of Harrison s illness on April 1  two days later  Richmond attorney James Lyons wrote with the news that the president had taken a turn for the worse  remarking that  I shall not be surprised to hear by tomorrow s mail that Gen l Harrison is no more     Tyler determined not to travel to Washington  not wanting to appear unseemly in anticipating the president s death  At dawn on April 5  Webster s son Fletcher   Chief Clerk of the State Department  arrived at Tyler s plantation with a letter from Webster  informing the new president of Harrison s death the morning before     Harrison s unprecedented death in office caused considerable uncertainty regarding presidential succession  The Constitution of the United States stated only that   In Case of the Removal of the President from Office  or of his Death  Resignation  or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office  the same shall devolve on the Vice President     This led to the question of whether the actual office of President  devolved  upon Vice President Tyler  or merely its powers and duties    The Cabinet met within an hour of Harrison s death and  according to a later account  determined that Tyler would be  Vice President acting President     However  by the time Tyler arrived in Washington at 4 00a m  on April 6  1841  he had firmly resolved that he was  in name and fact  the president of the United States  Acting on this determination  he had himself sworn in as president  without any qualifiers  in his hotel room  He considered the Presidential oath redundant to his oath as vice president  but wished to quell any doubt over his accession     Immediately after his inauguration  Tyler called the Cabinet into session  having decided to retain its members  Webster informed him of Harrison s practice of making policy by a majority vote  The Cabinet fully expected the new president to continue this practice  Tyler was astounded and immediately corrected them   I beg your pardon  gentlemen  I am very glad to have in my Cabinet such able statesmen as you have proved yourselves to be  And I shall be pleased to avail myself of your counsel and advice  But I can never consent to being dictated to as to what I shall or shall not do  I  as president  shall be responsible for my administration  I hope to have your hearty co operation in carrying out its measures  So long as you see fit to do this  I shall be glad to have you with me  When you think otherwise  your resignations will be accepted     He delivered a de facto inaugural address on April 9 reasserting his fundamental tenets of Jeffersonian democracy and limited federal power  Tyler s claim to be president was not immediately accepted by opposition members of Congress such as John Quincy Adams   who felt that Tyler should be a caretaker under the title of  Acting President    or remain vice president in name    Among those who questioned Tyler s authority was Clay  who had planned to be  the real power behind a fumbling throne  while Harrison was alive  and intended the same for Tyler    Clay saw Tyler as the  vice president  and his presidency as a mere   regency       Ratification of the decision by Congress came through the customary notification that it makes to the president  that it is in session and available to receive messages  In both houses  unsuccessful amendments were offered to strike the word  president  in favor of language including the term  vice president  to refer to Tyler  Mississippi Senator Robert J  Walker   in opposition  stated that the idea that Tyler was still vice president and could preside over the Senate was absurd     Tyler s opponents never fully accepted him as president  He was referred to by many mocking nicknames  including  His Accidency     However  Tyler never wavered from his conviction that he was the rightful president  when his political opponents sent correspondence to the White House addressed to the  vice president  or  acting president   Tyler had it returned unopened     Harrison had been expected to adhere closely to Whig Party policies and to defer to party congressional leaders  particularly Clay  When Tyler succeeded him  he at first was in accord with the new Whig Congress in signing into law such measures as a preemption bill granting  squatters  sovereignty  to settlers on public land  a Distribution Act  discussed below   a new bankruptcy law  and the repeal of the Independent Treasury enacted under Van Buren  But when it came to the great banking question  Tyler was soon at odds with the Congressional Whigs  Twice he vetoed Clay s legislation for a national banking act  Although the second bill supposedly had been tailored to meet his stated objections in the first veto  its final version did not  This practice  designed to protect Clay from having a successful incumbent president as a rival for the Whig nomination in 1844  became known as  heading Captain Tyler   a term coined by Whig Representative John Minor Botts of Virginia  Tyler proposed an alternative fiscal plan to be known as the  Exchequer   but Clay s friends  who controlled the Congress  would have none of it     On September 11  1841  following the second bank veto  members of the cabinet entered Tyler s office one by one and resignedan orchestration by Clay to force Tyler s resignation and place his own lieutenant  Senate President pro tempore Samuel L  Southard   in the White House  The only exception was Webster  who remained to finalize what became the 1842 WebsterAshburton Treaty   and to demonstrate his independence from Clay    When told by Webster that he was willing to stay  Tyler is reported to have said   Give me your hand on that  and now I will say to you that Henry Clay is a doomed man     On September 13  when the president did not resign or give in  the Whigs in Congress expelled Tyler from the party  Tyler was lambasted by Whig newspapers and received hundreds of letters threatening his assassination    Whigs in Congress were so angry with Tyler that they refused to allocate funds for the repair of the White House  which had fallen into disrepair     By mid 1841  the federal government faced a projected budget deficit of  11 million  Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs  but wished to stay within the 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff   He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land  as an emergency measure to manage the states  growing debt  even though this would cut federal revenue  The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure  and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise  The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program  with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent  a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low tax goods  Despite these measures  by March 1842 it had become clear that the federal government was still in dire fiscal straits     The root of the trouble was an economic crisisinitiated by the Panic of 1837 which was entering its sixth year in 1842  A speculative bubble had burst in 183639  causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression  The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis  Almost all of President Tylers cabinet had resigned in September 1841  after he vetoed two successive attempts to re establish a central bank for the United States  Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming  A decade earlier  when the economy was strong  Congress had promised Southern states that there would be a reduction in hated federal tariffs  Northern states welcomed tariffs  which protected their infant industries  But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton    In a recommendation to Congress  Tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit  Under the previous deal  this would suspend the distribution program  with all revenues going to the federal government     The defiant Whig Congress would not raise tariffs in a way that would affect the distribution of funds to states  In June 1842 they passed two bills that would raise tariffs and unconditionally extend the distribution program  Believing it improper to continue distribution at a time when federal revenue shortage necessitated increasing the tariff  Tyler vetoed both bills  burning any remaining bridges between himself and the Whigs    Congress tried again  combining the two into one bill  Tyler vetoed it again  to the outrage of many in Congress  who nevertheless failed to override the veto  As some action was necessary  Whigs in Congress passed  in each house by one vote  a bill restoring tariffs to 1832 levels and ending the distribution program  Tyler signed the Tariff of 1842 on August 30  pocket vetoing a separate bill to restore distribution     Shortly after the tariff vetoes  Whigs in the House of Representatives initiated American history s first impeachment proceedings against a president  This was not only a matter of the Whigs  support of legislation Tyler vetoed  until the presidency of the Whigs  arch enemy Andrew Jackson  presidents rarely vetoed bills  and then  generally only on the grounds of whether or not something was unconstitutional  Tyler s actions opposed the Whigs  opinion that the presidency should allow Congress to make decisions regarding policy    Congressman John Botts   who opposed Tyler  introduced a resolution on July 10  1842  It levied several charges against Tyler and called for a nine member committee to investigate his behavior  with the expectation of a formal impeachment recommendation  Clay found this measure prematurely aggressive  favoring a more moderate progression toward Tyler s  inevitable  impeachment  The Botts bill was tabled until the following January  when it was rejected  127 83     A House select committee   headed by John Quincy Adams  condemned the president s use of the veto and assailed his character  Adams  an ardent abolitionist  disliked the fact that Tyler was a slaveholder  While the committee s report did not formally recommend impeachment  it clearly established the possibility  In August 1842  by a vote of 9890  the House endorsed the committee s report  Adams sponsored a constitutional amendment to change both houses  two thirds requirement  for overriding vetoes  to a simple majority  but neither house passed such a measure    The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress   as in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House  Near the end of Tyler s term in office  on March 3  1845  Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters   This was the first overriding of any presidential veto in US history     The battles between Tyler and the Whigs in Congress resulted in a number of his nominees being rejected  He received little support from Democrats and  without much support from either major party in Congress  a number of his nominations were rejected without regard for the qualifications of the nominee  To reject a president s nominees for his Cabinet was unprecedented  though in 1809  James Madison had withheld the nomination of Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin as Secretary of State because of opposition in the Senate  A Cabinet nominee would not fail of confirmation  after Tyler s term  until Henry Stanbery  s nomination as Attorney General was rejected by the Senate in 1868     Four of Tyler s Cabinet nominees were rejected  the most of any president  These were Caleb Cushing  Treasury   David Henshaw  Navy  James Porter  War   and James S  Green  Treasury   Henshaw and Porter served as recess appointees before their rejections  Tyler repeatedly renominated Cushing  who was rejected three times in one day  March 3  1843  the last day of the 27th Congress     Tyler s difficulties in domestic policy contrasted with notable accomplishments in foreign policy  He had long been an advocate of expansionism toward the Pacific and free trade   and was fond of evoking themes of national destiny and the spread of liberty in support of these policies    His policies were largely in line with Jackson s earlier efforts to promote American commerce across the Pacific    Eager to compete with Great Britain in international markets  he sent lawyer Caleb Cushing to China  where he negotiated the terms of the Treaty of Wanghia  1844     The same year  he sent Henry Wheaton as a minister to Berlin   where he negotiated and signed a trade agreement with the Zollverein   a coalition of German states that managed tariffs  This treaty was rejected by the Whigs  mainly as a show of hostility toward the Tyler administration   In an 1842 special message to Congress  the president also applied the Monroe Doctrine to Hawaii  dubbed the  Tyler Doctrine      told Britain not to interfere there  and began a process that led to the eventual annexation of Hawaii by the United States     In 1842 Secretary of State Daniel Webster negotiated with Britain the WebsterAshburton Treaty   which concluded where the border between Maine and Canada lay  That issue had caused tension between the United States and Britain for decades and had brought the two countries to the brink of war on several occasions  The treaty improved Anglo American diplomatic relations    However  Tyler was unsuccessful in concluding a treaty with the British to fix the boundaries of Oregon    On Tyler s last full day in office  March 3  1845  Florida was admitted to the Union as the 27th state     Tyler advocated an increase in military strength  His administration drew praise from naval leaders  who saw a marked increase in warships  Tyler brought the long  bloody Second Seminole War to an end in 1842  and expressed interest in the forced cultural assimilation of the Native Americans     He also advocated the establishment of a chain of American forts from Council Bluffs  Iowa   to the Pacific     In May 1842  when the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island came to a head  Tyler pondered the request of the governor and legislature to send federal troops to help it suppress the Dorrite insurgents  The insurgents under Thomas Dorr had armed themselves and proposed to install a new state constitution  Before such acts  Rhode Island had been following the same constitutional structure that was established in 1663  Tyler called for calm on both sides  and recommended that the governor enlarge the franchise to let most men vote  Tyler promised that in case an actual insurrection should break out in Rhode Island he would employ force to aid the regular  or Charter  government  He made it clear that federal assistance would be given  not to prevent  but only to put down insurrection  and would not be available until violence had been committed  After listening to reports from his confidential agents  Tyler decided that the  lawless assemblages  had dispersed and expressed his confidence in a  temper of conciliation as well as of energy and decision   He did not send any federal forces  The rebels fled the state when the state militia marched against them  but the incident led to broader suffrage in Rhode Island     Two vacancies occurred on the Supreme Court during Tyler s presidency  as Justices Smith Thompson and Henry Baldwin died in 1843 and 1844  respectively  Tyler  ever at odds with Congressincluding the Whig controlled Senatenominated several men to the Supreme Court to fill these seats  However  the Senate successively voted against confirming John Canfield Spencer   Reuben Walworth   Edward King and John M  Read  King was rejected twice   One reason cited for the Senate s actions was the hope that Clay would fill the vacancies after winning the 1844 presidential election    Tyler s four unsuccessful nominees are the most by a president     Finally  in February 1845  with less than a month remaining in his term  Tyler s nomination of Samuel Nelson to Thompson s seat was confirmed by the Senate  Nelson  a Democrat  had a reputation as a careful and noncontroversial jurist  Still  his confirmation came as a surprise  Baldwin s seat remained vacant until James K  Polk  s nominee  Robert Grier   was confirmed in 1846     Tyler was able to appoint only six other federal judges  all to United States district courts      Tyler made the annexation of the Republic of Texas part of his platform soon after becoming president  Texas had declared independence from Mexico in the Texas Revolution of 1836  although Mexico still refused to acknowledge it as a sovereign state  The people of Texas actively pursued joining the Union  but Jackson and Van Buren had been reluctant to inflame tensions over slavery by annexing another Southern state  Tyler  on the other hand  intended annexation to be the focal point of his administration  Secretary Webster was opposed  he convinced Tyler to focus on Pacific initiatives until later in his term    Although Tyler s desire for western expansionism is agreed upon by historians and scholars  views differ regarding the motivations behind it  Biographer Edward C  Crapol notes that during the presidency of James Monroe   Tyler  then in the House of Representatives  had suggested slavery was a  dark cloud  hovering over the Union  and that it would be  well to disperse this cloud  so that with fewer blacks in the older slave states  a process of gradual emancipation would begin in Virginia and other upper Southern states    Historian William W  Freehling  however  wrote that Tyler s official motivation in annexing Texas was to outmaneuver suspected efforts by Great Britain to promote an emancipation of slaves in Texas that would weaken the institution in the United States     In early 1843  having completed the WebsterAshburton treaty and other diplomatic efforts  Tyler felt ready to pursue Texas  Now lacking a party base  he saw annexation of the republic as his only pathway to independent re election in 1844  For the first time in his career he was willing to play  political hardball  to see it through  As a trial balloon he dispatched his ally Thomas Walker Gilmer   then a U S  Representative from Virginia  to publish a letter defending annexation  which was well received  Despite his successful relationship with Webster  Tyler knew he would need a Secretary of State who supported the Texas initiative  Recognizing this shift in the president s focus  and with his work on the British treaty now completed  he forced Webster s resignation and installed Hugh S  Legar of South Carolina as an interim successor     With the help of newly appointed Treasury Secretary John C  Spencer   Tyler cleared out an array of officeholders  replacing them with pro annexation partisans  in a reversal of his former stand against patronage  He elicited the help of political organizer Michael Walsh to build a political machine in New York  In exchange for an appointment as consul to Hawaii   journalist Alexander G  Abell wrote a flattering biography  Life of John Tyler   which was printed in large quantities and given to postmasters to distribute    Seeking to rehabilitate his public image  Tyler embarked on a nationwide tour in the spring of 1843  The positive reception of the public at these events contrasted with his ostracism back in Washington  The tour centered on the dedication of the Bunker Hill Monument in Boston  Massachusetts  Shortly after the dedication  Tyler learned of Legar s sudden death  which dampened the festivities and caused him to cancel the rest of the tour     Tyler appointed Abel P  Upshur   a popular Secretary of the Navy and close adviser  as his new Secretary of State  and nominated Gilmer to fill Upshur s former office  Tyler and Upshur began quiet negotiations with the Texas government  promising military protection from Mexico in exchange for a commitment to annexation  Secrecy was necessary  as the Constitution required congressional approval for such military commitments  Upshur planted rumors of possible British designs on Texas to drum up support among Northern voters  who were wary of admitting a new pro slavery state    By January 1844 Upshur told the Texas government that he had found a large majority of senators in favor of an annexation treaty  The republic remained skeptical  and finalization of the treaty took until the end of February     A ceremonial cruise down the Potomac River was held aboard the newly built USS Princeton on February 28  1844  the day after completion of the treaty  Aboard the ship were 400 guests  including Tyler and his cabinet  as was the world s largest naval gun  the  Peacemaker   The gun was ceremonially fired several times in the afternoon to the great delight of the onlookers  who then filed downstairs to offer a toast  Several hours later  Captain Robert F  Stockton was convinced by the crowd to fire one more shot  As the guests moved up to the deck  Tyler paused briefly to watch his son in law  William Waller  sing a ditty     At once an explosion was heard from above  the gun had malfunctioned  Tyler was unhurt  having remained safely below deck  but a number of others were killed instantly  including his crucial cabinet members  Gilmer and Upshur  Also killed or mortally wounded were Virgil Maxcy of Maryland  Rep  David Gardiner of New York  Commodore Beverly Kennon   Chief of Construction of the United States Navy   and Armistead  Tyler s black slave and body servant  The death of David Gardiner had a devastating effect on his daughter  Julia   who fainted and was carried to safety by the president himself    Julia later recovered from her grief and married President Tyler     For Tyler  any hope of completing the Texas plan before November  and with it  any hope of re election  was instantly dashed  Historian Edward P  Crapol later wrote that  Prior to the Civil War and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln   the Princeton disaster  unquestionably was the most severe and debilitating tragedy ever to confront a President of the United States      In what the Miller Center of Public Affairs considers  a serious tactical error that ruined the scheme  of establishing political respectability for him      Tyler appointed former Vice President John C  Calhoun in early March 1844 as his Secretary of State  Tyler s good friend  Virginia Representative Henry A  Wise   wrote that following the Princeton disaster  Wise went on his own to extend Calhoun the position through a colleague  who assumed that the offer came from the president  When Wise went to tell Tyler what he had done  the president was angry but felt that the action now had to stand  Calhoun was a leading advocate of slavery  and his attempts to get an annexation treaty passed were resisted by abolitionists as a result  When the text of the treaty was leaked to the public  it met political opposition from the Whigs  who would oppose anything that might enhance Tyler s status  as well as from foes of slavery and those who feared a confrontation with Mexico  which had announced that it would view annexation as a hostile act by the United States  Both Clay and Van Buren  the respective frontrunners for the Whig and Democratic nominations  decided in a private meeting at Van Buren s home to come out against annexation    Knowing this  when Tyler sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification in April 1844  he did not expect it to pass     Following Tyler s break with the Whigs in 1841  he had begun to shift back to his old Democratic party  but its members  especially the followers of Van Buren  were not ready to receive him  He knew that  with little chance of election  the only way to salvage his presidency and legacy was to move public opinion in favor of the Texas issue  He formed a third party  the Democratic Republicans  using the officeholders and political networks he had built over the previous year  A chain of pro Tyler newspapers across the country put out editorials promoting his candidacy throughout the early months of 1844  Reports of meetings held throughout the country suggest that support for the president was not limited to officeholders  as is often inferred  The Tyler supporters  holding signs reading  Tyler and Texas    held their nominating convention in Baltimore in May 1844  just as the Democratic Party was holding its presidential nomination  With their high visibility and energy as they gave Tyler their own nomination  they were able to force the Democrats  hand in favor of annexation  Ballot after ballot  Van Buren failed to win the necessary super majority of Democratic votes  and slowly fell in the ranking  It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats turned their sights to James K  Polk   a less prominent candidate who supported annexation  They found him to be perfectly suited for their platform  and he was nominated with two thirds of the vote  Tyler considered his work vindicated  and implied in an acceptance letter that annexation was his true priority rather than election     Tyler was unfazed when the Whig controlled Senate rejected his treaty by a vote of 1635 in June 1844  as he felt that annexation was now within reach  He called for Congress to annex Texas by joint resolution rather than by treaty  Former President Andrew Jackson  a staunch supporter of annexation  persuaded Polk to welcome Tyler back into the Democratic party and ordered Democratic editors to cease their attacks on him  Satisfied by these developments  Tyler dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Polk for the presidency  Polk s narrow victory over Clay in the November election was seen by the Tyler administration as a mandate for completing the resolution  Tyler announced in his annual message to Congress that  a controlling majority of the people and a large majority of the states have declared in favor of immediate annexation     In late February 1845  the House by a substantial margin and the Senate by a bare 2725 majority approved a joint resolution offering terms of annexation to Texas  On March 1  three days before the end of his term  Tyler signed the bill into law    After some debate    Texas accepted the terms and entered the union on December 29  1845  as the 28th state     Tyler fathered more children than any other American president in history    His first wife was Letitia Christian  November 12  1790  September 10  1842   with whom he had eight children  Mary  18151847   Robert  18161877   John  18191896   Letitia  18211907   Elizabeth  18231850   Anne  18251825   Alice  18271854  and Tazewell  18301874      Tyler s wife Letitia died of a stroke in the White House in September 1842  His second wife was Julia Gardiner  July 23  1820  July 10  1889   with whom he had seven children  David  18461927   John Alexander  18481883   Julia  18491871   Lachlan  18511902   Lyon  18531935   Robert Fitzwalter  18561927  and Pearl  18601947      Although Tyler s family was dear to him  during his political rise he was often away from home for extended periods  As a Southern gentleman  duty was important to Tyler  including his duties to his family  When Tyler chose not to seek re election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness  he wrote that he would soon be called upon to educate his growing family  It was difficult to practice law while away in Washington part of the year  and his plantation was more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself    By the time he entered the Senate in 1827  he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his growing family  Still  he sought to remain close to his children through letters     In December 1841  Tyler was attacked by abolitionist publisher Joshua Leavitt   who alleged that Tyler had fathered several sons with his slaves  and later sold his offspring  A number of African American families today have an oral tradition of descent from Tyler  but no firm evidence of such a link has ever surfaced     As of August 2015  Tyler has two living grandsons through his son Lyon Gardiner Tyler  he is the earliest former president with living grandchildren    Lyon Gardiner Tyler  Jr  was born in 1924  and Harrison Ruffin Tyler was born in 1928  Lyon Tyler Jr  resides in Franklin  Tennessee  and Harrison Tyler maintains the family home  Sherwood Forest Plantation in Charles City County  Virginia          Tyler retired to a Virginia plantation   originally named Walnut Grove  or  the Grove    located on the James River in Charles City County  He renamed it Sherwood Forest   in a reference to the folk legend Robin Hood   to signify that he had been  outlawed  by the Whig Party    He did not take farming lightly and worked hard to maintain large yields    His neighbors  largely Whigs  appointed him  overseer  of his road in 1847 in an effort to mock him  To their displeasure he treated the title seriously  frequently summoning his neighbors  slaves to attend to road work  and continued to bear the title even after his neighbors asked him to stop    He withdrew from politics  rarely receiving visits from his friends  He was asked to give an occasional public speech  but was not sought out as an adviser  One notable speech was at the unveiling of a monument to Henry Clay  acknowledging the political battles between the two  he spoke highly of his former colleague  whom he had always admired for bringing about the Compromise Tariff of 1833    The former president s time was spent with the doings of the Virginia aristocracy  including parties  visiting or being visited by prominent families  and summers at the family seaside home   Villa Margaret      On the eve of the Civil War   Tyler re entered public life as sponsor and chairman of the Virginia Peace Convention   held in Washington  D C   in February 1861 as an effort to devise means to prevent a war  The convention sought a compromise to avoid civil war even as the Confederate Constitution was being drawn up at the Montgomery Convention   When the convention s proposals were rejected by Congress  Tyler abandoned hope of compromise and saw secession as the only option  predicting that a clean split of all Southern states would not result in war    When war ultimately broke out  Tyler unhesitatingly sided with Virginia  which eventually joined the Confederacy  the former American president was sent as a delegate to the Provisional Confederate Congress   Julia Tyler was an ardent supporter of the Southern cause despite her Northern birth  Her husband was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives   On January 5  1862  he left for the Confederate capital  Richmond  in anticipation of his congressional service  but did not live to see the opening sessions       Throughout Tyler s life  he suffered from poor health  As he aged  he suffered more frequently from colds during the winter  On January 12  1862  after complaining of chills and dizziness  he vomited and collapsed  He was treated  but his health did not improve  and he made plans to return to Sherwood Forest by the 18th  As he lay in bed the night before  he began suffocating  and Julia summoned his doctor  Just after midnight  Tyler took a last sip of brandy   and told his doctor   I am going  Perhaps it is best     He died shortly thereafter  most likely due to a stroke     Tyler s death was the only one in presidential history not to be officially recognized in Washington  because of his allegiance to the Confederacy   He had requested a simple burial  but Confederate President Jefferson Davis devised a grand  politically pointed funeral  painting Tyler as a hero to the new nation  Accordingly  at his funeral  the coffin of the tenth president of the United States was draped with a Confederate flag   the only former president ever to be buried and honored ceremoniously under a foreign non US flag     Tyler is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond  Virginia  in front of the gravesite of former President James Monroe   the black structure visible in the illustration behind the left side of Tyler s obelisk    Tyler has since been the namesake of several U S  locations  including the city of Tyler  Texas   named for him because of his role in the annexation of Texas     Tyler s presidency has provoked highly divided responses among political commentators  It is generally held in low esteem by historians  Edward P  Crapol began his biography John Tyler  the Accidental President  2006  by noting   Other biographers and historians have argued that John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed     In The Republican Vision of John Tyler  2003   Dan Monroe observed that the Tyler presidency  is generally ranked as one of the least successful     Seager wrote that Tyler  was neither a great president nor a great intellectual   adding that despite a few achievements   his administration has been and must be counted an unsuccessful one by any modern measure of accomplishment     A survey of 65 historians  conducted by C SPAN in 2009  ranked Tyler as 35th of 42 men to hold the office     Tyler s assumption of complete presidential powers  set a hugely important precedent   according to a biographical sketch by the University of Virginia  s Miller Center of Public Affairs     Tyler s successful insistence that he was president  and not a caretaker or acting president  was a model for the succession of seven other presidents over the 19th and 20th centuries  Tyler s action of assuming both the title of the presidency and its full powers would be legally recognized in 1967  when it was codified in the Twenty fifth Amendment      Some scholars in recent years have praised Tyler s foreign policy  Monroe credits him with  achievements like the WebsterAshburton treaty which heralded the prospect of improved relations with Great Britain  and the annexation of Texas  which added millions of acres to the national domain   Crapol argued that Tyler  was a stronger and more effective president than generally remembered   while Seager wrote   I find him to be a courageous  principled man  a fair and honest fighter for his beliefs  He was a president without a party     Author Ivan Eland   in an update of his 2008 book Recarving Rushmore   rated all 44 US presidents by the criteria of peace  prosperity  and liberty  with the finished ratings  John Tyler was ranked the best president of all time    Louis Kleber  in his article in History Today   pointed out that Tyler brought integrity to the White House at a time when many in politics lacked it  and refused to compromise his principles to avoid the anger of his opponents    Crapol argues that Tyler s allegiance to the Confederacy overshadows much of the good he did as president   John Tyler s historical reputation has yet to fully recover from that tragic decision to betray his loyalty and commitment to what he had once defined as  the first great American interest the preservation of the Union      Norma Lois Peterson  in her book on Tyler s presidency  suggested that Tyler s general lack of success as president was due to external factors  that would have rebounded upon whoever was in the White House  Chief among them was Henry Clay  who was determined to realize the vision he had for America   and who would brook no opposition  In the aftermath of Jackson s determined use of the powers of the Executive Branch  the Whigs wanted the president to be dominated by Congress  and Clay treated Tyler as a subordinate  Tyler resented this  leading to the conflict between the branches that dominated his presidency    Pointing to Tyler s advances in foreign policy  she deemed Tyler s presidency  flawed    but it was not a failure      While academics have both praised and criticized Tyler  the general American public has little awareness of him at all  Several writers have portrayed Tyler as among the nation s most obscure presidents  As Seager remarked   His countrymen generally remember him  if they have heard of him at all  as the rhyming end of a catchy campaign slogan       Explanatory notes  Bibliography  Books  Articles  Archival collections  Citations ", "Garfield": "Childhood Education 2C

March 4  1881 until his assassination later that year  Garfield had served nine terms in the House of Representatives  and had been elected to the Senate before his candidacy for the White House   though he declined the senatorship once he was president elect   He is the only sitting House member to be elected president     Garfield was raised in humble circumstances on an Ohio farm by his widowed mother  He worked at various jobs  including on a canal boat   in his youth  Beginning at age 17  he attended several Ohio schools  then studied at Williams College in Williamstown  Massachusetts   from which he graduated in 1856  A year later  Garfield entered politics as a Republican   He married Lucretia Rudolph in 1858  and served as a member of the Ohio State Senate  18591861   Garfield opposed Confederate secession   served as a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War   and fought in the battles of Middle Creek   Shiloh   and Chickamauga   He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio s 19th District   Throughout Garfield s extended congressional service after the Civil War  he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator  Garfield initially agreed with Radical Republican views regarding Reconstruction   but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen    At the 1880 Republican National Convention   Senator elect Garfield attended as campaign manager for Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman   and gave the presidential nomination speech for him  When neither Sherman nor his rivals Ulysses S  Grant and James G  Blaine  could get enough votes to secure the nomination  delegates chose Garfield as a compromise on the 36th ballot  In the 1880 presidential election   Garfield conducted a low key front porch campaign   and narrowly defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock    Garfield s accomplishments as president included a resurgence of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments  energizing American naval power  and purging corruption in the Post Office   all during his extremely short time in office  Garfield made notable diplomatic and judiciary appointments  including a U S  Supreme Court justice  He enhanced the powers of the presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H  Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York   starting a fracas that ended with Robertson s confirmation and Conkling s resignation from the Senate  Garfield advocated agricultural technology  an educated electorate  and civil rights for African Americans   He also proposed substantial civil service reform  eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor  Chester A  Arthur   as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act   With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days  and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack  Garfield is little remembered in the American cultural memory other than for his assassination  historians often forego listing him in rankings of U S  presidents due to the short length of his presidency     James Garfield was born the youngest of five children on November 19  1831  in a log cabin in Orange Township   now Moreland Hills  Ohio   Orange Township was located in the Western Reserve   and like many who settled there  Garfield s ancestors were from New England  James  father Abram had been born in Worcester  New York and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart  Mehitabel Ballou  only to find her married  He instead wed her sister Eliza  who had been born in New Hampshire  James was named for an older brother  dead in infancy     In early 1833  Abram and Eliza Garfield joined the Disciples of Christ   a decision that would help shape their youngest son s life    Abram Garfield died later that year  his son was raised in poverty in a household led by the strong willed Eliza    James was her favorite child  and the two remained close for the rest of her life    Eliza Garfield remarried in 1842  but soon left her second husband  Warren Belden  possibly Alfred Belden   and a then scandalous divorce was awarded against her in 1850  James took his mother s side  and when Belden died in 1880 noted the fact in his diary with satisfaction    Garfield enjoyed his mother s stories about his ancestry  especially his Welsh great great grandfathers and his ancestor who served as a knight of Caerffili Castle      Poor and fatherless  Garfield was mocked by his fellow boys  and throughout his life was very sensitive to slights  He escaped through reading  devouring all the books he could find    He left home at age 16 in 1847  Rejected by the only ship in port in Cleveland   Garfield instead found work on a canal boat  responsible for managing the mules that pulled it    This labor would be used to good effect by Horatio Alger   who penned Garfield s campaign biography in 1880     After six weeks  illness forced Garfield to return home and  during his recuperation  his mother and a local education official got him to promise to postpone his return to the canals for a year and go to school  Accordingly  in 1848  he began at Geauga Seminary  in nearby Chester Township     Garfield later said of his childhood   I lament that I was born to poverty  and in this chaos of childhood  seventeen years passed before I caught any inspiration    a precious 17 years when a boy with a father and some wealth might have become fixed in manly ways      At Geauga Academy  which he attended from 1848 to 1850  Garfield learned academic subjects he had not previously had time for  He shone as a student  and was especially interested in languages and elocution  He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience  writing that the speaker s platform  creates some excitement  I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error     Geauga was co educational  and Garfield was attracted to one of his fellow students  Lucretia Rudolph   whom he later married    To support himself at Geauga  he worked as a carpenter s assistant and as a teacher    The need to go from town to town to find a place as a teacher disgusted Garfield  and he thereafter developed a dislike of what he called  place seeking   which became  he said   the law of my life     In later years  he would astound his friends by letting positions pass that could have been his with a little politicking    Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God  but in his late teens underwent a religious awakening  and attended many camp meetings   at one of which he was born again   The next day  March 4  1850  he was baptized into the Disciples by being submerged in the icy waters of the Chagrin River      After leaving Geauga  Garfield worked for a year at various jobs  including teaching    Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college  Garfield determined to do the same  and first sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations  From 1851 to 1854  he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute  later named Hiram College   in Hiram  Ohio   a school run by the Disciples  While there  he was most interested in the study of Greek and Latin  but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered    Securing a position on entry as janitor   he was hired to teach while still a student    Lucretia Rudolph had also enrolled at the Institute  and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek    He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches  in some cases earning a gold dollar per service  By 1854  Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full time teacher    Garfield then enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown  Massachusetts   as a third year student   given credit for two year s study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination  Garfield was impressed with the college president  Mark Hopkins   who had responded warmly to Garfield s letter inquiring about admission  He said of Hopkins   The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other     Hopkins later stated about Garfield in his student days   There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject  There was no pretense of genius  or alternation of spasmodic effort  but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions     After his first term  Garfield was hired to teach penmanship to the students of nearby Pownal  Vermont a post whose previous incumbent was Chester A  Arthur      Garfield graduated from Williams in August 1856 as salutatorian   giving an address at the commencement   Garfield biographer Ira Rutkow pointed out that the future president s years at Williams gave Garfield the opportunity to know and respect those of different social backgrounds  and despite his origin as an unsophisticated Westerner  he was liked and respected by socially conscious New Englanders   In short   as Rutkow later wrote   Garfield had an extensive and positive first experience with the world outside the Western Reserve of Ohio      On his return to Ohio  the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction  He returned to Hiram to teach at the Institute  and in 1857 was made its president  He did not see education as a field in which he could realize his full potential  At Williams  he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school  and began to consider politics as a career    In 1858  he married Lucretia  they would have seven children  five of whom survived infancy    Soon after the wedding  he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm  although he did his studying in Hiram    He was admitted to the bar in 1861     Local Republican Party leaders invited Garfield to enter politics upon the death of Cyrus Prentiss  the presumptive nominee for the local state senate seat  He was nominated by the party convention on the sixth ballot  and was elected  serving until 1861    Garfield s major effort in the state senate was a bill providing for Ohio s first geological survey to measure its mineral resources  though it failed     After Abraham Lincoln  s election as president  several Southern states announced their secession from the Union to form a new government  the Confederate States of America   Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort  which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power     In April 1861  the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter   one of the last federal outposts in the South  beginning the Civil War   Although he had no military training  Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army     At Governor William Dennison s request  Garfield deferred his military ambitions to remain in the legislature  where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio s volunteer regiments    Afterward  the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring and early summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio  encouraging enlistment in the new regiments    Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets  Garfield returned to Ohio and  in August 1861  received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment    The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper  so Garfield s first task was to fill its ranks  He did so quickly  recruiting many of his neighbors and former students    The regiment traveled to Camp Chase   outside Columbus  Ohio   to complete training    In December  Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky  where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell      Buell quickly assigned Garfield the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky  giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign which  besides his own 42nd  included the 40th Ohio Infantry   two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units    They departed Catlettsburg  Kentucky   in mid December  advancing through the valley of the Big Sandy River     The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville  Kentucky   on January 6  1862  where Garfield s cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny s Creek    Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield s own  but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered    Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek  on the road to Virginia  Garfield ordered his troops to pursue the Confederates    They attacked the rebel positions on January 9  1862  in the Battle of Middle Creek   the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded    At the end of the fighting  the Confederates withdrew from the field  and Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision     In recognition of his success  Garfield was promoted to brigadier general    After Marshall s retreat  Garfield s command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky  and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union    The proclamation was surprisingly lenient  as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery    Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap   the last rebel units in the area were outflanked  and they retreated to Virginia     Garfield s promotion gave him command of the 20th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio  which was ordered in early 1862 to join Major General Ulysses S  Grant  s forces as they advanced on Corinth  Mississippi     Before the 20th Brigade arrived  however  Confederate forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston surprised Grant s men in their camps  driving them back    Garfield s troops got word of the battle and advanced quickly  joining the rest of the army on the second day to drive the Confederates back across the field and into retreat    The action  later known as the Battle of Shiloh   was the bloodiest of the war to date  Garfield was exposed to fire for much of the day  but emerged uninjured    Major General Henry W  Halleck   Grant s superior  took charge of the combined armies and advanced ponderously toward Corinth  when they arrived  the Confederates had fled     That summer Garfield suffered from jaundice and significant weight loss    b     He was forced to return home  where his wife nursed him back to health    While he was home  Garfield s friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress  although he refused to politick with the delegates    He returned to duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment    During this period of idleness  a rumor of an extra marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it    Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn  to his frustration    In the meantime  he served on the court martial of Fitz John Porter   a sensational trial in which Porter was tried for his tardiness at the Second Battle of Bull Run     He was convinced of Porter s guilt  and voted with his fellow generals to convict    The trial lasted almost two months  from November 1862 to January 1863  and by the end of it  Garfield had at last procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General William S  Rosecrans      The position of Chief of Staff for a general was usually held by a more junior officer  but Garfield s influence with Rosecrans was greater than usual  with duties extending beyond mere communication of orders to actual management of his Army of the Cumberland     Rosecrans had a voracious appetite for conversation  especially when he was unable to sleep  in Garfield  he found  the first well read person in the Army  and the ideal candidate for discussions that ran deep into the night    The two became close  and their talks covered all topics  especially religion  Rosecrans  who had converted from Methodism to Roman Catholicism   succeeded in softening Garfield s view of his faith    Garfield recommended that Rosecrans replace wing commanders Alexander McCook and Thomas Crittenden   whom he believed ineffective  Rosecrans ignored the suggestions    With Rosecrans  Garfield devised the Tullahoma Campaign to pursue and trap Confederate General Braxton Bragg in Tullahoma   After initial Union success  Bragg retreated toward Chattanooga   where Rosecrans stalled and requested more troops and supplies    Garfield argued for an immediate advance  in line with demands from Halleck and Lincoln    After a council of war and lengthy deliberations  Rosecrans agreed to attack     At the ensuing Battle of Chickamauga on September 19 and 20  1863  confusion among the wing commanders over Rosecrans s orders created a gap in the lines  resulting in a rout of the right flank  Rosecrans concluded that the battle was lost and fell back on Chattanooga to establish a defensive line    Garfield  however  thought that part of the army had held and  with Rosecrans s approval  headed across Missionary Ridge to survey the scene  Garfield s hunch was correct    His ride became legendary  while Rosecrans  error reignited criticism about his leadership    While Rosecrans s army had avoided disaster  they were stranded in Chattanooga  surrounded by Bragg s army  Garfield sent a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin M  Stanton alerting Washington to the need for reinforcements to avoid annihilation  and Lincoln and Halleck delivered 20 000 troops by rail within nine days    In the meantime  Grant was promoted to command of the western armies  and quickly replaced Rosecrans with George H  Thomas     Garfield was ordered to report to Washington  where he was promoted to major general  a commission he would resign before taking a seat in the House of Representatives    According to historian Jean Edward Smith   Grant and Garfield had a  guarded relationship   since Grant promoted Thomas to command of the Army of the Cumberland  rather than Garfield  after Rosecrans was dismissed     While serving in the army in early 1862  Garfield was approached by friends about running for Congress from Ohio s newly redrawn  heavily Republican 19th district   He was worried that he and other state appointed generals would get obscure assignments  and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career  The fact that the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863   c   would allow him to continue his war service for a time  Home on medical leave  he refused to campaign for the nomination  leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862  on the eighth ballot  In October  he defeated D B  Woods by a two to one margin in the general election for a seat in the 38th Congress      Soon after the nomination  Garfield was ordered to report to War Secretary Edwin Stanton in Washington to discuss his military future  There  Garfield met Treasury Secretary Salmon P  Chase   who befriended him  seeing him as a younger version of himself  The two men agreed politically  and both were part of the Radical wing of the Republican Party    Once he took his seat in December 1863  Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard  Many radicals  led in the House by Pennsylvania s Thaddeus Stevens   wanted lands owned by rebels to be confiscated  but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that would do that on a widespread basis  Garfield  in debate on the House floor  supported such legislation and  discussing England s Glorious Revolution   hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills    Although Garfield had supported Lincoln s Emancipation Proclamation   the congressman marveled that it was a  strange phenomenon in the world s history  when a second rate Illinois lawyer is the instrument to utter words which shall form an epoch memorable in all future ages      Garfield not only favored abolition  but believed that the leaders of the rebellion had forfeited their constitutional rights  He supported the confiscation of southern plantations and even exile or execution of rebellion leaders as a means to ensure the permanent destruction of slavery    He felt Congress was obliged  to determine what legislation is necessary to secure equal justice to all loyal persons  without regard to color     Garfield was more supportive when Lincoln took action against slavery    Early in his tenure  he differed from his party on several issues  his was the solitary Republican vote to terminate the use of bounties in recruiting  Some financially able recruits had used the bounty system to buy their way out of service  called commutation   which Garfield considered reprehensible    Garfield gave a speech pointing out the flaws in the existing conscription law  that of 300 000 called upon to enlist  barely 10 000 had  the remainder claiming exemption or providing money or a substitute  Lincoln appeared before the Military Affairs committee on which Garfield served  demanding a more effective bill  even if it cost him re election  Lincoln was confident he could win the war before his term expired    After many false starts  Garfield  with the support of Lincoln  procured the passage of a conscription bill which excluded commutation     Under Chase s influence  Garfield became a staunch proponent of a dollar backed by a gold standard   and was therefore a strong opponent of the   greenback    he regretted very much  but understood  the necessity for suspension of payment in gold or silver during the emergency presented by the Civil War    Garfield voted with the Radical Republicans in passing the WadeDavis Bill   designed to give Congress more authority over Reconstruction   but it was defeated by Lincoln s pocket veto      Garfield did not consider Lincoln particularly worthy of re election  but no viable alternative seemed available   He will probably be the man  though I think we could do better     The Ohioan attended the party convention and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln s running mate  but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson     Both Lincoln and Garfield were re elected    By then  Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed Chief Justice   and his relations with Garfield became more distant     Garfield took up the practice of law in 1865 as a means to improve his personal finances  His efforts took him to Wall Street where  the day after Lincoln s assassination  a riotous crowd led him into an impromptu speech to calm it   Fellow citizens  Clouds and darkness are round about Him  His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies  Justice and judgment are the establishment of His throne  Mercy and truth shall go before His face  Fellow citizens  God reigns  and the Government at Washington still lives     The speech  with no mention or praise of Lincoln  was according to Garfield biographer Robert G  Caldwell  quite as significant for what it did not contain as for what it did     In the following years  Garfield had more praise for Lincoln  a year after the Illinoisan s death Garfield stated that  greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln   and in 1878 called Lincoln  one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power      After the war  Garfield became a proponent of black suffrage  though he admitted that the idea of African Americans as political equals with whites gave him  a strong feeling of repugnance     The new president  Johnson  sought the rapid restoration of the Southern states during the months between his accession and the meeting of Congress in December 1865  Garfield hesitantly supported this policy as an experiment  Johnson  an old friend  sought Garfield s backing  and their conversations led Garfield to assume that differences between president and Congress were not large  When Congress assembled in December  to Johnson s chagrin without the elected representatives of the Southern states  who were excluded   Garfield urged conciliation on his colleagues  although he feared that Johnson  a former Democrat  might combine with other Democrats to gain political control if he rejoined the party  Garfield foresaw conflict even before February 1866 when Johnson vetoed a bill to extend the life of the Freedmen s Bureau   charged with aiding the former slaves  By April  Garfield had concluded that Johnson was either  crazy or drunk with opium      The conflict between the branches of government was the major issue of the 1866 campaign  with Johnson taking to the campaign trail in a Swing Around the Circle and Garfield facing opposition within his party in his home district  With the South still disenfranchised and Northern public opinion behind them  the Republicans gained a two thirds majority in both houses of Congress  Garfield  having overcome his challengers at his district nominating convention  was easily re elected     Garfield opposed the initial talk of impeaching President Johnson when Congress convened in December 1866    However  he supported legislation to limit Johnson s powers  such as the Tenure of Office Act   which restricted Johnson in removing presidential appointees  Distracted by committee duties  he rarely spoke in connection with these bills  but was a loyal Republican vote against Johnson  Due to a court case  he was absent on the day in April 1868 when the House impeached Johnson   but soon gave a speech aligning himself with Thaddeus Stevens and others who sought Johnson s removal  When the president was acquitted in trial before the Senate  Garfield was shocked  and blamed the outcome of the trial on its presiding officer  Chief Justice Chase  his onetime mentor     By the time Ulysses S  Grant succeeded Johnson in 1869  Garfield had moved away from the remaining radicals  Stevens  their leader  had died in 1868   He hailed the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870 as a triumph  and he favored the re admission of Georgia to the Union as a matter of right  not politics  In 1871  Garfield opposed passage of the Ku Klux Klan Act   saying  I have never been more perplexed by a piece of legislation   He was torn between his indignation at  these terrorists  and his concern for the freedoms endangered by the power the bill gave to the president to enforce the act through suspension of habeas corpus      Throughout his political career  Garfield favored the gold standard and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold  and later  through the free and unlimited coinage of silver     In 1865  Garfield was placed on the House Ways and Means Committee   a long awaited opportunity to focus on financial and economic issues  He reprised his opposition to the greenback  saying   any party which commits itself to paper money will go down amid the general disaster  covered with the curses of a ruined people     In 1868 Garfield gave a two hour speech on currency in the House  which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point  in it he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments  that is  the government paying out silver and gold  rather than paper money that could not be redeemed     Tariffs had been raised to high levels during the Civil War  Afterwards  Garfield  who made a close study of financial affairs  advocated moving towards free trade  though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow  This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867  and though Republicans held the majority in the House until 1875  Garfield remained off that committee during that time  Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee   but it was Ways and Means  with its influence over fiscal policy  that he really wanted to lead    Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor  Horace Greeley      In September 1870  Garfield  who was then chairman of the House Banking Committee   led an investigation into the Black Friday Gold Panic scandal  The committee investigation into corruption was thorough  but found no indictable offenses  Garfield blamed the easy availability of fiat money greenbacks for financing the speculation that led to the scandal     Garfield was not at all enthused about the re election of President Grant in 1872until Horace Greeley  who emerged as the candidate of the Democrats and Liberal Republicans   became the only serious alternative  Garfield opined   I would say Grant was not fit to be nominated and Greeley is not fit to be elected     Both Grant and Garfield won overwhelming re election victories     The Crdit Mobilier of America scandal involved corruption in the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad   part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869  Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crdit Mobilier of America company  then contracted with the firm to have it undertake the construction of the railroad  The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad  using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project  and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value   well below the market rate  Crdit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains  and distributed substantial dividends  The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds  One of the railroad officials that controlled Crdit Mobilier was also a congressman  Oakes Ames of Massachusetts  He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crdit Mobilier stock at par value  well below what it sold for on the market  and the railroad got its additional appropriations     The story broke in July 1872  in the middle of the presidential campaign  Among those named were Vice President  and former House Speaker  Schuyler Colfax   Grant s second term running mate  Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson    Speaker James G  Blaine of Maine  and Garfield  Greeley had little luck taking advantage of the scandal  When Congress reconvened after the election  Blaine  seeking to clear his name  demanded a House investigation  Evidence before the special committee exonerated Blaine  Garfield had stated  in September 1872  that Ames had offered him stock  but he had repeatedly refused it  Testifying before the committee in January  Ames alleged that he had offered Garfield ten shares of stock at par value  but that Garfield had never taken the shares  or paid for them  A year had passed  from 1867 to 1868  before Garfield had finally refused it  Garfield  appearing before the committee on January 14  1873  confirmed much of this  Ames testified several weeks later that Garfield agreed to take the stock on credit  and that it was paid for by the company s huge dividends    The two men differed over a sum of some  300 that Garfield received and later paid back  with Garfield deeming it a loan and Ames a dividend     Garfield s biographers were unwilling to exonerate him in Crdit Mobilier  with Allan Peskin writing  Did Garfield lie  Not exactly  Did he tell the truth  Not completely  Was he corrupted  Not really  Even Garfield s enemies never claimed that his involvement    influenced his behavior     Rutkow wrote that  Garfield s real offense was that he knowingly denied to the House investigating committee that he had agreed to accept the stock and that he had also received a dividend of  329     Caldwell suggested that Garfield  while he told the truth  before the committee   certainly failed to tell the whole truth  clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty     That Crdit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept  even mentioned on the floor of Congress  and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield  in his positions on committees dealing with finance   had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this  than the sentinel has to snore on his post      Another issue that caused Garfield trouble in his 1874 re election bid was the so called   Salary Grab   of 1873  which increased the compensation for members of Congress by 50 percent  retroactive to 1871  Garfield was responsible  as Appropriations Committee chairman  for shepherding the legislative appropriations bill through the House  during the debate in February 1873  Massachusetts Representative Benjamin Butler offered the increase as an amendment  and despite Garfield s opposition  it passed the House and eventually became law  The law was very popular in the House  as almost half the members were lame ducks   but the public was outraged  and many of Garfield s constituents blamed him  though he refused to accept the increase  In what was a bad year for Republicans  who lost control of the House for the first time since the Civil War  Garfield had his closest congressional election  winning with only 57 percent of the vote    d      With the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1875  Garfield lost his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee  The Democratic leadership in the House appointed Garfield as a Republican member of Ways and Means  With many of his leadership rivals defeated in the 1874 Democratic landslide  and Blaine elected to the Senate  Garfield was seen as the Republican floor leader and the likely Speaker should the party regain control of the chamber     As the 1876 presidential election approached  Garfield was loyal to the candidacy of Senator Blaine  and fought for the former Speaker s nomination at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati  When it became clear  after six ballots  that Blaine could not prevail  the convention nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford B  Hayes   Although Garfield had supported Blaine  he had kept good relations with Hayes  and wholeheartedly supported the governor    Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full time to the practice of law  but to help his party  he sought re election  and won it easily that October  Any celebration was short lived  as Garfield s youngest son  Neddie  fell ill with whooping cough shortly after the congressional election  and soon died     When Hayes appeared to have lost the presidential election the following month to Democrat Samuel Tilden   the Republicans launched efforts to reverse the result in Southern states where they held the governorship  South Carolina  Louisiana  and Florida  If Hayes won all three states  he would take the election by a single electoral vote  Grant asked Garfield to serve as a  neutral observer  in the recount in Louisiana  The observers soon recommended to the state electoral commissions that Hayes be declared the winnerGarfield recommended that the entire vote of West Feliciana Parish   which had given Tilden a sizable majority  be thrown out  The Republican governors of the three states certified that Hayes had won their states  to the outrage of Democrats  who had the state legislatures submit rival returns  and threatened to prevent the counting of the electoral voteunder the Constitution  Congress is the final arbiter of the election  Congress then passed a bill establishing the Electoral Commission   to determine the winner  Although he opposed the Commission  feeling that Congress should count the vote and proclaim Hayes victorious  Garfield was appointed to it over the objections of Democrats that he was too partisan  Hayes emerged the victor by a Commission vote of 8 to 7  with all eight votes being cast by Republican politicians or appointees of that party to the Supreme Court  As part of the deal whereby they recognized Hayes as president  Southern Democrats secured the removal of federal troops from the South  ending Reconstruction     Although a Senate seat would be disposed of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary  Hayes needed Garfield s expertise to protect him from the agenda of a hostile Congress  and asked him not to seek it  Garfield  as the president s key legislator  gained considerable prestige and respect from his role    When Congress debated what became the Bland Allison Act   to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins   Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard  but it was enacted over Hayes s veto in February 1878     Garfield during this time purchased the property in Mentor that reporters later dubbed Lawnfield    and from which he would conduct the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency  Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879  seeing that as a road that would likely put Garfield in the White House  Garfield preferred to seek election as senator  and devoted his efforts to seeing that Republicans won the 1879 election for the General Assembly  with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent  Allen G  Thurman   The Republicans swept the legislative elections  Rivals were spoken of for the seat  such as Secretary Sherman  but he had presidential ambitions  for which he sought Garfield s support   and other candidates fell by the wayside  Garfield was elected to the Senate by the General Assembly in January 1880  though his term was not to begin until March 4  1881     Garfield was one of three attorneys who argued for the petitioners in the landmark Supreme Court case Ex parte Milligan in 1866  The petitioners were pro Confederate northern men who had been found guilty and sentenced to death by a military court for treasonous activities  The case turned on whether the defendants should instead have been tried by a civilian court  and resulted in a ruling that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals while the civil courts were operating  The oral argument was Garfield s first court appearance  Jeremiah Black had taken him in as a junior partner a year before  and assigned the case to him in light of his highly regarded oratory skills  With the result  Garfield instantly achieved a reputation as a preeminent appellate lawyer     During Grant s first term  discontented with public service  Garfield pursued opportunities in the law  but declined a partnership offer when told his prospective partner was of  intemperate and licentious  reputation    In 1873  after the death of Chase  Garfield appealed to Grant to appoint Justice Noah H  Swayne as Chief Justice  Grant  however  appointed Morrison R  Waite      Garfield thought the land grants given to expanding railroads to be an unjust practice  as well  he opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations  as well as the power sought by the workers  unions    Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers  He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers  in exchange for their positions  were forced to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions     In 1876  Garfield displayed his mathematical talent when he developed a trapezoid proof of the Pythagorean theorem   His finding was placed in the New England Journal of Education   Mathematics historian William Dunham stated that Garfield s trapezoid work was  really a very clever proof      Having just been elected to the Senate with Sherman s support  Garfield entered the 1880 campaign season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee    Even before the convention began  however  a few Republicans  including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia  thought Garfield the best choice for the nomination    Garfield denied any interest in the position  but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant s ambitions    Besides Sherman  the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant  but several other candidates attracted delegates as well     As the convention began  Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York  the floor leader for the Grant forces  known as the Stalwart faction   proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election    When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound  Conkling sought to expel them from the convention  Garfield rose to defend the men  giving a passionate speech in defense of their right to reserve judgement    The crowd turned against Conkling  and he withdrew the motion    The performance delighted Garfield s boosters  who now believed more than ever that he was the only man who could attract a majority of the delegates  votes     After speeches in favor of the other front runners  Garfield rose to place Sherman s name in nomination  his nominating speech was well received  but the delegates mustered little excitement for the idea of Sherman as the next president    The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284  Sherman s 93 placed him in a distant third  Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces  with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination    Jeremiah McLain Rusk   a member of the Wisconsin delegation  and Benjamin Harrison   an Indiana delegate  sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti Grant votes to a dark horse candidateGarfield    Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot  and the stampede began  Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman  but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him    In the next round of voting  nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield  giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination  Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end  creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party    To obtain that faction s support for the ticket  former New York customs collector Chester A  Arthur   a member of Conkling s political machine   was chosen as the vice presidential nominee and Garfield s running mate     Despite including a Stalwart on the ticket  animosity between the Republican factions carried over from the convention  and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there    After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign  Garfield returned to Ohio  leaving the active campaigning to others  as was traditional at the time    Meanwhile  the Democrats settled on their nominee  Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania  a career military officer    Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South   while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans  most of the campaign would involve a few close states  including New York and Indiana     Practical differences between the candidates were few  and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt   reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war  and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war  dishonor Union veterans  and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury    With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war  and Union generals at the head of both tickets  the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters    With a few months to go before the election  the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the tariff   Seizing on the Democratic platform s call for a  tariff for revenue only   Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs    Hancock made the situation worse when  attempting to strike a moderate stance  he said  the tariff question is a local question     The ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield    In the end  fewer than ten thousand votes separated the two candidates  but in the Electoral College   Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock  214 to 155     Between his election and his inauguration  Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling s and Blaine s warring factions  Blaine s delegates had provided much of the support for Garfield s nomination  and the Maine senator received the place of honor  Secretary of State    Blaine was not only the president s closest advisor  he was obsessed with knowing all that took place in the White House  and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence    Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury  William H  Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy  Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War  and Samuel J  Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior  New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General  Garfield appointed Pennsylvania s Wayne MacVeagh   an adversary of Blaine s  as Attorney General     Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh  William E  Chandler   as Solicitor General under MacVeagh  Only Chandler s rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh s resignation over the matter     Distracted by cabinet maneuvering  Garfield s inaugural address was not up to his typical oratorical standards    In one high point  Garfield emphasized the civil rights of African Americans   saying  Freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen     After discussing the gold standard  the need for education  and an unexpected denunciation of Mormon polygamy  the speech ended  The crowd applauded  but the speech  according to Peskin   however sincerely intended  betrayed its hasty composition by the flatness of its tone and the conventionality of its subject matter      Garfield s appointment of James infuriated Conkling  a factional opponent of the Postmaster General  who demanded a compensatory appointment for his faction  such as the position of Secretary of the Treasury  The resulting squabble occupied much of Garfield s brief presidency  The feud with Conkling reached a climax when the president  at Blaine s instigation  nominated Conkling s enemy  Judge William H  Robertson   to be Collector of the Port of New York  This was one of the prize patronage positions below cabinet level  and was then held by Edwin A  Merritt   Conkling raised the time honored principle of senatorial courtesy in an attempt to defeat the nomination  to no avail  Garfield  who believed the practice to be corrupt  would not back down and threatened to withdraw all nominations unless Robertson was confirmed  intending to  settle the question whether the President is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States     Ultimately  Conkling and his New York colleague  Senator Thomas C  Platt   resigned their Senate seats to seek vindication  but found only further humiliation when the New York legislature elected others in their places  Robertson was confirmed as Collector and Garfield s victory was clear  To Blaine s chagrin  the victorious Garfield returned to his goal of balancing the interests of party factions  and nominated a number of Conkling s Stalwart friends to offices     Grant and Hayes had both advocated civil service reform  and by 1881  civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation  Garfield sympathized with them  believing that the spoils system damaged the presidency and distracted from more important concerns    Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends  but many remained loyal and supported Garfield     Corruption in the post office also cried out for reform  In April 1880  there had been a congressional investigation into corruption in the Post Office Department   in which profiteering rings allegedly stole millions of dollars  securing bogus mail contracts on star routes     After obtaining contracts with the lowest bid  costs to run the mail routes would be escalated and profits would be divided among ring members  That year  Hayes stopped the implementation of any new star route contracts  Shortly after taking office  Garfield received information from Attorney General MacVeagh and Postmaster General James of postal corruption by an alleged star route ringleader  Second Assistant Postmaster General Thomas J  Brady     Garfield demanded Brady s resignation and ordered prosecutions that would end in trials for conspiracy  When told that his party  including his own campaign manager  Stephen W  Dorsey   was involved  Garfield directed MacVeagh and James to root out the corruption in the Post Office Department  to the bone   regardless of where it might lead    Brady resigned and was eventually indicted for conspiracy  After two  star route  ring trials in 1882 and 1883  the jury found Brady not guilty     Garfield believed that the key to improving the state of African American civil rights would be found in education aided by the federal government    During Reconstruction  freedmen had gained citizenship and suffrage that enabled them to participate in government  but Garfield believed their rights were being eroded by Southern white resistance and illiteracy  and was concerned that blacks would become America s permanent   peasantry      His answer was to propose a  universal  education system funded by the federal government  Congress and the northern white public  however  had lost interest in African American rights  and federal funding for universal education did not find support in Congress during Garfield s term    Garfield also worked to appoint several African Americans to prominent positions  Frederick Douglass   recorder of deeds in Washington  Robert Elliot   special agent to the Treasury  John M  Langston   Haitian minister  and Blanche K  Bruce   register to the Treasury  Garfield believed that Southern support for the Republican party could be gained by  commercial and industrial  interests rather than race issues and began to reverse Hayes s policy of conciliating Southern Democrats    He appointed William H  Hunt   a carpetbagger Republican from Louisiana  as Secretary of the Navy    To break the hold of the resurgent Democratic Party in the Solid South  Garfield took patronage advice from Virginia Senator William Mahone of the biracial independent Readjuster Party   hoping to add the independents  strength to the Republicans  there     Entering the presidency  Garfield had little foreign policy experience  so he leaned heavily on Blaine  Blaine  a former protectionist   now agreed with Garfield on the need to promote freer trade  especially within the Western Hemisphere     Their reasons were twofold  firstly  Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with Latin America would be the best way to keep Great Britain from dominating the region    Secondly  by encouraging exports  they believed they could increase American prosperity  and by doing so position the Republican party as the author of that prosperity  ensuring continued electoral success    Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade    At the same time  they hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia   Chile   and Peru     Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory  but Chile  which had by 1881 occupied the Peruvian capital  Lima   rejected any settlement that restored the previous status quo     Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas  calling for renegotiation of the Clayton Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement  as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii     Garfield s and Blaine s plans for the United States  involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere  as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar     Garfield also considered enhancing the United States  military strength abroad  asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization    In the end  these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated  Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan American conference  but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur  Garfield s successor  cancelled the conference      e   Naval reform continued under Arthur  if on a more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned  ultimately ending in the construction of the Squadron of Evolution      Charles J  Guiteau had followed various professions in his life  but in 1880 had determined to gain federal office by supporting what he expected to be the winning Republican ticket    He composed a speech   Garfield vs  Hancock   and got it printed by the Republican National Committee  One means of persuading the voter in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate s merits  but with the Republicans seeking more famous men  Guiteau received few opportunities to speak    On one occasion  according to Kenneth D  Ackerman in his book about Garfield s candidacy and assassination  Guiteau was unable to finish his speech due to nerves  Guiteau  who considered himself a Stalwart  deemed his contribution to Garfield s victory sufficient to justify the position of consul in Paris  despite the fact he spoke no French  nor any foreign language     One of President Garfield s more wearying duties was seeing office seekers  and he saw Guiteau at least once  White House officials suggested that Guiteau approach Blaine  as the consulship was within the Department of State    Blaine also saw the public regularly  and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions  Blaine  who had no intention of giving Guiteau a position he was not qualified for and had not earned  simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson s nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship  which required Senate confirmation    Once the New York senators had resigned  and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector  Guiteau pressed his claim  and Blaine told him he would not receive the position     Guiteau came to believe he had lost the position because he was a Stalwart  The office seeker decided that the only way to end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to diethough he had nothing personal against the president  Arthur s succession would restore peace  he felt  and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts  including Guiteau     The assassination of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke due to the Civil War  and Garfield  like most people  saw no reason why the president should be guarded  Garfield s movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers  Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for cooler climes on July 2  and made plans to kill him before then  He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum  and followed Garfield several times  but each time his plans were frustrated  or he lost his nerve    His opportunities dwindled to oneGarfield s departure by train for Massachusetts on the morning of July 2  1881     Guiteau concealed himself by the ladies  waiting room at the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad   from where Garfield was scheduled to depart  Most of Garfield s cabinet planned to accompany him at least part of the way  Blaine  who was to remain in Washington  came to the station to see him off  The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice  once in the back and once in the arm  The time was 9 30 am  The assassin attempted to leave the station  but was quickly captured    As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield  the assassin s motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting  causing rage against that faction     Garfield was hit by two shots  one glanced off his arm while the other pierced his back  shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen   My God  what is this   he exclaimed    Guiteau  as he was led away  stated   I did it  I will go to jail for it  I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be President     f      Among those at the station was Robert Todd Lincoln   who sixteen years before had watched his father die from an assassin s bullet  Garfield was taken on a mattress upstairs to a private office  where several doctors examined him  probing the wound with unwashed fingers  At his request  Garfield was taken back to the White House  and his wife  then in New Jersey  was sent for    Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City  who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau s statements     Although Joseph Lister  s pioneering work in antisepsis was known to American doctors  Lister himself had visited America in 1876   few of them had confidence in it  and none of his advocates were among Garfield s treating physicians    The physician who took charge at the depot and then at the White House was Doctor Willard Bliss     g   A noted physician and surgeon  Bliss was an old friend of Garfield  and about a dozen doctors  led by Bliss  were soon probing the wound with unsterilized fingers and instruments  Garfield was given morphine for the pain  and asked Bliss to frankly tell him his chances  which Bliss put at one in a hundred   Well  Doctor  we ll take that chance      Over the next few days  Garfield made some improvement  as the nation viewed the news from the capital and prayed  Although he never stood again  he was able to sit up and write several times  and his recovery was viewed so positively that a steamer was fitted out as a seagoing hospital to aid with his convalescence  He was nourished on oatmeal  which he detested  and milk from a cow on the White House lawn  When told that Indian chief Sitting Bull   a prisoner of the army  was starving  Garfield said   Let him starve   then   Oh no  send him my oatmeal     Alexander Graham Bell tried to locate the bullet with a primitive metal detector  he was not successful  One means of keeping the president comfortable in Washington s summer heat was one of the first successful air conditioning units  air propelled by fans over ice and then dried reduced the temperature in the sickroom by 20 degrees Fahrenheit  11 degrees Celsius      Beginning on July 23  Garfield took a turn for the worse  His temperature increased to 104F  40C   doctors  concerned by a pus sac that had developed by the wound  operated and inserted a drainage tube  This initially seemed to help  and Garfield  in his bed  was able to hold a brief cabinet meeting on July 29  though members were under orders from Bliss to discuss nothing that might excite Garfield    Doctors probed the sac  which went into Garfield s body  hoping to find the bullet  they most likely only made the infections worse  Garfield performed only one state act in August  signing an extradition paper  By the end of the month  the president was much more feeble than he had been  and his weight had decreased to 130 pounds  59kg      Garfield had long been anxious to escape hot  unhealthy Washington  and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon  where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer  He left the White House for the last time on September 5  traveling in a specially cushioned railway car  a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage  a seaside mansion given over to his use  was built in a night by volunteers  There  Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became  after an initial rally  a death watch  Garfield s personal secretary  Joe Stanley Brown   wrote 40 years later   to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore  the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside  without recalling again that ghastly tragedy      On September 18  Garfield asked A F  Rockwell  a friend  if he would have a place in history  Rockwell assured him he would  and told Garfield he had much work still before him   No  my work is done     The following day  Garfield  by then also suffering from pneumonia and heart pains  marveled that he could not pick up a glass despite feeling well  and went to sleep without discomfort  He awoke that evening around 10 15 pm with great pain in his chest  The attendant watching him sent for Bliss  who found him unconscious  Despite efforts to revive him  Garfield never awoke  dying at 10 35 pm that evening     According to some historians and medical experts Garfield might have survived his wounds  had the doctors attending him had at their disposal today s medical research  techniques  and equipment    Standard medical practice at the time dictated that priority be given to locating the path of the bullet  Several of his doctors inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet  a common practice in the 1880s    Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield s demise    Biographer Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield s death  the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation    Rutkow  a professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey   has argued that starvation also played a role  Rutkow suggests that  Garfield had such a nonlethal wound  In today s world  he would have gone home in a matter of two or three days      Guiteau was indicted on October 14  1881  for the murder of the president  In a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often interrupted and argued  and in which his counsel used the insanity defense   the jury found him guilty on January 5  1882  and he was sentenced to death  Guiteau may have had syphilis   a disease that causes physiological mental impairment    He was executed on June 30  1882     Garfield s funeral train left Long Branch on the same special track that brought him there  traveling over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags  His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial    More than 70 000 citizens  some waiting over three hours  passed by Garfield s coffin as his body lay in state in Washington  later  on September 25  1881  in Cleveland  more than 150 000a number equal to the entire population of that citylikewise paid their respects    His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland s Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built     Memorials to Garfield were erected across the country  On April 10  1882  seven months after Garfield s death  the U S  Post Office issued a postage stamp in his honor  the second stamp issued by the U S  to honor an assassinated president    In 1884  sculptor Frank Happersberger completed a monument on the grounds of the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers     In 1887  the James A  Garfield Monument was dedicated in Washington    Another monument   in Philadelphia s Fairmount Park   was erected in 1896    In Victoria  Australia   Cannibal Creek was renamed Garfield in his honor     On May 19  1890  Garfield s body was permanently interred  with great solemnity and fanfare  in a mausoleum in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland  Attending the dedication ceremonies were former president Hayes  President Benjamin Harrison  and future president William McKinley     Garfield s Treasury Secretary  William Windom  also attended    Harrison said that Garfield was always a  student and instructor  and that his life works and death would  continue to be instructive and inspiring incidents in American history     Three panels on the monument display Garfield as a teacher  Union major general  and orator   another shows him taking the Presidential oath  and a fifth shows his body lying in state at the Capitol rotunda in Washington D C     Garfield s murder by a deranged office seeker awakened public awareness of the need for civil service reform legislation  Senator George H  Pendleton   a Democrat from Ohio  launched a reform effort that resulted in the Pendleton Act in January 1883    This act reversed the  spoils system  where office seekers paid up or gave political service in order to obtain or keep federally appointed positions    Under the act  appointments were awarded on merit and competitive examination    To ensure the reform was implemented  Congress and Arthur established and funded the Civil Service Commission   The Pendleton Act  however  only covered 10  of federal government workers    For Arthur  previously known for having been a  veteran spoilsman   civil service reform became his most noteworthy achievement     For a few years after his assassination  Garfield s life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story  that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States  Peskin noted that  in mourning Garfield  Americans were not only honoring a president  they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations     As the rivalry between Stalwarts and Half Breeds faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after  so too did memories of Garfield  In the 1890s  Americans became disillusioned with politicians  and looked elsewhere for inspiration  focusing on industrialists  labor leaders  scientists  and others as their heroes  Increasingly  Garfield s short time as president was forgotten     The 20th century saw no revival for Garfield  Thomas Wolfe deemed the presidents of the Gilded Age   including Garfield   lost Americans  whose  gravely vacant and bewhiskered faces mixed  melted  swam together     The politicians of the Gilded Age faded from the public eye  their luster eclipsed by those who had influenced America outside of political office during that time  the robber barons   the inventors  those who had sought social reform  and others who had lived as America rapidly changed  Current events and more recent figures occupied America s attention  according to Ackerman   the busy Twentieth Century has made Garfield s era seem remote and irrelevant  its leaders ridiculed for their very obscurity      Garfield s biographers  and those who have studied his presidency  tend to think well of him  and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end  Historian Justus D  Doenecke  while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma  chronicles his achievements   by winning a victory over the Stalwarts  he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office  As a man  he was intelligent  sensitive  and alert  and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched     Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield s dismissal of Merritt in Robertson s favor  and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter s confirmation    According to Caldwell  writing in 1931   If Garfield lives in history  it will be partly on account of the charm of his personalitybut also because in life and in death  he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation  Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more     Rutkow writes   James Abram Garfield s presidency is reduced to a tantalizing  what if         Peskin believes Garfield deserves more credit for his political career than he has received   True  his accomplishments were neither bold nor heroic  but his was not an age that called for heroism  His stormy presidency was brief and  and in some respects  unfortunate  but he did leave the office stronger than he found it  As a public man he had a hand in almost every issue of national importance for almost two decades  while as a party leader he  along with Blaine  forged the Republican Party into the instrument that would lead the United States into the twentieth century     Books  Periodicals  Online ", "Reagan": "Early life Entertainment career Radio and film Military

and actor  who served as the 40th President of the United States from 1981 to 1989  Prior to his presidency  he served as the 33rd Governor of California from 1967 to 1975  following a career as an

regional radio stations  Moving to Hollywood in 1937  he became an actor  starring in a few major productions  Reagan was twice elected as President of the Screen Actors Guild   the labor union for actors  where he worked to root out Communist influence   In the 1950s he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories  Having been a lifelong liberal Democrat   his views changed  He became a conservative and in 1962 switched to the Republican Party   In 1964   Reagan s speech    A Time for Choosing    in support of Barry Goldwater  s floundering presidential campaign  earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman  Building a network of supporters  he was elected Governor of California in 1966   As governor  Reagan raised taxes  turned a state budget deficit to a surplus  challenged the protesters at the University of California  ordered National Guard troops in during a period of protest movements in 1969  and was re elected in 1970   He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nominations in 1968 and 1976   four years later  he easily won the nomination outright  going on to be elected the oldest President  defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980    Entering the presidency in 1981   Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives  His supply side economic policies  dubbed   Reaganomics    advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth  control of the money supply to curb inflation  economic deregulation  and reduction in government spending  In his first term he survived an assassination attempt   escalated the War on Drugs   and fought public sector labor   Over his two terms  his economic policies saw a reduction of inflation from 12 5  to 4 4   and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3 44   while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending  increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall  even after adjustment for inflation  During his reelection bid  Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was   Morning in America    winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in history  Foreign affairs dominated his second term  including ending of the Cold War   the bombing of Libya   and the IranContra affair   Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an   evil empire    he transitioned Cold War policy from dtente to rollback   by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev   which culminated in the INF Treaty   shrinking both countries  nuclear arsenals    During his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate   President Reagan challenged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to   tear down this wall    Months after the end of his term  the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed soon thereafter   Leaving office in 1989  Reagan held an approval rating of sixty eight percent  matching those of Franklin D  Roosevelt   and later Bill Clinton   as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era    While having planned an active post presidency  in 1994 Reagan disclosed his diagnosis with Alzheimer s disease earlier that year  appearing publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon   he died ten years later at the age of 93  An icon among Republicans  he ranks favorably in public and critical opinion of U S  Presidents   and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States     Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in an apartment on the second floor of a commercial building in Tampico  Illinois on February 6  1911  the son of Nelle Clyde  Wilson  and John Edward  Jack  Reagan     Reagan s father was a salesman and a storyteller  the grandson of Irish Catholic immigrants from County Tipperary     while his mother was of half Scots and half English descent  Reagan s maternal grandmother was born in Surrey   England     Reagan had one older brother  Neil  190896   who became an advertising executive    As a boy  Reagan s father nicknamed his son  Dutch   due to his   fat little Dutchman   like appearance  and his  Dutchboy  haircut    the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth    Reagan s family briefly lived in several towns and cities in Illinois  including Monmouth   Galesburg   and Chicago    in 1919  they returned to Tampico and lived above the H C  Pitney Variety Store until finally settling in Dixon     After his election as president  residing in the upstairs White House private quarters  Reagan would quip that he was  living above the store again      According to Paul Kengor   author of God and Ronald Reagan   Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people  which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother  Nelle    and the Disciples of Christ faith    which he was baptized into in 1922    For the time  Reagan was unusual in his opposition to racial discrimination  and recalled a time in Dixon when the local inn would not allow black people to stay there  Reagan brought them back to his house  where his mother invited them to stay the night and have breakfast the next morning     After the closure of the Pitney Store in late 1920  the Reagans moved to Dixon    the midwestern  small universe  had a lasting impression on Reagan    He attended Dixon High School   where he developed interests in acting  sports  and storytelling    His first job was as a lifeguard at the Rock River in Lowell Park  near Dixon  in 1927  Over a six year period  Reagan reportedly performed 77 rescues as a lifeguard    Reagan attended Eureka College   a Disciples oriented liberal arts school  where he became a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity  a cheerleader  and studied economics and sociology  While involved  the Miller Center of Public Affairs described him as an  indifferent student   He majored in Economics and graduated with a C average    He developed a reputation as a jack of all trades  excelling in campus politics  sports and theater  He was a member of the football team and captain of the swim team  He was elected student body president and led a student revolt against the college president after he tried to cut back the faculty     After graduating from Eureka in 1932  Reagan drove himself to Iowa  where he held jobs as an announcer at several stations  He moved to WHO radio in Des Moines as an announcer for Chicago Cubs baseball games  His specialty was creating play by play accounts of games using as his source only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress     While traveling with the Cubs in California  Reagan took a screen test in 1937 that led to a seven year contract with Warner Brothers studios    He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the   B film   unit  where  Reagan joked  the producers  didn t want them good  they wanted them Thursday      His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movie Love Is on the Air   and by the end of 1939 he had already appeared in 19 films    including Dark Victory with Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart   Before the film Santa Fe Trail with Errol Flynn in 1940  he played the role of George  The Gipper  Gipp in the film Knute Rockne  All American   from it  he acquired the lifelong nickname  the Gipper     In 1941 exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood     Reagan s favorite acting role was as a double amputee in 1942 s Kings Row     in which he recites the line   Where s the rest of me    later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography  Many film critics considered Kings Row to be his best movie    though the film was condemned by New York Times critic Bosley Crowther        Although Reagan called Kings Row the film that  made me a star     he was unable to capitalize on his success because he was ordered to active duty with the U S  Army at San Francisco two months after its release  and never regained  star  status in motion pictures    In the post war era  after being separated from almost four years of World War II stateside service with the 1st Motion Picture Unit in December 1945  Reagan co starred in such films as  The Voice of the Turtle   John Loves Mary   The Hasty Heart   Bedtime for Bonzo   Cattle Queen of Montana   Tennessee s Partner   Hellcats of the Navy  the only film in which he appears with Nancy Reagan  and the 1964 remake The Killers  his final film and the only one in which he played a villain     Throughout his film career  his mother answered much of his fan mail     After completing fourteen home study Army Extension Courses  Reagan enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps of the cavalry on May 25  1937     Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time on April 18  1942  Due to his poor eyesight  he was classified for limited service only  which excluded him from serving overseas    His first assignment was at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation at Fort Mason   California  as a liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office    Upon the approval of the Army Air Force  AAF   he applied for a transfer from the cavalry to the AAF on May 15  1942  and was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the First Motion Picture Unit  officially  the  18th Army Air Force Base Unit   in Culver City  California     On January 14  1943  he was promoted to first lieutenant and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of This Is The Army at Burbank  California     He returned to the First Motion Picture Unit after completing this duty and was promoted to captain on July 22  1943     In January 1944  Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the opening of the Sixth War Loan Drive   He was reassigned to the First Motion Picture Unit on November 14  1944  where he remained until the end of World War II    He was recommended for promotion to major on February 2  1945  but this recommendation was disapproved on July 17 of that year    While with the First Motion Picture Unit in 1945  he was indirectly involved in discovering actress Marilyn Monroe     He returned to Fort MacArthur   California  where he was separated from active duty on December 9  1945    By the end of the war  his units had produced some 400 training films for the AAF     Reagan never left the United States during the war  though he kept a film reel  obtained while in the service  depicting the liberation of Auschwitz  as he believed that someday doubts would arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred    It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz      though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George Shultz      Reagan was first elected to the Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild in 1941  serving as an alternate  After World War II  he resumed service and became 3rd vice president in 1946    The adoption of conflict of interest bylaws in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign  Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and subsequently elected    He was subsequently chosen by the membership to serve seven additional one year terms  from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959    Reagan led SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor management disputes  the Taft Hartley Act   House Committee on Un American Activities  HUAC  hearings and the Hollywood blacklist era     During the late 1940s  Reagan and his wife provided the FBI with names of actors within the motion picture industry whom they believed to be communist sympathizers   though he expressed reservations  he said  Do they expect us to constitute ourselves as a little FBI of our own and determine just who is a Commie and who isn t       Reagan testified before the House Un American Activities Committee on the subject as well    A fervent anti communist   he reaffirmed his commitment to democratic principles  stating   I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged  by either fear or resentment of this group  that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment      Though an early critic of television  Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and decided to join the medium    He was hired as the host of General Electric Theater   a series of weekly dramas that became very popular    His contract required him to tour GE plants sixteen weeks out of the year  often demanding of him fourteen speeches per day    He earned approximately  125 000 per year  about  1 07million in 2010 dollars  in this role  His final work as a professional actor was as host and performer from 1964 to 1965 on the television series Death Valley Days     Reagan and Nancy Davis appeared together several times  including an episode of General Electric Theater in 1958 called  A Turkey for the President      In 1938  Reagan co starred in the film Brother Rat with actress Jane Wyman  19172007   They were engaged at the Chicago Theatre     and married on January 26  1940  at the Wee Kirk o  the Heather church in Glendale   California    Together they had two biological children  Maureen  19412001  and Christine  who was born in 1947 but only lived one day   and adopted a third  Michael  born 1945     After arguments about Reagan s political ambitions  Wyman filed for divorce in 1948    citing a distraction due to her husband s Screen Actors Guild union duties  the divorce was finalized in 1949    He is the only US president to have been divorced    Reagan and Wyman continued to be friends until his death  with Wyman voting for Reagan in both of his runs and  upon his death  saying  America has lost a great president and a great  kind  and gentle man      Reagan met actress Nancy Davis  born 1921    in 1949 after she contacted him in his capacity as president of the Screen Actors Guild to help her with issues regarding her name appearing on a Communist blacklist in Hollywood  She had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis  She described their meeting by saying   I don t know if it was exactly love at first sight  but it was pretty close     They were engaged at Chasen s restaurant in Los Angeles and were married on March 4  1952  at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley     Actor William Holden served as best man at the ceremony  They had two children  Patti  born October 21  1952  and Ron  born May 20  1958    Observers described the Reagans  relationship as close  authentic and intimate    During his presidency they were reported to frequently display their affection for one another  one press secretary said   They never took each other for granted  They never stopped courting       He often called her  Mommy  and she called him  Ronnie     He once wrote to her   Whatever I treasure and enjoy    all would be without meaning if I didn t have you     When he was in the hospital in 1981  she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent    In a letter to U S  citizens written in 1994  Reagan wrote  I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer s disease      I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience     and in 1998  while Reagan was stricken by Alzheimer s  Nancy told Vanity Fair    Our relationship is very special  We were very much in love and still are  When I say my life began with Ronnie  well  it s true  It did  I can t imagine life without him      Reagan began his political career as a Democrat   He joined numerous political committees with a left wing orientation  such as the American Veterans Committee  He fought against Republican sponsored right to work legislation and for Helen Gahagan Douglas in 1950  when she was defeated for the Senate by Richard Nixon   It was his realization that Communists were a powerful backstage influence in those groups  that led him to rally his friends against them     Reagan spoke frequently at rallies with a strong ideological dimension  in December 1945  he was stopped from leading an anti nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the Warner Bros  studio  He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency  specifically his opposition to mutually assured destruction   building on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to a new focus to reduce the numbers and types of them    In the 1948 election  Reagan strongly supported Harry S  Truman   appearing on stage with him during a campaign speech in Los Angeles    However  in the early 1950s  as his relationship with actress Nancy Davis grew    he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies of Dwight D  Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as Richard Nixon in 1960     He was hired by General Electric in 1954 to host the General Electric Theater   a weekly TV drama series  Much more important  he crisscrossed the country giving talks to over 200 000 GE employees as a motivational speaker His many speecheswhich he wrote himselfwere non partisan but carried a conservative  pro business message  he was influenced by Lemuel Boulware   a senior GE executive  Boulware  known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers  championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism  free markets  anticommunism  lower taxes  and limited government    Eager for a larger stage  but not allowed to enter politics by GE  he quit and formally registered as a Republican    He often said  I didn t leave the Democratic Party  The party left me      When legislation that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961  Reagan created a recording for the American Medical Association warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America  Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it   we will awake to find that we have socialism  And if you don t do this  and if I don t do it  one of these days  you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children  and our children s children  what it once was like in America when men were free       He also joined the National Rifle Association and would become a lifetime member     Reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contender Barry Goldwater in 1964    Speaking for Goldwater  Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government  Consolidating themes he had developed in talks for GE  he argued in  A Time for Choosing   October 27  1964    This   A Time for Choosing   speech was not enough to turn around the faltering Goldwater campaign  but it was the key event that established Reagan s national political visibility       California Republicans were impressed with Reagan s political views and charisma after his  Time for Choosing  speech    he announced in late 1965  his campaign for Governor of California in 1966      He defeated former San Francisco mayor George Christopher in the GOP primary  In Reagan s campaign  he emphasized two main themes   to send the welfare bums back to work   and  in reference to burgeoning anti war and anti establishment student protests at the University of California at Berkeley    to clean up the mess at Berkeley     Ronald Reagan accomplished in 1966 what US Senator William F  Knowland in 1958 and former Vice President Richard M  Nixon in 1962 had tried  he was elected  defeating two term governor Edmund G   Pat  Brown   and was sworn in on January 2  1967  In his first term  he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget     Shortly after the beginning of his term  Reagan tested the presidential waters in 1968 as part of a  Stop Nixon  movement  hoping to cut into Nixon s Southern support   and be a compromise candidate   if neither Nixon nor second place Nelson Rockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the Republican convention   However  by the time of the convention Nixon had 692 delegate votes  25 more than he needed to secure the nomination  followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place     Reagan was involved in high profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era  On May 15  1969  during the People s Park protests at UC Berkeley  Reagan sent the California Highway Patrol and other officers to quell the protests  in an incident that became known as  Bloody Thursday   resulting in the death of student James Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard      Reagan then called out 2 200 state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters    A year after  Bloody Thursday   Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying   If it takes a bloodbath  let s get it over with  No more appeasement     When the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped Patty Hearst in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor  Reagan joked to a group of political aides about a botulism outbreak contaminating the food    Conversely  in that one afternoon   Bloody Thursday   111 police officers were injured  including one C H P  officer who was knifed in the chest  After calling in the National Guard  the Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days  camping in People s Park  and demonstrations subsided as the University removed cordoned off fencing and placed all development plans for People s Park on hold       Early in 1967  the national debate on abortion was beginning  Democratic California state senator Anthony Beilenson introduced the  Therapeutic Abortion Act   in an effort to reduce the number of  back room abortions  performed in California    The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan s desk where  after many days of indecision  he signed it    About two million abortions would be performed as a result  most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well being of the mother    Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill  and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor  he would not have signed it  After he recognized what he called the  consequences  of the bill  he announced that he was pro life     He maintained that position later in his political career  writing extensively about abortion     In 1967  Reagan signed the Mulford Act   which became California penal code 12031 and 171 c    The bill repealed a law allowing public carrying of loaded firearms  Named after Republican assemblyman Don Mulford   the bill garnered national attention after the Black Panthers marched bearing arms upon the California State Capitol to protest the bill       Despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968    Reagan was re elected in 1970  defeating  Big Daddy  Jesse Unruh   He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle  One of Reagan s greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment  which he strongly supported    His efforts to enforce the state s laws in this area were thwarted when the Supreme Court of California issued its People v  Anderson decision  which invalidated all death sentences issued in California before 1972  though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment  The only execution during Reagan s governorship was on April 12  1967  when Aaron Mitchell  s sentence was carried out by the state in San Quentin  s gas chamber     In 1969  Reagan  as Governor  signed the Family Law Act   an amalgam of two bills which had been written and revised by the California state legislature for over two years   and became the first no fault divorce legislation in the United States     Reagan s terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president  By campaigning on a platform of sending  the welfare bums back to work   he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state  He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy  including that of undue federal taxation     Reagan did not seek re election to a third term as governor in 1974 and was succeeded by Democratic California Secretary of State Jerry Brown on January 6  1975   In 1976  Reagan challenged incumbent President Gerald Ford in a bid to become the Republican Party s candidate for president  Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like minded organizations such as the American Conservative Union which became key components of his political base  while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican     Reagan s campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford s likely nomination  Reagan won North Carolina  Texas  and California  but the strategy failed  as   he ended up losing New Hampshire  Florida  and his native Illinois    The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan  when he swept all ninety six delegates chosen in the May 1 primary  with four more awaiting at the state convention  Much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co chairmen  including Ernest Angelo   the mayor of Midland   and Ray Barnhart of Houston   whom President Reagan would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration      However  as the GOP convention neared  Ford appeared close to victory  Acknowledging his party s moderate wing  Reagan chose moderate Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate if nominated  Nonetheless  Ford prevailed with 1 187 delegates to Reagan s 1 070    Ford would go on to lose the 1976 Presidential election to the Democrat Jimmy Carter    Reagan s concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union  Though he lost the nomination  he received 307 write in votes in New Hampshire  388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming s ballot  and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington    which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter    After the campaign  Reagan remained in the public debate with the Ronald Reagan Radio Commentary series   and his political action committee  Citizens for the Republic   which was later revived in Alexandria   Virginia in 2009 by the Reagan biographer Craig Shirley      The 1980 presidential campaign between Reagan and incumbent President Jimmy Carter was conducted during domestic concerns and the ongoing Iran hostage crisis   His campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles  lower taxes to stimulate the economy    less government interference in people s lives    states  rights     and a strong national defense     Reagan launched his campaign by declaring  I believe in states  rights   After receiving the Republican nomination  Reagan selected one of his primary opponents  George H W  Bush   to be his running mate  His showing in the October televised debate boosted his campaign  Reagan won the election  carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter  representing six states and Washington  D C    Reagan received 50 7  of the popular vote while Carter took 41   and Independent John B  Anderson  a liberal Republican  received 6 7     Republicans captured the Senate for the first time since 1952  and gained 34 House seats   but the Democrats retained a majority   During his presidency  Reagan pursued policies that reflected his personal belief in individual freedom  brought changes domestically  both to the U S  economy and expanded military  and contributed to the end of the Cold War     Termed the Reagan Revolution   his presidency would reinvigorate American morale      reinvigorate the American economy and reduce American reliance upon government    As president  Reagan kept a diary in which he commented on daily occurrences of his presidency and his views on the issues of the day  The diaries were published in May 2007 in the bestselling book  The Reagan Diaries      To date  Reagan is the oldest person elected to the office of the presidency  at 69  and the oldest president at the time of inauguration  at 69 years  341 days   In his first inaugural address on January 20  1981  which Reagan himself wrote  he addressed the country s economic malaise arguing   In this present crisis  government is not the solution to our problems  government is the problem      In 1981  Reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer  The school prayer had previously been banned by the supreme court in 1962   and Reagan s election reflected an opposition to the courts decision    Reagan s 1981 proposed amendment stated   Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public institutions  No person shall be required by the United States or by any state to participate in prayer   In a message to Congress  Reagan said that his proposed amendment would  restore the simple freedom of our citizens to offer prayer in public schools and institutions     In a nationally televised speech the following day  Rabbi Menachem M  Schneerson lauded Reagan s speech and said the moment of silence would  ensure that children grow up to be decent and upright     In 1984  Reagan again raised the issue  asking Congress  why can t  the  freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land     In 1985  Reagan expressed his disappointment that the Supreme Court ruling still bans a moment of silence for public school  and said he had  an uphill battle     In 1987 Reagan again renewed his call for Congress to support voluntary prayer in schools and end  the expulsion of God from America s classrooms     During his term in office  Reagan campaigned vigorously to restore prayer to the schools  first as a moment of prayer and later as a Moment of Silence     On March 30  1981  only 69 days into the new administration  Reagan  his press secretary James Brady   Washington police officer Thomas Delahanty   and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy were struck by gunfire from would be assassin John Hinckley Jr    outside the Washington Hilton Hotel   Although  close to death  upon arrival at George Washington University Hospital   Reagan was stabilized in the emergency room  then underwent emergency exploratory surgery    He recovered and was released from the hospital on April 11  becoming the first serving U S  President to survive being shot in an assassination attempt    The attempt had great influence on Reagan s popularity  polls indicated his approval rating to be around 73     Reagan believed that God had spared his life so that he might go on to fulfill a greater purpose     In response to conservative criticism that the state department lacked hardliners  Reagan in 1981 nominated Ernest W  Lefever as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs   Lefever performed poorly at his confirmation hearings and the Senate committee rejected his nomination by vote of 4 13  Lefever withdrew his name     In summer 1981 PATCO  the union of federal air traffic controllers went on strike   violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking    Declaring the situation an emergency as described in the 1947 TaftHartley Act   Reagan stated that if the air traffic controllers  do not report for work within 48 hours  they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated     They did not return and on August 5  Reagan fired 11 345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his order  and used supervisors and military controllers to handle the nation s commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained    A leading reference work on public administration concluded   The firing of PATCO employees not only demonstrated a clear resolve by the president to take control of the bureaucracy  but it also sent a clear message to the private sector that unions no longer needed to be feared      During Jimmy Carter  s last year in office  1980   inflation averaged 12 5   compared with 4 4  during Reagan s last year in office  1988     During Reagan s administration  the unemployment rate declined from 7 5  to 5 4   with the rate reaching highs of 10 8  in 1982 and 10 4  in 1983  averaging 7 5  over the eight years  and real GDP growth averaged 3 44  with a high of 8 55  in 1983  while nominal GDP growth averaged 7 4   and peaked at 12 2  in 1982         Reagan implemented policies based on supply side economics   advocating a laissez faire philosophy and free market fiscal policy    seeking to stimulate the economy with large  across the board tax cuts       He also supported returning the United States to some sort of gold standard   and successfully urged Congress to establish the U S  Gold Commission to study how one could be implemented  Citing the economic theories of Arthur Laffer   Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base  offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation  a theory that entered political discussion as the Laffer curve   Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success  and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt  His policy of   peace through strength   resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40  real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985     During Reagan s presidency  federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981   which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70  to 50  and the lowest bracket from 14  to 11   however other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan  ensured that tax revenues over his two terms were 18 2  of GDP as compared to 18 1  over the 40 year period 19702010    Then  in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law  initiating one of the United States  first public private partnerships and a major part of the president s job creation program   Reagan s Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff  Al Angrisani   was a primary architect of the bill   Conversely  Congress passed and Reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982  TEFRA   Social Security   and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984  DEFRA       Despite the fact that TEFRA was the  largest peacetime tax increase in American history           gross domestic product  GDP  growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982  and grew during his eight years in office at an annual rate of 7 91  per year  with a high of 12 2  growth in 1981    Unemployment peaked at 10 8  monthly rate in December 1982higher than any time since the Great Depressionthen dropped during the rest of Reagan s presidency    Sixteen million new jobs were created  while inflation significantly decreased    The Tax Reform Act of 1986   another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan  simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks  The top rate was dropped to 28   but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20  to 28   The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11  to 15  was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption  standard deduction   and earned income tax credit   The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels       The net effect of all Reagan era tax bills was a 1  decrease in government revenues when compared to Treasury Department revenue estimates from the Administration s first post enactment January budgets    However  federal income tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989  rising from  308 7 billion to  549 billion   or an average annual rate of 8 2   2 5  attributed to higher Social Security receipts   and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of 7 1        Reagan s policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment    which would then lead to higher employment and wages  Critics labeled this   trickle down economics  the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a  trickle down  effect to the poor    Questions arose whether Reagan s policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty    and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles    These views were exacerbated by the fact that Reagan s economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at  3 35 an hour  slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60   cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half  and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program    The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan s economic policies took effect    Along with Reagan s 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income  he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20     Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages  with both topping out at 28     Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency  all in the name of fiscal responsibility    According to Paul Krugman    Over all  the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut  as a share of GDP  the increase was substantially larger than Mr Clinton s 1993 tax increase      According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett  Reagan s tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut     Further following his opposition to government intervention  Reagan cut the budgets of non military   programs   including Medicaid   food stamps   federal education programs   and the EPA     While he protected entitlement programs  such as Social Security and Medicare     his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the Social Security disability rolls     The administration s stance toward the Savings and Loan industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis     It is also suggested  by a minority of Reaganomics critics  that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of 1987     but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash    In order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits  the United States borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad  raising the national debt from  997billion to  2 85trillion    Reagan described the new debt as the  greatest disappointment  of his presidency     He reappointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve   and in 1987 he appointed monetarist Alan Greenspan to succeed him  Reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil which had contributed to energy crises in the early 1970s      The price of oil subsequently dropped  and the 1980s did not see the fuel shortages that the 1970s had    Reagan also fulfilled a 1980 campaign promise to repeal the windfall profit tax in 1988  which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil    Some economists  such as Nobel Prize winners Milton Friedman and Robert A  Mundell   argue that Reagan s tax policies invigorated America s economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s    Other economists  such as Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow   argue that Reagan s deficits were a major reason his successor  George H W  Bush  reneged on a campaign promise and resorted to raising taxes     During Reagan s presidency  a program was initiated within the U S  intelligence community to ensure America s economic strength  The program  Project Socrates   developed and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantageautomated innovation  To ensure that the United States acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation  Reagan  during his second term  had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nationwide basis  However  Reagan s term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed  and the incoming Bush administration  labeling Project Socrates as  industrial policy   had it terminated       Reagan escalated the Cold War  accelerating a reversal from the policy of dtente which began in 1979 after the Soviet war in Afghanistan     Reagan ordered a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces   and implemented new policies towards the Soviet Union  reviving the B 1 Lancer program that had been canceled by the Carter administration   and producing the MX missile     In response to Soviet deployment of the SS 20   Reagan oversaw NATO  s deployment of the Pershing missile in West Germany     Together with the United Kingdom s prime minister Margaret Thatcher   Reagan denounced the Soviet Union in ideological terms    In a famous address on June 8  1982  to the British Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster   Reagan said   the forward march of freedom and democracy will leave MarxismLeninism on the ash heap of history        On March 3  1983  he predicted that communism would collapse  stating   Communism is another sad  bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written     In a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals on March 8  1983  Reagan called the Soviet Union  an evil empire       After Soviet fighters downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007 near Moneron Island on September 1  1983  carrying 269 people  including Georgia congressman Larry McDonald   Reagan labeled the act a  massacre  and declared that the Soviets had turned  against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere     The Reagan administration responded to the incident by suspending all Soviet passenger air service to the United States  and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the Soviets  wounding them financially    As result of the shootdown  and the cause of KAL 007 s going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its navigational system  Reagan announced on September 16  1983  that the Global Positioning System would be made available for civilian use  free of charge  once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in future       Under a policy that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine   Reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anti communist resistance movements in an effort to   rollback   Soviet backed communist governments in Africa  Asia  and Latin America    Reagan deployed the CIA s Special Activities Division to Afghanistan and Pakistan  They were instrumental in training  equipping and leading Mujaheddin forces against the Soviet Army       President Reagan s Covert Action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan    though some of the United States funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat to U S  troops in the 2000s  decade  war in Afghanistan     However  in a break from the Carter policy of arming Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act   Reagan also agreed with the communist government in China to reduce the sale of arms to Taiwan      In March 1983  Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative   a defense project   that would have used ground  and space based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles    Reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible      There was much disbelief surrounding the program s scientific feasibility  leading opponents to dub SDI  Star Wars  and argue that its technological objective was unattainable    The Soviets became concerned about the possible effects SDI would have    leader Yuri Andropov said it would put  the entire world in jeopardy     For those reasons  David Gergen   former aide to President Reagan  believes that in retrospect  SDI hastened the end of the Cold War     Critics labeled Reagan s foreign policies as aggressive  imperialistic  and chided them as  warmongering   though they were supported by leading American conservatives who argued that they were necessary to protect U S  security interests    The Reagan administration also backed anti communist leaders accused of severe human rights violations  such as Efran Ros Montt of Guatemala        With the approval of Congress  Reagan in 1983 sent forces to Lebanon to reduce the threat of the Lebanese Civil War   The American peacekeeping forces in Beirut   a part of a multinational force during the Lebanese Civil War   were attacked on October 23  1983  The Beirut barracks bombing killed 241 American servicemen and wounded more than 60 others by a suicide truck bomber    Reagan sent in USS New Jersey  BB 62 battleship to shell Syrian positions in Lebanon  He then withdrew all the Marines from Lebanon      On October 25  1983  Reagan ordered U S  forces to invade Grenada  code named Operation Urgent Fury   where a 1979 coup d tat had established an independent non aligned MarxistLeninist government  A formal appeal from the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States  OECS  led to the intervention of U S  forces  President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet Cuban military build up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St George s University as adequate reasons to invade  Operation Urgent Fury was the first major military operation conducted by U S  forces since the Vietnam War   several days of fighting commenced  resulting in a U S  victory    with 19 American fatalities and 116 wounded American soldiers    In mid December  after a new government was appointed by the Governor General  U S  forces withdrew     Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in Dallas   Texas  He proclaimed that it was   morning again in America    regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U S  athletes at the 1984 Summer Olympics   among other things    He became the first American president to open an Olympic Games held in the United States     Reagan s opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President Walter Mondale   With questions about Reagan s age  and a weak performance in the first presidential debate  his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned  His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters  they had previously known him clever and witty  Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer s disease       Reagan rebounded in the second debate  and confronted questions about his age  quipping   I will not make age an issue of this campaign  I am not going to exploit  for political purposes  my opponent s youth and inexperience   which generated applause and laughter  even from Mondale himself     That November  Reagan was re elected  winning 49 of 50 states    The president s overwhelming victory saw Mondale carry only his home state of Minnesota  by 3 800 votes  and the District of Columbia  Reagan won a record 525 electoral votes  the most of any candidate in United States history    and received 58 8  of the popular vote to Mondale s 40 6      Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20  1985  in a private ceremony at the White House   Because January 20 fell on a Sunday  a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol Rotunda the following day  January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington  D C   due to poor weather  inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol  In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat  moving White House Chief of Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary Donald Regan   a former Merrill Lynch officer  Chief of Staff       In 1985  Reagan visited a German military cemetery in Bitburg to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl   It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty nine members of the Waffen SS   Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves  victims   a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of the Holocaust   Pat Buchanan   Reagan s Director of Communications  argued that the president did not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust    Now strongly urged to cancel the visit    the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl  He ultimately attended the ceremony where two military generals laid a wreath     The disintegration of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28  1986  proved a pivotal moment in Reagan s presidency  All seven astronauts aboard were killed    On the night of the disaster  Reagan delivered a speech  written by Peggy Noonan   in which he said   The future doesn t belong to the fainthearted  it belongs to the brave   We will never forget them  nor the last time we saw them  this morning  as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and  slipped the surly bonds of Earth  to  touch the face of God      In 1988  near the end of the IranIraq War   the U S  Navy guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes accidentally shot down Iran Air Flight 655 killing 290 civilian passengers  The incident further worsened already tense IranUnited States relations      Reagan announced a War on Drugs in 1982  in response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic   Though Nixon had previously declared a war on drugs  Reagan advocated more militant policies     He said that  drugs were menacing our society  and promised to fight for drug free schools and workplaces  expanded drug treatment  stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts  and greater public awareness       In 1986  Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted  1 7billion to fund the War on Drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses    The bill was criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population   and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street  while resulting in a great financial burden for America    Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use      First Lady Nancy Reagan made the War on Drugs her main priority by founding the   Just Say No   drug awareness campaign  which aimed to discourage children and teenagers from engaging in recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying  no   Nancy Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states  raising awareness about the dangers of drugs including alcohol     Relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were continually contentious  beginning with the Gulf of Sidra incident in 1981  by 1982  Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was considered by the CIA to be  along with USSR leader Leonid Brezhnev and Cuban leader Fidel Castro   part of a group known as the  unholy trinity  and was also labeled as  our international public enemy number one  by a CIA official    These tensions were later revived in early April 1986  when a bomb exploded in a Berlin discothque   resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman  Stating that there was  irrefutable proof  that Libya had directed the  terrorist bombing   Reagan authorized the use of force against the country  In the late evening of April 15  1986  the United States launched a series of air strikes on ground targets in Libya       The UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher allowed the U S  Air Force to use Britain s air bases to launch the attack  on the justification that the UK was supporting America s right to self defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter     The attack was designed to halt Gaddafi s  ability to export terrorism   offering him  incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior     The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office after the attacks had commenced  stating   When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes  we will respond so long as I m in this office     The attack was condemned by many countries  By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions  the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 41 38 which  condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on April 15  1986  which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law      Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986  The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants   required employers to attest to their employees  immigration status  and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States before January 1  1982  and had lived in the country continuously  Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration    Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty   Reagan said   The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows  without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society  Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and  ultimately  if they choose  they may become Americans     Reagan also said   The employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element  It will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here      In 1986  the Iran Contra affair became a problem for the administration stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the IranIraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua   which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress      The IranContra affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s    The International Court of Justice   whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States    ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways  see Nicaragua v  United States         President Reagan professed that he was unaware of the plot s existence  He opened his own investigation and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat   John Tower   Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie   known as the  Tower Commission   to investigate the scandal  The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program  but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff  making the diversion of funds possible    A separate report by Congress concluded that  If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing  he should have     Reagan s popularity declined from 67  to 46  in less than a week  the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president    The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan s staff  and eleven convictions     Many Central Americans criticize Reagan for his support of the Contras  calling him an anti communist zealot  blinded to human rights abuses  while others say he  saved Central America     Daniel Ortega   Sandinistan and president of Nicaragua  said that he hoped God would forgive Reagan for his  dirty war against Nicaragua      Until the early 1980s  the United States had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets  but the gap had been narrowed    Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan s military buildup    their large military expenses  in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing   were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy     At the same time  Saudi Arabia increased oil production    which resulted in a drop of oil prices in 1985 to one third of the previous level  oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues    These factors contributed to a stagnant Soviet economy during Gorbachev  s tenure     Reagan recognized the change in the direction of the Soviet leadership with Mikhail Gorbachev   and shifted to diplomacy  with a view to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements    Reagan s personal mission was to achieve  a world free of nuclear weapons   which he regarded as  totally irrational  totally inhumane  good for nothing but killing  possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization         He was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with General Secretary Gorbachev    Gorbachev and Reagan held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988  the first in Geneva  Switzerland   the second in Reykjavk   Iceland   the third in Washington  D C   and the fourth in Moscow    Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech  this would lead to reform and the end of Communism     Speaking at the Berlin Wall on June 12  1987  Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further  saying  General Secretary Gorbachev  if you seek peace  if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  if you seek liberalization  come here to this gate  Mr  Gorbachev  open this gate  Mr  Gorbachev  tear down this wall     Before Gorbachev s visit to Washington  D C   for the third summit in 1987  the Soviet leader announced his intention to pursue significant arms agreements    The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces  nuclear weapons  and policy in Eastern Europe    He and Reagan signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces  INF  Treaty at the White House  which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons    The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  or START I   Reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks     When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988  he was viewed as a celebrity by the Soviets  A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire   No   he replied   I was talking about another time  another era     At Gorbachev s request  Reagan gave a speech on free markets at the Moscow State University     In his autobiography  An American Life   Reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted and his warm feelings for Gorbachev    In November 1989  ten months after Reagan left office  the Berlin Wall was torn down   the Cold War was officially declared over at the Malta Summit on December 3  1989  and two years later  the Soviet Union collapsed     Early in his presidency  Reagan started wearing a custom  technologically advanced hearing aid   first in his right ear   and later in his left as well    His decision to go public in 1983 regarding his wearing the small  audio amplifying device boosted their sales     On July 13  1985  Reagan underwent surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon   He relinquished presidential power to the Vice President for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the 25th Amendment   which he specifically avoided invoking    The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful    Reagan resumed the powers of the presidency later that day    In August of that year  he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose    In October  additional skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed     In January 1987  Reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate which caused further worries about his health  No cancerous growths were found  however  and he was not sedated during the operation    In July of that year  aged 76  he underwent a third skin cancer operation on his nose     During his 1980 campaign  Reagan pledged that  if given the opportunity  he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice    That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated Sandra Day O Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart   In his second term  Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren Burger as Chief Justice   and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat  Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987  Senator Ted Kennedy   a Democrat of Massachusetts  strongly condemned Bork  and great controversy ensued    Bork s nomination was rejected 5842    Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg   but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use    Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place    Along with his three Supreme Court appointments  Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 290 judges to the United States district courts    Reagan also nominated Vaughn R  Walker   who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge    to the United States District Court for the Central District of California   However  the nomination stalled in the Senate  and Walker was not confirmed until he was renominated by Reagan s successor  George H W  Bush     Early in his tenure  Reagan appointed Clarence M  Pendleton  Jr    of San Diego as the first African American to chair the United States Commission on Civil Rights   Pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with Reagan s views on social and civil rights policy during his time as tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988  Pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the comparable worth proposal as being   Looney Tunes           In 1984  Reagan commuted the 18 year sentence of former Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier   a Democrat from Baton Rouge   to the time served for violations of both the Hobbs and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations acts  On September 23  1980  the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf    Reagan determined that the 18 year sentence was excessive compared to what other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving       After leaving office in 1989  the Reagans purchased a home in Bel Air  Los Angeles in addition to the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara   They regularly attended Bel Air Presbyterian Church   and occasionally made appearances on behalf of the Republican Party  Reagan delivered a well received speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention     Previously on November 4  1991  the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was dedicated and opened to the public  At the dedication ceremonies  five presidents were in attendance  as well as six first ladies  marking the first time that five presidents were gathered in the same location    Reagan continued publicly to speak in favor of a line item veto   the Brady Bill     a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget   and the repeal of the 22nd Amendment   which prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president    In 1992 Reagan established the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award with the newly formed Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation    His final public speech was on February 3  1994  during a tribute to him in Washington  D C   and his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27  1994   In August 1994  at the age of 83  Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease     an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells and ultimately causes death      In November  he informed the nation through a handwritten letter    writing in part   I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer s Disease    At the moment I feel just fine  I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done    I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life  I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead  Thank you  my friends  May God always bless you     After his diagnosis  letters of support from well wishers poured into his California home     But there was also speculation over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration    Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that  in her final meeting with the president in 1986  Reagan did not seem to know who Stahl was  and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile  but at the end of the meeting  Reagan had regained his alertness    However  Dr  Lawrence K  Altman  a physician employed as a reporter for the New York Times   noted that  the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer s can be fuzzy     and all four of Reagan s White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer s while he was president    Dr  John E  Hutton  Reagan s primary physician from 1984 to 1989  said the president  absolutely  did not  show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer s     Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses  though  especially with names    Reagan s doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992   or 1993    several years after he had left office  His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered  ludicrous  the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings    Other staff members  former aides  and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer s while he was president     Complicating the picture  Reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in July 1989  five years before his diagnosis  After being thrown from a horse in Mexico  a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year      Nancy Reagan  citing what doctors told her  asserts that her husband s 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer s disease    although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer s or dementia      Reagan s one time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is possible  but not certain  that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan s memory     As the years went on  the disease slowly destroyed Reagan s mental capacity    He was only able to recognize a few people  including his wife  Nancy    He remained active  however  he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches  played golf regularly  and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby Century City      Reagan suffered a fall at his Bel Air home on January 13  2001  resulting in a broken hip    The fracture was repaired the following day   and the 89 year old Reagan returned home later that week  although he faced difficult physical therapy at home    On February 6  2001  Reagan reached the age of 90  becoming the third former president to do so  the other two being John Adams and Herbert Hoover   with Gerald Ford   George H W  Bush and Jimmy Carter later reaching 90     Reagan s public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease  and as a result  his family decided that he would live in quiet semi isolation with his wife Nancy  Nancy Reagan told CNN s Larry King in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that  Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was     After her husband s diagnosis and death  Nancy Reagan became a stem cell research advocate  urging Congress and President George W  Bush to support federal funding for embryonic stem cell research  something Bush opposed  In 2009  she praised President Barack Obama for lifting restrictions on such research    Mrs  Reagan has said that she believes that it could lead to a cure for Alzheimer s     Reagan died of pneumonia   complicated by Alzheimer s disease     at his home in Bel Air  California  on the afternoon of June 5  2004    A short time after his death  Nancy Reagan released a statement saying   My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan has died after 10 years of Alzheimer s disease at 93 years of age  We appreciate everyone s prayers     President George W  Bush declared June 11 a National Day of Mourning     and international tributes came in from around the world    Reagan s body was taken to the Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica  California later in the day  where well wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and American flags in the grass    On June 7  his body was removed and taken to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library   where a brief family funeral was held conducted by Pastor Michael Wenning   His body lay in repose in the Library lobby until June 9  over 100 000 people viewed the coffin     On June 9  Reagan s body was flown to Washington  D C  where he became the tenth United States president to lie in state   in thirty four hours  104 684 people filed past the coffin     On June 11  a state funeral was conducted in the Washington National Cathedral   and presided over by President George W  Bush  Eulogies were given by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher     former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney   and both former President George H W  Bush and President George W  Bush   Also in attendance were Mikhail Gorbachev   and many world leaders  including British Prime Minister Tony Blair   Prince Charles   representing his mother Queen Elizabeth II   German Chancellor Gerhard Schrder   Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi   and interim presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan  and Ghazi al Yawer of Iraq     After the funeral  the Reagan entourage was flown back to the Ronald W  Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley  California  where another service was held  and President Reagan was interred    At the time of his death  Reagan was the longest lived president in U S  history  having lived 93 years and 120 days  2 years  8 months  and 23 days longer than John Adams   whose record he surpassed   He is now the second longest lived president  just 45 days fewer than Gerald Ford   He was the first United States president to die in the 21st century  and his was the first state funeral in the United States since that of President Lyndon B  Johnson in 1973   His burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered at the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library    I know in my heart that man is good  that what is right will always eventually triumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life      Since Reagan left office in 1989  substantial debate has occurred among scholars  historians  and the general public surrounding his legacy    Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan s economic policies    foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War    and a restoration of American pride and morale    Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States    after a decline in American confidence and self respect under Jimmy Carter  s perceived weak leadership  particularly during the Iranian hostage crisis   as well as his gloomy  dreary outlook for the future of the United States during the 1980 election    Critics contend that Reagan s economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits    a wider gap in wealth   and an increase in homelessness   and that the Iran Contra affair lowered American credibility     Opinions of Reagan s legacy among the country s leading policy makers and journalists differ as well  Edwin Feulner   president of The Heritage Foundation   said that Reagan  helped create a safer  freer world  and said of his economic policies   He took an America suffering from  malaise     and made its citizens believe again in their destiny     However  Mark Weisbrot   co Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research   contended that Reagan s  economic policies were mostly a failure    while Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post opined that Reagan was  a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest      Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy  many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since Franklin D  Roosevelt   leaving his imprint on American politics  diplomacy  culture  and economics through his effective communication  dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising    Since he left office  historians have reached a consensus    as summarized by British historian M  J  Heale   who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism  turned the nation to the right  practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics  revived faith in the presidency and in American exceptionalism   and contributed to victory in the Cold War     The Cold War was a major political  economic and military endeavor for over four decades  but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of Reagan s presidency    The significance of Reagan s role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate        That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed  but the extent of this role is continuously debated    with many believing that Reagan s defense policies  economic policies  military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism  as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War       He was first among postWorld War II presidents to put into practice the concept that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with  a post Dtente strategy    a conviction that was vindicated by Gennadi Gerasimov   the Foreign Ministry spokesman under Gorbachev  who said that the Strategic Defense Initiative was  very successful blackmail      The Soviet economy couldn t endure such competition     Reagan s aggressive rhetoric toward the USSR had mixed effects  Jeffery W  Knopf observes that being labeled  evil  probably made no difference to the Soviets but gave encouragement to the East European citizens opposed to communism     General Secretary Gorbachev said of his former rival s Cold War role    He was  a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the Cold War     and deemed him  a great president     Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war  but rather a peaceful end  he said he was not intimidated by Reagan s harsh rhetoric    Margaret Thatcher  former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom   said of Reagan   he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power    but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform     She later said   Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired     Said Brian Mulroney   former Prime Minister of Canada    He enters history as a strong and dramatic player  in the Cold War      Former President Lech Wa  sa of Poland acknowledged   Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism s collapse     That Reagan had little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight  that Communism s internal weakness had become apparent  and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power    President Harry Truman  s policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the U S S R   and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself     Ronald Reagan reshaped the Republican party  led the modern conservative movement   and altered the political dynamic of the United States    More men voted Republican under Reagan  and Reagan tapped into religious voters    The so called   Reagan Democrats   were a result of his presidency     After leaving office  Reagan became an iconic influence within the Republican party    His policies and beliefs have been frequently invoked by Republican presidential candidates since 1989    The 2008 Republican presidential candidates were no exception  for they aimed to liken themselves to him during the primary debates  even imitating his campaign strategies    Republican nominee John McCain frequently said that he came to office as  a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution     Reagan s most famous statement regarding the role of smaller government was that  Government is not a solution to our problem  government is the problem      Reagan has become an iconic figure in the Republican Party  with praise for his accomplishments part of the standard GOP rhetoric a quarter century after his retirement  Washington Post reporter Carlos Lozada notes how in the 2016 presidential race the main Republican contenders have adopted  standard GOP Gipper worship   including even Donald Trump  who previously had been skeptical     The period of American history most dominated by Ronald Reagan and his policies concerning taxes  welfare  defense  the federal judiciary and the Cold War is known today as the Reagan Era   and emphasizes that the conservative  Reagan Revolution   led by Reagan  had a permanent impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy  The Clinton presidency  19932001  is often treated as an extension of the Reagan Era  as is the Bush presidency  20012009     Historian Eric Foner noted that the Obama candidacy in 2008  aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of Reaganism      Campaigning for the Democratic nomination in 2008  Barack Obama   an American liberal   interpreted how Reagan changed the nation s trajectory   I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not  He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it  I think they felt like with all the excesses of the 1960s and 1970s and government had grown and grown but there wasn t much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating  I think that people    he just tapped into what people were already feeling  which was we want clarity  we want optimism  we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing     According to columnist Chuck Raasch   Reagan transformed the American presidency in ways that only a few have been able to     He redefined the political agenda of the times  advocating lower taxes  a conservative economic philosophy   and a stronger military    His role in the Cold War further enhanced his image as a different kind of leader      Reagan s  avuncular style  optimism  and plain folks demeanor  also helped him turn  government bashing into an art form      As a sitting president  Reagan did not have the highest approval ratings    but his popularity has increased since 1989  Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history  Reagan ranked third of postWorld War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll  fifth in an ABC 2000 poll  ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll  and eighth in a late 2008 poll by United Kingdom newspaper The Times         In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians  however  Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42      While the debate about Reagan s legacy is ongoing  the 2009 Annual C SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president  The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000     In 2011  the Institute for the Study of the Americas released the first ever UK academic survey to rate U S  presidents  This poll of UK

Of it  Reagan said   I won the nickname the great communicator  But I never thought it was my style that made a differenceit was the content  I wasn t a great communicator  but I communicated great things     His age and soft spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image         Reagan also earned the nickname  the Teflon President   in that public perceptions of him were not tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration    According to Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder   who coined the phrase  and reporter Howard Kurtz  the epithet referred to Reagan s ability to  do almost anything wrong   and not get blamed for it        Public reaction to Reagan was always mixed  the oldest president was supported by young voters  and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party    Reagan did not fare well with minority groups  especially African Americans    This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies    However  his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews     He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency  although he was the first president to have been divorced    The combination of Reagan s speaking style  unabashed patriotism  negotiation skills  as well as his savvy use of the media  played an important role in defining the 1980s and his future legacy     Reagan was known to joke frequently during his lifetime  displayed humor throughout his presidency    and was famous for his storytelling     His numerous jokes and one liners have been labeled  classic quips  and  legendary     Among the most notable of his jokes was one regarding the Cold War  As a microphone test in preparation for his weekly radio address in August 1984

of the United States  First Term  Second Term  Third Term  Fourth Term    Franklin Delano Roosevelt       r o  z   v   l t     his own pronunciation    or     r o  z   v   l t      January30  1882 April12  1945   commonly known by his initials FDR   was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd President of the United States     A Democrat   he won a record four elections and served from March1933 to his death in April1945  He was a central figure in world events during the mid 20th century  leading the United States during a time of worldwide economic depression and total war  His program for relief  recovery and reform  known as the New Deal   involved the great expansion of the role of the federal government in the economy  A dominant leader of the Democratic Party  he built the New Deal Coalition that united labor unions  big city machines  white ethnics  African Americans  and rural white Southerners  The Coalition realigned American politics after 1932  creating the Fifth Party System and defining American liberalism for the middle third of the 20th century   Roosevelt was born in 1882 to an old  prominent Dutch family from upstate New York   He attended the elite institutions of Groton School and Harvard College   In 1905  he married Eleanor Roosevelt   with whom he had six children  He entered politics in 1910  serving in the New York State Senate   and then as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson   In 1920  Roosevelt ran for vice president alongside presidential candidate James M  Cox but the Cox Roosevelt ticket lost to the Republican ticket of Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge   Roosevelt was stricken with polio in 1921  which cost him the use of his legs and put his political career on hold for several years  Roosevelt attempted to recover from this illness  and founded a treatment center for people with polio in Warm Springs  Georgia   After returning to political life by placing Alfred E  Smith  s name into nomination at the 1924 Democratic National Convention   Roosevelt was asked by Smith to run for Governor of New York in the 1928 election  Roosevelt served as a reform governor from 1929 to 1932  and promoted the enactment of programs to combat the Great Depression that occurred during his governorship   Roosevelt defeated incumbent Republican president Herbert Hoover in November1932   at the depth of the Great Depression  Energized by his personal victory over polio   FDR used his persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit    In his first hundred days in office  which began March4  1933  Roosevelt spearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deala variety of programs designed to produce relief  government jobs for the unemployed   recovery  economic growth   and reform  through regulation of Wall Street  banks and transportation   He created numerous programs to support the unemployed and farmers  and to encourage labor union growth while more closely regulating business and high finance  The repeal of Prohibition added to his popularity  helping him win reelection by a landslide in 1936  The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937  but then relapsed into a deep recession in 193738  The bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme Court   blocked all proposals for major liberal legislation  apart from a minimum wage law   and abolished many of the relief programs when unemployment practically vanished during World War II  Most of the regulations on business continued in effect until they ended about 197585  except for the regulation of Wall Street by the still existing Securities and Exchange Commission   Along with several smaller programs  major surviving programs include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Social Security    As World War II loomed after 1938  with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany  Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and the United Kingdom  while remaining officially neutral  His goal was to make America the   Arsenal of Democracy    which would supply munitions to the Allies  In March1941  Roosevelt  with Congressional approval  provided Lend Lease aid to Britain and China  After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December7  1941  which he called a   date which will live in infamy    he made war on Japan and Germany  Assisted by his top aide Harry Hopkins   and with very strong national support  he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in leading the Allies against Nazi Germany   Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan in World War II   He supervised the mobilization of the U S  economy to support the war effort  and also ordered the internment of 100 000 Japanese American civilians  As an active military leader  Roosevelt implemented a war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis Powers and the development of the world s first nuclear bomb   His work also influenced the later creation of the United Nations and Bretton Woods   During the war  unemployment dropped to 2   relief programs largely ended  and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to wartime factory jobs or entered military service    Roosevelt s health seriously declined during the war years  and he died three months into his fourth term  He is often rated by scholars as one of the top three U S  Presidents   along with Abraham Lincoln and George Washington       One of the oldest Dutch families in New York State  the Roosevelts   a   distinguished themselves in areas other than politics  One ancestor  Isaac Roosevelt  had served with the New York militia during the American Revolution    Roosevelt attended events of the New York society Sons of the American Revolution   and joined the organization while he was president  His paternal family had become prosperous early on in New York real estate and trade  and much of his immediate family s wealth had been built by FDR s maternal grandfather  Warren Delano  Jr   in the China trade  including opium and tea      Roosevelt was born on January30  1882  in the Hudson Valley town of Hyde Park  New York to businessman James Roosevelt I  18281900  and Sara Ann Delano  18541941   His parents were sixth cousins   and both were from wealthy old New York families  They were of mostly English descent  Roosevelt s patrilineal great grandfather  Jacobus Roosevelt III   was of Dutch ancestry  and his mother s maiden name  Delano   could be traced to a French Huguenot immigrant ancestor of the 17th century      Their only child   was to have been named Warren  but Sara s infant nephew of that name had recently died    Their son was named for Sara s uncle Franklin Hughes Delano     Roosevelt grew up in an atmosphere of privilege  reportedly  when James Roosevelt took his five years old young son   to visit President Grover Cleveland in the White House  the busy president told Franklin   I have one wish for you  little man  that you will never be President of the United States       Sara was a possessive mother  James  54 when Franklin was born  was considered by some as a remote father  though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time    Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin s early years    she once declared   My son Franklin is a Delano  not a Roosevelt at all     Frequent trips to Europehe made his first at the age of two  and went with his parents every year from the ages of seven to 15    helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French    being arrested with his tutor by police four times in one day in the Black Forest for minor offenses may have affected the future president s view of German character    He learned to ride  shoot  row  and play polo and lawn tennis  Roosevelt also took up golf in his teen years  becoming a skilled long hitter    He learned to sail  and his father gave him a sailboat at the age of 16 which he named  New Moon      Roosevelt attended Groton School   an Episcopal boarding school in Massachusetts  90  of the students were from families on the social register   He was strongly influenced by its headmaster  Endicott Peabody   who preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service  Forty years later Roosevelt said of Peabody   It was a blessing in my life to have the privilege of  his  guiding hand     and the headmaster remained a strong influence throughout his life  officiating at his wedding and visiting Roosevelt as president    Peabody recalled Roosevelt as  a quiet  satisfactory boy of more than ordinary intelligence  taking a good position in his form but not brilliant     while a classmate described Roosevelt as  nice  but completely colorless   an average student  he only stood out in being the only Democratic student  continuing the political tradition of his side of the Roosevelt family    Roosevelt remained consistent in his politics  immediately after his fourth election to the presidency  he defined his domestic policy as  a little left of center        Like all but two of his 21 Groton classmates  Roosevelt went to Harvard College     where he lived in a suite which is now part of Adams House   in the  Gold Coast  area populated by wealthy students  Again an average student academically    Roosevelt later declared   I took economics courses in college for four years  and everything I was taught was wrong     He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity   and the Fly Club    While undistinguished as a student or athlete  he became editor in chief of The Harvard Crimson daily newspaper    a position which required great ambition  energy  and ability to manage others    While he was at Harvard  his fifth cousin Theodore  T R   Roosevelt  Jr   18581919  became President of the United States  his vigorous leadership style and reforming zeal made him Franklin s role model and hero    The younger Roosevelt remained a Democrat  campaigning for Theodore s opponent William Jennings Bryan     In mid 1902  Franklin was formally introduced to his future wife Anna Eleanor Roosevelt  18841962   Theodore s niece  on a train to Tivoli  New York   although they had met briefly as children    Eleanor and Franklin were fifth cousins  once removed    She was the daughter of Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt  186094  and Anna Rebecca Hall  186392  of the Livingston family   At the time of their engagement  Roosevelt was twenty two and Eleanor nineteen    Roosevelt graduated from Harvard in 1903 with an A B  in history  He later received an honorary LL D  from Harvard in 1929     Roosevelt entered Columbia Law School in 1904  dropping out in 1907 after passing the New York State Bar exam    He later received a posthumous J D  from Columbia Law School    In 1908  he took a job with the prestigious Wall Street firm of Carter Ledyard   Milburn     dealing mainly with corporate law  He was first initiated in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and was initiated into Freemasonry on October11  1911  at Holland Lodge No  8  New York City       On March17  1905  Roosevelt married Eleanor despite the fierce resistance of his mother    While she did not dislike Eleanor  Sara Roosevelt was very possessive of her son  believing he was too young  she several times attempted to break the engagement    Eleanor s uncle  the president  stood in at the wedding for Eleanor s deceased father Elliott   as Eleanor was his favorite niece     Eleanor had lost both parents by age ten       The young couple moved into Springwood   his family s estate  where Roosevelt s mother became a frequent house guest  much to Eleanor s chagrin  The home was owned by Roosevelt s mother until her death in 1941 and was very much her home as well  In addition  Franklin Roosevelt and his mother Sara did the planning and furnishing of a town house she had built for the young couple in New York City  she had a twin house built alongside  with connections on every floor  Eleanor never felt it was her house   Biographer James MacGregor Burns says young Roosevelt was self assured and at ease in the upper class    In contrast  Eleanor at the time was shy and disliked social life  and at first stayed at home to raise their several children  Although Eleanor had an aversion to sexual intercourse  and considered it  an ordeal to be endured     they had six children  the first four in rapid succession   Roosevelt liked fatherhood  and the parents suffered greatly when their third child  named for Franklin  died of heart disease in infancy in 1909  Eleanor soon was pregnant again and gave birth to another son  Elliott  less than a year later  The fifth child and fourth son  born in 1914  was also named for Franklin  Their sixth child  John  was their fifth son   Roosevelt had affairs outside his marriage  including one with Eleanor s social secretary Lucy Mercer   which began soon after she was hired in early 1914    In September1918  Eleanor found letters revealing the affair in Roosevelt s luggage  when he returned from World War I   Franklin had contemplated divorcing Eleanor  but Lucy would not agree to marry a divorced man with five children    Franklin and Eleanor remained married  and FDR promised never to see Lucy again  Eleanor never truly forgave him  and their marriage from that point on was more of a political partnership  His mother Sara told Franklin that if he divorced his wife  it would bring scandal upon the family  and she  would not give him another dollar      Franklin broke his promise to Eleanor  He and Lucy maintained a formal correspondence  and began seeing each other again in 1941  perhaps earlier      The Secret Service gave Lucy the code name  Mrs  Johnson      Lucy was with FDR on the day he died  Despite this  FDR s affair was not widely known until the 1960s    Roosevelt s son Elliott said that Franklin also had a 20 year affair with his private secretary Marguerite  Missy  LeHand     Another son  James  stated that  there is a real possibility that a romantic relationship existed  between his father and Princess Mrtha of Sweden   who resided in the White House during part of World War II  Aides began to refer to her at the time as  the president s girlfriend     and gossip linking the two romantically appeared in the newspapers     The effect of these flirtations or affairs upon Eleanor Roosevelt is difficult to estimate   I have the memory of an elephant  I can forgive  but I cannot forget   she wrote to a close friend    After the Lucy Mercer affair  any remaining intimacy left their relationship  Eleanor soon thereafter established a separate house in Hyde Park at Val Kill   and increasingly devoted herself to various social and political causes  For the rest of their lives  the Roosevelts  marriage was more of a political partnership than an intimate relationship    The emotional break in their marriage was so severe that when Roosevelt asked Eleanor in 1942in light of his failing healthto come back home and live with him again  she refused    He was not always aware of when she visited the White House  and for some time she could not easily reach him on the telephone without his secretary s help  he  in turn  did not visit her New York City apartment until late 1944     When Roosevelt was President  his dog  Fala   also became well known as his companion during his time in the White House  Fala was called the  most photographed dog in the world      The birthplace of FDR at Springwood   Roosevelt sailing with half niece Helen and father James  1899   Franklin and Eleanor at Campobello Island   Canada  in 1904   Franklin and Eleanor Statues at FDR National Historic Site in Hyde Park  New York   Franklin  left  with nephew Tadd  middle  and niece Helen  right  in January1889   In the state election of 1910   Roosevelt ran for the New York State Senate from the district around Hyde Park in Dutchess County   which was strongly Republican  having elected one Democrat since 1856  The local party chose him as a paper candidate because his Republican cousin Theodore was still one of the country s most prominent politicians  and a Democratic Roosevelt was good publicity  the candidate could also pay for his own campaign  Surprising almost everyone  due to his aggressive and effective campaign    the Roosevelt name s influence in the Hudson Valley  and the Democratic landslide that year  Roosevelt won the election     Taking his seat on January1  1911  Roosevelt immediately became the leader of a group of  Insurgents  who opposed the bossism of the Tammany machine dominating the state Democratic Party  The U S  Senate election   which began with the Democratic caucus on January16  1911  was deadlocked by the struggle of the two factions for 74 days  as the new legislator endured what a biographer later described as  the full might of Tammany  behind its choice  William F  Sheehan    Popular election of US Senators did not occur until after a constitutional amendment   On March31 compromise candidate James A  O Gorman was elected  giving Roosevelt national exposure and some experience in political tactics and intrigue  one Tammany leader warned that Roosevelt should be eliminated immediately  before he disrupted Democrats as much as his cousin disrupted the Republicans       Roosevelt soon became a popular figure among New York Democrats  though he had not as yet become an eloquent speaker    News articles and cartoons began depicting  the second coming of a Roosevelt  that sent  cold shivers down the spine of Tammany      Despite a bout of typhoid fever   and thanks to the help of Louis McHenry Howe who ran his campaign  Roosevelt was re elected for a second term in the state election of 1912   and served as chairman of the Agriculture Committee  His success with farm and labor bills was a precursor to his New Deal policies twenty years later    By this time he had become more consistently progressive  in support of labor and social welfare programs for women and children  cousin Theodore was of some influence on these issues    Roosevelt  again in opposition to Tammany Hall  supported southerner Woodrow Wilson  s successful bid in the 1912 presidential election  and thereby earned an informal designation as an original Wilson man     Roosevelt s support of Wilson led to his appointment in 1913 as Assistant Secretary of the Navy   under Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels   Roosevelt had a lifelong affection for the Navy he had already collected almost 10 000 naval books and claimed to have read all but oneand was more ardent than his boss Daniels in supporting a large and efficient naval force      As assistant secretary  Roosevelt worked to expand the Navy and founded the United States Navy Reserve   Against reactionary older officers such as Admiral William Benson who claimed he could not  conceive of any use the fleet will ever have for aviation Roosevelt personally ordered the preservation of the navy s Aviation Division after the war    despite publicly opining that Billy Mitchell  s warnings of bombs capable of sinking battleships were  pernicious     Roosevelt negotiated with Congressional leaders and other government departments to get budgets approved  He opposed the Taylor  stop watch  system  which was hailed by shipbuilding managers but opposed by the unions  Not a single union strike occurred during his seven plus years in the office    during which Roosevelt gained experience in labor issues  government management during wartime  naval issues  and logistics  all valuable areas for future office     Roosevelt was still relatively obscure  but his friends were already speaking of him as a future president  he reportedly began talking about being elected to the presidency as early as 1907    In 1914  Roosevelt made an ill conceived decision to run for the U S  Senate seat for New York  The decision was doomed for lack of Wilson administration backing  He was determined to take on Tammany again at a time when Wilson needed them to help marshal his legislation and secure his future re election    He was soundly defeated in the Democratic primary election for the United States Senate by Tammany Hall backed James W  Gerard   by a margin of 3 to 1    Roosevelt learned a valuable lesson  that federal patronage alone  without White House support  could not defeat a strong local organization     In March1917  after Germany initiated its submarine warfare campaign  Roosevelt asked Wilson for permission  which was denied  to fit the naval fleet out for war    He became an enthusiastic advocate of the submarine and of means to combat the German submarine menace to Allied shipping  he proposed building a mine barrier across the North Sea from Norway to Scotland    In 1918  he visited Scotland  England  Wales  and France to inspect American naval facilities    Roosevelt wanted to provide arms to the merchant marine  knowing that a sale of arms was prohibited  he asked Wilson for approval to lease the arms to the mariners  Wilson ultimately approved this by executive order  and a precedent was set for Roosevelt to take similar action in 1940   During these war years  Roosevelt worked to make peace with the Tammany Hall forces  and in 1918 the group supported others in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to run for governor of New York  He very much wanted to get into a military uniform  but the armistice took shape before this could materialize    Wilson reportedly ordered Roosevelt to not resign    With the end of World War I in November1918  Roosevelt was in charge of demobilization  although he opposed plans to completely dismantle the Navy   In 1918  Roosevelt was sickened during the 1918 flu pandemic   and survived    In 1919  newspapers in Newport  Rhode Island criticized Roosevelt over his handling of what came to be known as the Newport sex scandal     Much more threatening was the fact that Roosevelt and his wife  then living in Washington  D C  across the street from Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer   narrowly missed becoming casualties of an anarchist s bomb that exploded at Palmer s house  which they had walked past just minutes before  Their own residence was close enough that one of the bomber s body parts landed on their doorstep     The 1920 Democratic National Convention chose Roosevelt by acclamation as the vice presidential candidate   with its presidential candidate  Governor James M  Cox of Ohio  Although his nomination surprised most people  Roosevelt was considered as bringing balance to the ticket as a moderate  a Wilsonian  and a prohibitionist with a famous name      Roosevelt had just turned 38  four years younger than Theodore had been when he received the same nomination from his party  The Cox Roosevelt ticket was defeated by Republicans Warren G  Harding and Calvin Coolidge in the presidential election by a wide margin    Roosevelt returned to New York to practice law and joined the newly organized New York Civitan Club     In August1921  while the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island   New Brunswick  Canada  Roosevelt fell ill and was diagnosed with polio        236 It left him with permanent paralysis from the waist down  Following the illness  Roosevelt remained out of the public eye for several years  turning his attention away from politics and toward his legal practice  For the rest of his life  Roosevelt refused to accept that he was permanently paralyzed    He tried a wide range of therapies  including hydrotherapy   In 1926  he purchased a resort at Warm Springs  Georgia   where he founded a hydrotherapy center for the treatment of polio patients  it still operates as the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation     In 1938 FDR founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis  now known as the March of Dimes        At the time  Roosevelt convinced many people that he was improving  which he believed to be essential prior to running for public office again    He laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs by swiveling his torso  supporting himself with a cane    He was careful never to be seen using his wheelchair in public  and great care was taken to prevent any portrayal in the press that would highlight his disability     332 Few photographs of FDR in his wheelchair are known  they include two taken by his cousin and confidante Margaret Suckley     another taken by a sailor aboard the USS Indianapolis in 1933    and another published in a 1937 issue of Life magazine     332333 Film clips of the  walk  he achieved after his illness are equally rare      He usually appeared in public standing upright  supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons  FDR used a car with specially designed hand controls  providing him further mobility     A 2003 retrospective diagnosis of Roosevelt s paralytic illness favored GuillainBarr syndrome rather than polio      a conclusion criticized by other researchers   Roosevelt maintained contacts and mended fences with the Democratic Party during the 1920s  especially in New York  Although he initially had made his name as an opponent of New York City  s Tammany Hall machine   Roosevelt moderated his stance against that group as well    He helped Alfred E  Smith win the election for governor of New York in 1922  and in 1924 was a strong supporter of Smith against his cousin  Republican Theodore Roosevelt  Jr    Roosevelt gave nominating speeches for Smith at the 1924 and 1928 Democratic conventions  the speech at the 1924 election marked a return to public life following his illness and convalescence     As the Democratic Party presidential nominee in the 1928 election   Smith in turn asked Roosevelt to run for governor in the state election   Roosevelt was nominated by the Democrats by acclamation    While Smith lost the Presidency in a landslide  and was defeated in his home state  Roosevelt was narrowly elected governor  by a one percent margin    As a reform governor  he established a number of new social programs  and was advised by Frances Perkins and Harry Hopkins     In April1929 a bomb was found addressed to him at the Albany  New York post office  A porter kicked the package  causing the fuse to sputter  The device was dropped in a pail of water where it failed to go off     In May1930  as he began his run for a second term  Roosevelt reiterated his doctrine from the campaign two years before   that progressive government by its very terms  must be a living and growing thing  that the battle for it is never ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year  not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization     In this campaign for re election  Roosevelt needed the good will of the Tammany Hall machine in New York City to succeed  but  his Republican opponent  Charles H  Tuttle   used Roosevelt s connection with Tammany Hall s corruption as an election issue  As the election approached  Roosevelt began preemptive efforts by initiating investigations of the sale of judicial offices  He was directly involved  as he had made a routine short term court appointment of a Tammany Hall man who was alleged to have paid Tammany  30 000 for the position    His Republican opponent could not overcome the public s criticism of the Republican Party for current economic distress in the Great Depression   and Roosevelt was elected to a second term by a margin of fourteen percent     Roosevelt s strong base in the most populous state made him an obvious candidate for the Democratic nomination  which was hotly contested in light of incumbent Herbert Hoover  s vulnerability  Al Smith was supported by some city bosses  but had lost control of the New York Democratic party to Roosevelt  Roosevelt built his own national coalition with personal allies such as newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst   Irish leader Joseph P  Kennedy  Sr    and California leader William Gibbs McAdoo   When Texas leader John Nance Garner announced his support of FDR  he was given the vice presidential nomination     Breaking with tradition of the time  Roosevelt traveled to Chicago to accept the nomination in person  In his acceptance speech  Roosevelt declared   I pledge you  I pledge myself to a new deal for the American people    This is more than a political campaign  It is a call to arms     The election campaign was conducted under the shadow of the Great Depression in the United States   and the new alliances which it created  Roosevelt and the Democratic Party mobilized the expanded ranks of the poor as well as organized labor  ethnic minorities  urbanites  and Southern whites  crafting the New Deal coalition   At that time  African Americans in the South were still disfranchised   as they had been since the turn of the century  Southern states had passed a variety of requirements making voter registration more difficult  which served to exclude most blacks and many poor whites from the political system   Economist Marriner Eccles observed that  given later developments  the campaign speeches often read like a giant misprint  in which Roosevelt and Hoover speak each other s lines     Roosevelt denounced Hoover s failures to restore prosperity or halt the downward slide  and he ridiculed Hoover s huge deficits  Roosevelt campaigned on the Democratic platform advocating  immediate and drastic reductions of all public expenditures    abolishing useless commissions and offices  consolidating departments and bureaus  and eliminating extravagances  and for a  sound currency to be maintained at all hazards   On September23  Roosevelt made the gloomy evaluation that   Our industrial plant is built  the problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt  Our last frontier has long since been reached     Hoover damned that pessimism as a denial of  the promise of American life    the counsel of despair     The prohibition issue solidified the  wet vote  for Roosevelt  who noted that repeal would bring in new tax revenues   Roosevelt won 57 percent of the vote and carried all but six states  Historians and political scientists consider the 193236 elections a realigning election that created a new majority coalition for the Democrats  made up of organized labor  northern blacks  and ethnic Americans such as Italian Americans  Polish Americans and Jews  This transformed American politics and started what is called the  New Deal Party System  or  by political scientists  the Fifth Party System      After the election  Roosevelt refused Hoover s requests for a meeting to develop a joint program to stop the downward spiral and calm investors  claiming publicly it would tie his hands  and that Hoover had all the power to act if necessary  Unofficially  he told reporters that  it is not my baby     The economy spiraled downward until the banking system began a complete nationwide shutdown as Hoover s term ended    In February1933  Roosevelt escaped an assassination attempt  Giuseppe Zangara   who expressed a  hate for all rulers   attempted to shoot Roosevelt  He shot and killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak who was sitting alongside Roosevelt  but his attempt to murder Roosevelt failed when an alert spectator  Lillian Cross  hit his arm with her purse and deflected the bullet        Roosevelt leaned heavily on his  Brain Trust  of academic advisers  especially Raymond Moley   when designing his policies  he offered cabinet positions to numerous candidates  but some declined  The cabinet member with the strongest independent base was Cordell Hull at State  William Hartman Woodin  at Treasury was soon replaced by the much more powerful Henry Morgenthau  Jr     Roosevelt appointed powerful men to top positions but made certain he made all the major decisions  regardless of delays  inefficiency or resentment  Analyzing the president s administrative style  historian James MacGregor Burns concludes   When Roosevelt was inaugurated March4  1933   the U S  was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history  A quarter of the workforce was unemployed  Farmers were in deep trouble as prices fell by 60   Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929  Two million people were homeless  By the evening of March4  32 of the 48 states as well as the District of Columbia had closed their banks    The New York Federal Reserve Bank was unable to open on the 5th  as huge sums had been withdrawn by panicky customers in previous days    Beginning with his inauguration address  Roosevelt began blaming the economic crisis on bankers and financiers  the quest for profit  and the self interest basis of capitalism   Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind s goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence  have admitted their failure  and have abdicated  Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion  rejected by the hearts and minds of men  True they have tried  but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition  Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money  Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership  they have resorted to exhortations  pleading tearfully for restored confidence    The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization  We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths  The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit     Historians categorized Roosevelt s program as  relief  recovery and reform   Relief was urgently needed by tens of millions of unemployed  Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal  Reform meant long term fixes of what was wrong  especially with the financial and banking systems  Through Roosevelt s series of radio talks  known as fireside chats   he presented his proposals directly to the American public    In 1934 FDR paid a visit to retired Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes   who mused about the President   A second class intellect  But a first class temperament      Roosevelt s   First 100 Days   concentrated on the first part of his strategy  immediate relief  From March9 to June16  1933  he sent Congress a record number of bills  all of which passed easily  To propose programs  Roosevelt relied on leading Senators such as George Norris   Robert F  Wagner   and Hugo Black   as well as his Brain Trust of academic advisers  Like Hoover  he saw the Depression caused in part by people no longer spending or investing because they were afraid   Roosevelt s inauguration on March 4  1933  occurred in the middle of a bank panic   hence the backdrop for his famous words   The only thing we have to fear is fear itself     The very next day he declared a  bank holiday  and called for a special session of Congress to start March9  at which Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act     This was his first proposed step to recovery  To give Americans confidence in the banks  Roosevelt signed the GlassSteagall Act that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC  to underwrite savings deposits   Relief measures included the continuation of Hoover s major relief program for the unemployed under its new name  Federal Emergency Relief Administration   The most popular of all New Deal agencies and Roosevelt s favorite was the Civilian Conservation Corps  CCC   which hired 250 000 unemployed young men to work on rural local projects     Congress also gave the Federal Trade Commission broad new regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners    Roosevelt expanded a Hoover agency  the Reconstruction Finance Corporation   making it a major source of financing for railroads and industry  Roosevelt made agricultural relief a high priority and set up the first Agricultural Adjustment Administration  AAA   The AAA tried to force higher prices for commodities by paying farmers to take land out of crops and to cut herds     Reform of the economy was the goal of the National Industrial Recovery Act  NIRA  of 1933  It tried to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to come up with codes that established the rules of operation for all firms within specific industries  such as minimum prices  agreements not to compete  and production restrictions  Industry leaders negotiated the codes which were approved by NIRA officials  Industry needed to raise wages as a condition for approval  Provisions encouraged unions and suspended anti trust laws  The NIRA was found to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision of the US Supreme Court on May27  1935  Roosevelt opposed the decision  saying   The fundamental purposes and principles of the NIRA are sound  To abandon them is unthinkable  It would spell the return to industrial and labor chaos     In 1933  major new banking regulations were passed  In 1934  the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate Wall Street  with 1932 campaign fundraiser Joseph P  Kennedy in charge     Roosevelt wanted a federal minimum wage as part of the NIRA  arguing that   No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country     The nation finally adopted the minimum wage in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938  the last major domestic reform measure of the New Deal     Recovery was pursued through  pump priming   that is  federal spending     The NIRA included  3 3billion of spending through the Public Works Administration to stimulate the economy  which was to be handled by Interior Secretary Harold Ickes   Roosevelt worked with Republican Senator George Norris to create the largest government owned industrial enterprise in American history the Tennessee Valley Authority  TVA  which built dams and power stations  controlled floods  and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty stricken Tennessee Valley  The repeal of prohibition also brought in new tax revenues and helped Roosevelt keep a major campaign promise  Executive Order 6102 declared that all privately held gold of American citizens was to be sold to the US Treasury and the price raised from  20 to  35 per ounce  The goal was to counter the deflation which was paralyzing the economy     Roosevelt tried to keep his campaign promise by cutting the federal budget including a reduction in military spending from  752million in 1932 to  531million in 1934 and a 40  cut in spending on veterans  benefits by removing 500 000 veterans and widows from the pension rolls and reducing benefits for the remainder  as well as cutting the salaries of federal employees and reducing spending on research and education  But  the veterans were well organized and strongly protested  most benefits were restored or increased by 1934  but FDR vetoed their efforts to get a cash bonus    The benefit cuts also did not last  In June1933  Roosevelt restored  50 million in pension payments  and Congress added another  46 million more    Veterans groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars won their campaign to transform their benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode the President s veto and passed the Bonus Act in January1936      It pumped sums equal to 2  of the GDP into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect     Roosevelt also kept his promise to push for repeal of Prohibition   On March23  1933  he signed the CullenHarrison Act redefining 3 2  alcohol as the maximum allowed  That act was preceded by Congressional action in the drafting and passage of the 21st Amendment   which was ratified later that year     After the 1934 Congressional elections  which gave Roosevelt large majorities in both houses  his administration drafted a fresh surge of New Deal legislation  These measures included the Works Progress Administration  WPA   which set up a national relief agency that employed two million family heads  At the height of WPA employment in 1938  unemployment was down from 20 6  in 1933 to only 12 5   according to figures from Michael Darby    The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly  the poor and the sick  Senator Robert Wagner wrote the Wagner Act   which officially became the National Labor Relations Act   The act established the federal rights of workers to organize unions  to engage in collective bargaining   and to take part in strikes   While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors  the Second New Deal challenged the business community  Conservative Democrats  led by Al Smith   fought back with the American Liberty League   savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him with Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin     But Smith overplayed his hand  and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the New Deal  strengthening Roosevelt for the 1936 landslide    By contrast  the labor unions  energized by the Wagner Act  signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt s reelections in 1936  1940 and 1944     Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen disagree with the prevailing belief that there were two New Deals in the Roosevelt administration    They argue that there is no evidence of any such blueprint for Roosevelt s programs  and that abundant evidence shows FDR s policies were formulated and executed haphazardly  fluctuating in the hands of a revolving cast of presidential advisors    Biographer James M  Burns suggests that Roosevelt s policy decisions were guided more by pragmatism than ideology  and that he  was like the general of a guerrilla army whose columns  fighting blindly in the mountains through dense ravines and thickets  suddenly converge  half by plan and half by coincidence  and debouch into the plain below     Roosevelt argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary   The country needs and  unless I mistake its temper  the country demands bold  persistent experimentation   he wrote   It is common sense to take a method and try it  if it fails  admit it frankly and try another  But above all  try something      Government spending increased from 8 0  of gross national product  GNP  under Hoover in 1932 to 10 2  of the GNP in 1936  The national debt as a percentage of the GNP had more than doubled under Hoover from 16  to 40  of the GNP in early 1933  It held steady at close to 40  as late as fall 1941  then grew rapidly during the war     Deficit spending had been recommended by some economists  most notably by John Maynard Keynes of Britain  The GNP was 34  higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58  higher in 1940 on the eve of war  That is  the economy grew 58  from 1932 to 1940 in 8 years of peacetime  and then grew 56  from 1940 to 1945 in 5 years of wartime     Unemployment fell dramatically in Roosevelt s first term  from 25  when he took office to 14 3  in 1937  However  it increased slightly to 19 0  in 1938   a depression within a depression   and fell to 17 2  in 1939  and then dropped again to 14 6  in 1940 until it reached 1 9  in 1945 during World War II    Total employment during Roosevelt s term expanded by 18 31million jobs  with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 5 3       Roosevelt considered his New Deal policies as central to his legacy  and in his 1944 State of the Union Address   he advocated that Americans should think of basic economic rights as a Second Bill of Rights    Roosevelt did not raise income taxes before World War II began  however payroll taxes were introduced to fund the new Social Security program in 1937  He also convinced Congress to spend more on many various programs never before seen in American history  Under the revenue pressures brought on by the depression  most states added or increased taxes  including sales as well as income taxes  Roosevelt s proposal for new taxes on corporate savings were highly controversial in 193637  and were rejected by Congress  During the war he pushed for even higher income tax rates for individuals  reaching a marginal tax rate of 91   and corporations and a cap on high salaries for executives  He also issued Executive Order 9250 in October1942  later to be rescinded by Congress  which raised the marginal tax rate for salaries exceeding  25 000  after tax  to 100   thereby limiting salaries to  25 000  about  361 000 today         To fund the war  Congress not only broadened the base so that almost every employee paid federal income taxes  but also introduced withholding taxes in 1943   The rejection of the League of Nations treaty in 1919 marked the dominance of isolationism from world organizations in American foreign policy  Despite Roosevelt s Wilsonian background  he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment  Roosevelt s  bombshell  message to the world monetary conference in 1933 effectively ended any major efforts by the world powers to collaborate on ending the worldwide depression  and allowed Roosevelt a free hand in economic policy    Roosevelt was a lifelong free trader and anti imperialist  Ending European colonialism was one of his objectives     The main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt s first term was the Good Neighbor Policy   which was a re evaluation of U S  policy towards Latin America   Since the Monroe Doctrine of 1823  this area had been seen as an American sphere of influence   American forces were withdrawn from Haiti  and new treaties with Cuba and Panama ended their status as U S  protectorates   In December1933  Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States  renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries     The isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid 1930s by U S  Senator Gerald Nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the  merchants of death  in the U S  from selling arms abroad    This effort took the form of the Neutrality Acts   the president asked for  but was refused  a provision to give him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression    In the interim  Italy under Benito Mussolini proceeded to overcome Ethiopia   and the Italians joined Nazi Germany in supporting the General Franco and the Nationalist cause in the Spanish Civil War     In 1936 Germany and Japan signed a Anti Comintern Pact   but they never coordinated their strategies    Congress passed  and the president signed  a mandatory arms embargo at a time when dictators in Europe and Asia were girding for world war     In the 1936 presidential election   Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs against Kansas Governor Alf Landon   who accepted much of the New Deal but objected that it was hostile to business and involved too much waste  Roosevelt and Garner won 60 8  of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont     The New Deal Democrats won even larger majorities in Congress  Roosevelt was backed by a coalition of voters which included traditional Democrats across the country  small farmers  the   Solid South    mostly white Democrats   Catholics  big city political machines  labor unions  northern African Americans  southern ones were still disfranchised   Jews  intellectuals and political liberals  This coalition  frequently referred to as the New Deal coalition   remained largely intact for the Democratic Party until the 1960s    Roosevelt s popularity generated massive volumes of correspondence that had to be responded to  He once told his son James   Two short sentences will generally answer any known letter      In contrast to his first term  little major legislation was passed during Roosevelt s second term  There was the Housing Act of 1937   a second Agricultural Adjustment Act  and the Fair Labor Standards Act  FLSA  of 1938  which created the minimum wage   When the economy began to deteriorate again in late 1937  Roosevelt asked Congress for  5billion in WPA relief and public works funding  This managed to eventually create as many as 3 3 million WPA jobs by 1938  Projects accomplished under the WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices  to facilities and infrastructure for national parks  bridges and other infrastructure across the country  and architectural surveys and archeological excavations investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources  Beyond this  however  Roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act  administrative reorganization and regional planning measures  which were leftovers from a regular session  According to Burns  this attempt illustrated Roosevelt s inability to decide on a basic economic program     The Supreme Court became Roosevelt s primary focus during his second term  after the court overturned many of his programs  In particular in 1935  the Court unanimously ruled that the National Recovery Act  NRA  was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the president  Roosevelt stunned Congress in early 1937 by proposing a law to allow him to appoint up to six new justices  what he referred to as a  persistent infusion of new blood     This   court packing   plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party  led by Vice President Garner  since it upset the separation of powers and gave the President control over the Court  Roosevelt s proposal to expand the court failed    but by 1941  Roosevelt had appointed eight of the nine justices of the court  a change in membership which resulted in a court that began to ratify his policies       Roosevelt at first had massive support from the rapidly growing labor unions  but they split into bitterly feuding AFL and CIO factions  the latter led by John L  Lewis   Roosevelt pronounced a  plague on both your houses   but labor s disunity weakened the party in the elections from 1938 through 1946     Determined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in Congress  mostly from the South   Roosevelt became involved in the 1938 Democratic primaries  actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform  His targets denounced Roosevelt for trying to take over the Democratic party and to win reelection  using the argument that they were independent  Roosevelt failed badly  managing to defeat only one target  a conservative Democrat from New York City      In the November1938 election  Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats  Losses were concentrated among pro New Deal Democrats  When Congress reconvened in 1939  Republicans under Senator Robert Taft formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats  virtually ending Roosevelt s ability to get his domestic proposals enacted into law  The minimum wage law of 1938 was the last substantial New Deal reform act passed by Congress    Following the autumn Congressional elections in 1938  Congress was now dominated by conservatives  many of whom feared that Roosevelt was  aiming at a dictatorship   according to the historian Hugh Brogan    In addition  as noted by another historian  after the 1938 election increased the strength of Republicans   Roosevelt had always belonged to the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party  He sought a realignment that would solidify liberal dominance by means of landslides in 1932  1934 and 1936  During the 1932 campaign he predicted privately   I ll be in the White House for eight years  When those years are over  there ll be a Progressive party  It may not be Democratic  but it will be Progressive   When the third consecutive landslide in 1936 failed to produce major legislation in 1937  his recourse was to purge his conservative opponents in 1938     The aggressive foreign policy of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler in Germany after 1933 aroused fears of a new world war  Americans wanted to keep out of it and in 1937 Congress passed an even more stringent Neutrality act  But when Japan invaded China in 1937  public opinion strongly favored China  and Roosevelt found various ways to assist that nation     In October 1937  Roosevelt gave the Quarantine Speech aiming to contain aggressor nations  He proposed that warmongering states be treated as a public health menace and be  quarantined     Meanwhile  he secretly stepped up a program to build long range submarines that could blockade Japan     At the time of the Munich Agreement in 1938 with the U S  not represented Roosevelt said the country would not join a  stop Hitler bloc  under any circumstances  He made it quite clear that  in the event of German aggression against Czechoslovakia  the U S  would remain neutral      Roosevelt said in 1939 that France and Britain were America s  first line of defense  and needed American aid  but because of widespread isolationist sentiment  he reiterated the US itself would not go to war    In the spring of 1939  Roosevelt allowed the French to place huge orders with the American aircraft industry on a cash and carry basis  as allowed by law  Most of the aircraft ordered had not arrived in France by the time of its collapse in May1940  so Roosevelt arranged in June 1940 for French orders to be sold to the British     When World War II began in September 1939 with Germany s invasion of Poland  Roosevelt rejected the Wilsonian neutrality stance and sought ways to assist Britain and France militarily    At first he gave only covert support to repeal of the arms embargo provisions of the Neutrality Act    He began a regular secret correspondence with the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill in September1939 the first of 1 700 letters and telegrams between them    discussing ways of supporting Britain  Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Churchill  who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in May 1940   His relations with Charles de Gaulle   leader of Free France   were more strained  for a long time he refused to recognize de Gaulle as the representative of France  preferring to deal with representatives of the Vichy government   Roosevelt did not recognize de Gaulle s provisional government until late 1944     In April 1940  Germany invaded Denmark and Norway  followed by invasions of the Netherlands  Belgium  Luxembourg and France in May  The German victories left Britain isolated in western Europe  Roosevelt  who was determined that Britain not be defeated  took advantage of the rapid shifts of public opinion  The fall of Paris shocked American opinion  and isolationist sentiment declined  A consensus was clear that military spending had to be dramatically expanded  There was no consensus on how much the US should risk war in helping Britain    In July1940  FDR appointed two interventionist Republican leaders  Henry L  Stimson and Frank Knox   as Secretaries of War and the Navy  respectively  Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build up the American military  but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany    Congress authorized the nation s first peacetime draft     Roosevelt used his personal charisma to build support for intervention  America should be the   Arsenal of Democracy    he told his fireside audience    On September2  1940  Roosevelt openly defied the Neutrality Acts by passing the Destroyers for Bases Agreement   which  in exchange for military base rights in the British Caribbean Islands  gave 50 WWI American destroyers to Britain  The U S  also received free base rights in Bermuda and Newfoundland   allowing British forces to be moved to the sharper end of the war  the idea of an exchange of warships for bases such as these originated in the cabinet    Hitler and Mussolini responded to the deal by joining with Japan in the Tripartite Pact      The agreement with Britain was a precursor of the March1941 Lend Lease agreement  which began to direct massive military and economic aid to Britain  the Republic of China  and later the Soviet Union  For foreign policy advice  Roosevelt turned to Harry Hopkins   who became his chief wartime advisor  They sought innovative ways short of going to war to help Britain  whose financial resources were exhausted by the end of 1940    Congress  where isolationist sentiment was waning  passed the Lend Lease Act in March1941  allowing the U S  to give Wales  England  Scotland  China  and later the Soviet Union military supplies  The legislation had hit a logjam until Senators Byrd  Byrnes and Taft added a provision subjecting it to appropriation by Congress    Congress voted to commit to spend  50billion on military supplies from 1941 to 1945  In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I   there would be no repayment after the war  Until late in 1941  Roosevelt refused Churchill s urgent requests for armed escort of ships bound for Britain  insisting on a more passive patrolling function in the western Atlantic     The two term tradition had been an unwritten rule  until the 22nd Amendment after Roosevelt s presidency  since George Washington declined to run for a third term in 1796  Both Ulysses S  Grant and Theodore Roosevelt were attacked for trying to obtain a third non consecutive term  Roosevelt systematically undercut prominent Democrats who were angling for the nomination  including Vice President John Nance Garner   and two cabinet members  Secretary of State Cordell Hull and James Farley   Roosevelt s campaign manager in 1932 and 1936  the Postmaster General and the Democratic Party chairman  Roosevelt moved the convention to Chicago where he had strong support from the city machine  which controlled the auditorium sound system   At the convention the opposition was poorly organized  but Farley had packed the galleries  Roosevelt sent a message saying that he would not run unless he was drafted  and that the delegates were free to vote for anyone  The delegates were stunned  then the loudspeaker screamed  We want Roosevelt    The world wants Roosevelt   The delegates went wild and he was nominated by 946 to 147 on the first ballot  The tactic employed by Roosevelt was not entirely successful  as his goal had been to be drafted by acclamation    The new vice presidential nominee was Henry Agard Wallace   a liberal intellectual who was Secretary of Agriculture     In his campaign against Republican Wendell Willkie   Roosevelt stressed both his proven leadership experience and his intention to do everything possible to keep the United States out of war  In one of his speeches he declared to potential recruits that  you boys are not going to be sent into any foreign war     He won the 1940 election with 55  of the popular vote and 38 of the 48 states  and thus winning almost 85  of the electoral vote  449 to 82     A shift to the left within the Administration was shown by the naming of Henry A  Wallace as Vice President in place of the conservative Texan John Nance Garner  who had become a bitter enemy of Roosevelt after 1937   Roosevelt tried to avoid repeating what he saw as Woodrow Wilson s mistakes in World War I    He often made exactly the opposite decision  Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed  while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China  Unlike the loans in World War I  the United States made large scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through Lend Lease   with little expectation of repayment  Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war  Roosevelt did  Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft  Roosevelt started one in 1940  Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did  Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did  Wilson proclaimed independent policy  as seen in the 14 Points  while Roosevelt always had a collaborative policy with the Allies  In 1917  United States declared war on Germany  in 1941  Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor  Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans  Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department  Wilson let General George Pershing make the major military decisions  Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war  He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender  Roosevelt often mentioned his role in the Wilson administration  but added that he had profited more from Wilson s errors than from his successes           Roosevelt s third term was dominated by World War II  Roosevelt slowly began re armament in 1938  although he was facing strong isolationist sentiment from leaders like Senators William Borah and Robert A  Taft   By 1940  re armament was in high gear  with bipartisan support  partly to expand and re equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the  Arsenal of Democracy  supporting Britain  France  China and  after June1941   the Soviet Union    As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against the Axis Powers   American isolationists  including Charles Lindbergh and America First   vehemently attacked the President as an irresponsible warmonger    Roosevelt initiated FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigations of his loudest critics  though no legal actions resulted    Unfazed by these criticisms and confident in the wisdom of his foreign policy initiatives  FDR continued his twin policies of preparedness and aid to the Allied coalition  On December29  1940  he delivered his Arsenal of Democracy fireside chat  in which he made the case for involvement in the war directly to the American people  A week later he delivered his famous Four Freedoms speech laying out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world   The homefront was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war  though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt s most urgent policy concern  The military buildup spurred economic growth  Unemployment fell in half from 7 7 million in spring 1940  when the first accurate statistics were compiled  to 3 4 million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1 5 million in fall 1942  out of a labor force of 54 million    c   There was a growing labor shortage  accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans  farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers  African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry  To pay for increased government spending  in 1941 FDR proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99 5  on all income over  100 000  when the proposal failed  he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100  on income over  25 000  which Congress rescinded     When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June1941  Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend Lease to the Soviets  Thus  Roosevelt had committed the U S  to the Allied side with a policy of  all aid short of war     Execution of the aid fell victim to foot dragging in the administration so FDR appointed a special assistant  Wayne Coy  to expedite matters    Later that year a German submarine fired on the U S  destroyer Greer  and Roosevelt declared that the U S  Navy would assume an escort role for Allied convoys in the Atlantic as far east as Great Britain and would fire upon German ships or submarines   U boats   of the Kriegsmarine if they entered the U S  Navy zone  This  shoot on sight  policy effectively declared Naval war on Germany and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2 to 1     Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a highly secret bilateral meeting in Argentia  Newfoundland  and on August14  1941  drafted the Atlantic Charter   conceptually outlining global wartime and postwar goals  All the Allies endorsed it  This was the first of several wartime conferences     Churchill and Roosevelt would meet ten more times in person    In July1941  Roosevelt had ordered Secretary of War Henry Stimson   to begin planning for total American military involvement  The resulting  Victory Program  provided the Army s estimates necessary for the total mobilization of manpower  industry  and logistics to defeat Germany and Japan  The program also planned to dramatically increase aid to the Allied nations and to have ten million men in arms  half of whom would be ready for deployment abroad in 1943  Roosevelt was firmly committed to the Allied cause and these plans had been formulated before Japan s Attack on Pearl Harbor      Congress was debating a modification of the Neutrality Act in October1941  when the USS Kearny   along with other ships  engaged a number of U boats south of Iceland  the Kearny took fire and lost eleven crewmen  As a result  the amendment of the Neutrality Act to permit the arming of the merchant marine passed both houses  though by a slim margin     In 1942  war production increased dramatically  but fell short of the goals established by the President  due in part to manpower shortages    The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes by union workers  especially in the coal mining and railroad industries  which lasted well into 1944      The White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation  conciliation or arbitration    One particular battle royal occurred  between Vice President Wallace  who headed the Board of Economic Warfare   and Jesse Jones  in charge of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation   both agencies assumed responsibility for acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding  FDR resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies     In 1944  the President requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all unreasonable profits  both corporate and individual  and thereby support his declared need for over  10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures  The Congress passed a revenue bill raising  2 billion  which FDR vetoed  though Congress in turn overrode him     When Japan occupied northern French Indochina in late 1940  FDR authorized increased aid to the Republic of China   a policy that won widespread popular support  In July1941  after Japan occupied the remainder of Indo China  he cut off the sale of oil to Japan  which thus lost more than 95 percent of its oil supply  Roosevelt continued negotiations with the Japanese government  primarily through Secretary Hull  Japan Premier Fumimaro Konoye desired a summit conference with FDR which the US rejected  Konoye was replaced with Minister of War Hideki Tojo     Meanwhile  Roosevelt started sending long range B 17 bombers to the Philippines   FDR felt that an attack by the Japanese was probable most likely in the Dutch East Indies or Thailand    On December4  1941  The Chicago Tribune published the complete text of   Rainbow Five    a top secret war plan drawn up by the War Department  It dealt chiefly with mobilization issues  calling for a 10 million man army   The great majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy thesis that Roosevelt  or any other high government officials  knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded  Senior American officials were aware that war was imminent  but they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor     On the morning of December7  1941  the Japanese struck the U S  naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack   knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2 403 American servicemen and civilians  Roosevelt called for war in his famous   Infamy Speech   to Congress  in which he said   Yesterday  December7  1941 a date which will live in infamy the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan    In 1942 Roosevelt set up a new military command structure with Admiral Ernest J  King as Chief of Naval Operations in complete control of the Navy and Marines  General George C  Marshall in charge of the Army and in nominal control of the Air Force  which in practice was commanded by General Hap Arnold   Roosevelt formed a new body  the Joint Chiefs of Staff   which made the final decisions on American military strategy    The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency and was chaired by Admiral William D  Leahy   When dealing with Europe  the Joint Chiefs met with their British counterparts and formed the Combined Chiefs of Staff       pageneeded   Unlike the political leaders of the other major powers  Roosevelt rarely overrode his military advisors      pageneeded   His civilian appointees handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment  but no civilians not even the secretaries of War or Navy  had a voice in strategy    d   Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high level diplomacy through his aides  especially Harry Hopkins   Since Hopkins also controlled  50 billion in Lend Lease funds given to the Allies  they paid attention to him      pageneeded    After Pearl Harbor  antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight  On December11  1941  Germany and Italy declared war on the United States  which responded in kind    Roosevelt and his military advisers implemented a war strategy with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa  launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts  and saving China and defeating Japan  Public opinion  however  gave priority to the destruction of Japan  so American forces were sent chiefly to the Pacific in 1942     In the opening weeks of the war  Japan had conquered the Philippines   and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia   capturing Singapore in February1942  Furthermore  Japan cut off the overland supply route to China   Roosevelt met with Churchill in late December and planned a broad informal alliance among the U S   Britain  China and the Soviet Union  This included Churchill s initial plan to invade North Africa  called Operation Gymnast   and the primary plan of the U S  generals for a western Europe invasion  focused directly on Germany   Operation Sledgehammer    An agreement was also reached for a centralized command and offensive in the Pacific theater called ABDA  American  British  Dutch  Australian  to save China and defeat Japan  Nevertheless  the Atlantic First strategy was intact  to Churchill s great satisfaction    On New Year s Day 1942  Churchill and FDR issued the  Declaration by United Nations   representing 26 countries in opposition to the Tripartite Pact of Germany  Italy and Japan     When the war began  the danger of a Japanese attack on the coast led to growing pressure to move people of Japanese descent away from the coastal region  This pressure grew due to fears of terrorism  espionage  and or sabotage  it was also related to anti Japanese competition and discrimination  On February19  1942  President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066   which relocated hundreds of thousands of the  Issei   first generation of Japanese immigrants who did not have U S  citizenship  and their children   Nisei   who had dual citizenship   They were forced to give up their properties and businesses  and transported to hastily built camps in interior  harsh locations   After both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States in December1941  many German and Italian citizens who had not taken out American citizenship were arrested or interned     The  Big Three   Roosevelt  Churchill  and Joseph Stalin    together with Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek   cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West  Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front   and Chinese  British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific  The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high profile conferences as well as contact through diplomatic and military channels  Roosevelt guaranteed that the U S  would be the  Arsenal of Democracy  by shipping  50billion of Lend Lease supplies  primarily to Britain and to the USSR  China and other Allies   In October1942  the President was advised that military resources were desperately needed at Guadalcanal to prevent overrunning by the Japanese  FDR heeded the advice  redirected armaments and the Japanese Pacific offensive was stalled     The Allies undertook the invasions of French Morocco and Algeria   Operation Torch   in November1942  FDR very much desired the assault be initiated before election day  but did not order it  FDR and Churchill had another war conference in Casablanca in January1943  Stalin declined an invitation  The Allies agreed strategically that the Mediterranean focus be continued  with the cross channel invasion coming later  followed by concentration of efforts in the Pacific    Roosevelt also championed General Henri Giraud as leader of Free France against General Charles de Gaulle     Hitler reinforced his military in North Africa  with the result that the Allied efforts there suffered a temporary setback  Allied attempts to counterbalance this were successful  but resulted in war supplies to the USSR being delayed  as well as the second war front    Later  their assault pursued into Sicily   Operation Husky   followed in July1943  and of Italy   Operation Avalanche   in September1943  In 1943  it was apparent to FDR that Stalin  while bearing the brunt of Germany s offensive  had not had sufficient opportunity to participate in war conferences  The President made a concerted effort to arrange a one on one meeting with Stalin  in Fairbanks  However  when Stalin learned that Roosevelt and Churchill had postponed the cross channel invasion a second time  he cancelled    The strategic bombing campaign was escalated in 1944  pulverizing all major German cities and cutting off oil supplies  It was a 5050 British American operation  Roosevelt picked Dwight D  Eisenhower   and not George Marshall   to head the Allied cross channel invasion  Operation Overlord that began on D Day   June6  1944  Some of the most costly battles of the war ensued after the invasion  and the Allies were blocked on the German border in the   Battle of the Bulge   in December1944  When Roosevelt died on April12  1945  Allied forces were closing in on Berlin   Meanwhile  in the Pacific  the Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June1942  when the U S  Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway   American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly progress called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands  with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded  In contrast to Hitler  Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations  though he approved strategic decisions    FDR gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan  he always insisted on Germany first   By late 1943  it was apparent that the Allies would ultimately defeat the enemy  so it became increasingly important to make high level political decisions about the course of the war and the postwar future of Europe  Roosevelt met with Churchill and the Chinese leader Chiang Kai shek at the Cairo Conference in November1943  and then went to the Tehran Conference to confer with Churchill and Stalin  While Churchill warned of potential domination by a Stalin dictatorship over eastern Europe  Roosevelt responded with a statement summarizing his rationale for relations with Stalin   I just have a hunch that Stalin is not that kind of a man      I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return  noblesse oblige  he won t try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace     At the Tehran Conference   Roosevelt and Churchill discussed plans for a postwar international organization  For his part  Stalin insisted on redrawing the frontiers of Poland  Stalin supported Roosevelt s plan for the United Nations and promised to enter the war against Japan 90 days after Germany was defeated   By the beginning of 1945  however  with the Allied armies advancing into Germany and the Soviets in control of Poland  the postwar issues came into the open  In February  Roosevelt traveled to Yalta  in Crimea  to meet again with Stalin and Churchill  While Roosevelt maintained his confidence that Stalin would keep his Yalta promises regarding free elections in eastern Europe  one month after Yalta ended  Roosevelt s Ambassador to the USSR Averell Harriman cabled Roosevelt that  we must come clearly to realize that the Soviet program is the establishment of totalitarianism  ending personal liberty and democracy as we know it     Two days later  Roosevelt began to admit that his view of Stalin had been excessively optimistic and that  Averell is right      Roosevelt  who was a chain smoker      had been in declining health since at least 1940  and by 1944 he was noticeably fatigued  In March1944  shortly after his 62nd birthday  he underwent testing at Bethesda Hospital and was found to have high blood pressure   atherosclerosis   coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris   and congestive heart failure         Hospital physicians and two outside specialists ordered Roosevelt to rest  His personal physician  Admiral Ross McIntire  created a daily schedule that banned business guests for lunch and incorporated two hours of rest each day  During the 1944 election campaign  McIntire denied several times that Roosevelt s health was poor  on October12  for example  he announced that  The President s health is perfectly OK  There are absolutely no organic difficulties at all     Prior to the election  Roosevelt may have used his authority over the Office of Censorship to quash press reports of his declining physical health     Roosevelt  aware that most publishers were opposed to him  issued a decree in 1943 that blocked all publishers and media executives from visits to combat areas  he put General Marshall in charge of enforcement  The main target was Henry Luce   the powerful publisher of Time and Life magazines  Historian Alan Brinkley argues the move was  badly mistaken   for had Luce been allowed to travel  he would have been an enthusiastic cheerleader for American forces around the globe  But stranded in New York City  Luce s frustration and anger expressed itself in hard edged partisanship     Party leaders insisted that Roosevelt drop Henry A  Wallace   who had been erratic as Vice President and was too pro Soviet  James F  Byrnes of South Carolina  a top FDR aide  was considered ineligible because he had left the Catholic Church and many Catholic voters would not vote for him  Roosevelt replaced Wallace with Missouri Senator Harry S  Truman   best known for his battle against corruption and inefficiency in wartime spending  The Republicans nominated Thomas E  Dewey   the liberal governor of New York  The opposition lambasted FDR and his administration for domestic corruption  bureaucratic inefficiency  tolerance of Communism  and military blunders  Labor unions  which had grown rapidly in the war  threw their all out support behind Roosevelt  Roosevelt and Truman won the 1944 election by a comfortable margin  defeating the Dewey and his running mate John W  Bricker with 53 4  of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes      pageneeded   The President campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations  so his victory symbolized support for the nation s future participation in the international community     Due to the President s health and the ongoing state of war  the President s fourth inauguration on January 20  1945  was held on the White House lawn     The President left the Yalta Conference on February12  1945  flew to Egypt and boarded the USS Quincy operating on the Great Bitter Lake near the Suez Canal   Aboard Quincy   the next day he met with Farouk I   king of Egypt  and Haile Selassie   emperor of Ethiopia  On February14  he held a historic meeting with King Abdulaziz   the founder of Saudi Arabia  a meeting some historians believe holds profound significance in U S  Saudi relations even today    After a final meeting between Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill   Quincy steamed for Algiers  arriving February18  at which time Roosevelt conferred with American ambassadors to Britain  France and Italy    At Yalta  Lord Moran   Winston Churchill s physician  commenting on Roosevelt s ill health  said that he was a dying man     When Roosevelt returned to the United States  he addressed Congress on March1 about the Yalta Conference    and many were shocked to see how old  thin and frail he looked  He spoke while seated in the well of the House  an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity  Roosevelt opened his speech by saying   I hope that you will pardon me for this unusual posture of sitting down during the presentation of what I want to say  but    it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs   Still in full command mentally  he firmly stated  The Crimean Conference ought to spell the end of a system of unilateral action  the exclusive alliances  the spheres of influence  the balances of power  and all the other expedients that have been tried for centuries and have always failed  We propose to substitute for all these  a universal organization in which all peace loving nations will finally have a chance to join      During March1945  he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland  Germany  prisoners of war and other issues  When Stalin accused the western Allies of plotting a separate peace with Hitler behind his back  Roosevelt replied   I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers  whoever they are  for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates      On March29  1945  Roosevelt went to the Little White House at Warm Springs  Georgia   to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations   On the afternoon of April12  Roosevelt said   I have a terrific pain in the back of my head   He then slumped forward in his chair  unconscious  and was carried into his bedroom  The president s attending cardiologist  Dr  Howard Bruenn  diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage  stroke     At 3 35p m  that day  Roosevelt died  As Allen Drury later said   so ended an era  and so began another   After Roosevelt s death  an editorial by The New York Times declared   Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin D  Roosevelt was in the White House      At the time he collapsed  Roosevelt had been sitting for a portrait painting by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff   known as the famous Unfinished Portrait of FDR    In his later years at the White House  when Roosevelt was increasingly overworked  his daughter Anna Roosevelt Boettiger had moved in to provide her father companionship and support  Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress  the now widowed Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd   Shoumatoff  who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer  rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity   On the morning of April13  Roosevelt s body was placed in a flag draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train  After a White House funeral on April14  Roosevelt was transported back to Hyde Park by train  As was his wish  Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of the Springwood estate   the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park on April15  Eleanor  who died in November1962  was buried next to him   Roosevelt s death was met with shock and grief   across the US and around the world  His declining health had not been known to the general public   Less than a month after his death  on May8  the war in Europe ended  President Harry S  Truman dedicated Victory in Europe Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt s memory  and kept the flags across the U S  at half staff for the remainder of the 30 day mourning period  saying that his only wish was  that Franklin D  Roosevelt had lived to witness this day      President Roosevelt appointed eight Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States   more than any other President except George Washington  who appointed ten  By 1941  eight of the nine Justices were Roosevelt appointees  Harlan Fiske Stone was elevated to Chief Justice from the position of Associate Justice by Roosevelt   Roosevelt s appointees would not share ideologies  and some  like Hugo Black and Felix Frankfurter  would become  lifelong adversaries     Frankfurter even labeled his more liberal colleagues Rutledge  Murphy  Black  and Douglas as part of an  Axis  of opposition to his judicial restraint agenda     Roosevelt was a hero to major minority groups  especially African Americans  Catholics  and Jews  and was highly successful in attracting large majorities of these voters into his New Deal coalition     He won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans  but not Japanese Americans  as he was responsible for their losses due to internship in concentration camps during the war    Roosevelt s understanding and awareness of problems in the world of the American Indians was questioned during the Hopi Hearings which were held in 1955   African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs  the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Indian Reorganization Act   respectively  Sitkoff reported that the WPA  provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s  rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source  of income     Another significant change was establishment in 1941 of the Fair Employment Practices Committee   to implement Executive Order 8802 prohibiting racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors  This was the first national program directed against employment discrimination  African Americans who gained defense industry jobs in the 1940s shared in the higher wages  in the 1950s they had gained in relative economic position  about 14  higher than other blacks who were not in such industries  Their moves into manufacturing positions was critical to their success     Roosevelt needed the support of the powerful white Southern Democrats for his New Deal programs  and blacks were still disenfranchised in the South  He decided against pushing for federal anti  lynching legislation  It was not likely to pass and the political fight might threaten his ability to pass his highest priority programsthough he did denounce lynchings as  a vile form of collective murder     The frequency of lynchings had declined since the early decades of the century  in part due to the African Americans  Great Migration out of the South  millions were still leaving it behind   Historian Kevin J  McMahon claims that strides were made for the civil rights of African Americans  In Roosevelt s Justice Department  the Civil Rights Section worked closely with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  NAACP   Roosevelt worked with other civil rights groups on cases dealing with police brutality  lynching  and voting rights abuses     Beginning in the 1960s  FDR was charged       with not acting decisively enough to prevent or stop the Holocaust     Critics cite instances such as the 1939 episode in which 936 Jewish refugees on the SS St  Louis were denied asylum and not allowed into the United States because of strict laws passed by Congress     The issue of desegregating the armed forces did not arise  but in 1940 Roosevelt appointed former federal judge William H  Hastie   an African American  to be a civilian aide to Secretary of War Henry L  Stimson    On the home front on June 25  1941  Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802   forbidding discrimination on account of  race  creed  color  or national origin  in the hiring of workers in defense related industries    This was a precursor to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to come decades later     Enemy aliens and people of Japanese ancestry fared badly  On February 19  1942  Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 that applied to everyone classified as an  enemy alien   including people who had dual citizenship living in designated high risk areas that covered most of the cities on the West Coast    With the U S  at war with Italy  some 600 000 Italian aliens  citizens of Italy who did not have U S  citizenship  were subjected to strict travel restrictions  the restrictions were lifted in October 1942     Some 120 000 people of Japanese ancestry were forced to leave the West Coast  From 1942 to 1945  they lived in internment camps inland  Those outside the West Coast  and in Hawaii   were not affected   During his presidency  and continuing to a lesser extent today  there has been much criticism of Roosevelt  some of it intense  Critics have questioned not only his policies and positions   consolidation of power that occurred due to his responses to the crises of the Depression  and World War  but also his breaking with tradition by running for a third term as president     By the middle of his second term  much criticism of Roosevelt centered on fears that he was heading toward a dictatorship  by attempting to seize control of the Supreme Court in the Court packing incident of 1937  by attempting to eliminate dissent within the Democratic party in the South during the 1938 elections  and by breaking the tradition established by George Washington of not seeking a third term when he again ran for re election in 1940  As two historians explain   In 1940  with the two term issue as a weapon  anti New Dealers   argued that the time had come to disarm the  dictator  and to dismantle the machinery      As President  Roosevelt was hit from both the right and the left  He came under attack for his supposed anti business policies  for being a  warmonger   for being a  Fascist  and for being too friendly to Joseph Stalin   Long after his death new lines of attack criticized his policies regarding helping the Jews of Europe    incarcerating the Japanese on the West Coast    and opposing anti lynching legislation     A majority of polls rank Roosevelt as the second or third greatest president   consistent with other surveys        Roosevelt is the sixth most admired person from the 20th century by U S  citizens  according to Gallup     Roosevelt was also widely beloved for his role in repealing Prohibition     The rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during Roosevelt s term redefined the role of the government in the United States  and Roosevelt s advocacy of government social programs was instrumental in redefining liberalism for coming generations     Roosevelt firmly established the United States  leadership role on the world stage  with his role in shaping and financing World War II  His isolationist critics faded away  and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies    After his death  his widow continued to be a forceful presence in US and world politics  serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally  Many members of his administration played leading roles in the administrations of Truman  Kennedy and Johnson   each of whom embraced Roosevelt s political legacy     Reflecting on Roosevelt s presidency   which brought the United States through the Great Depression and World War II to a prosperous future   said FDR s biographer Jean Edward Smith in 2007   He lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees      Both during and after his terms  critics of Roosevelt questioned not only his policies and positions   but even more so the consolidation of power in the White House at a time when dictators were taking over Europe and Asia    Many of the New Deal programs were abolished during the war by FDR s opponents  The powerful new wartime agencies were set up to be temporary and expire at war s end     Roosevelt s home in Hyde Park is now a National Historic Site and home to his Presidential library   His retreat at Warm Springs  Georgia is a museum operated by the state of Georgia  His summer retreat on Campobello Island is maintained by the governments of both Canada and the United States as Roosevelt Campobello International Park   the island is accessible by way of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge    Washington D C  hosts two memorials to the former president  The largest  the 7 50 acre Roosevelt Memorial   is located next to the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin   A much more modest memorial  a block of marble in front of the National Archives building  was erected in 1955 and adheres to President Roosevelt s explicit suggestion as to what his memorial should be   Three public sculptures of Roosevelt sitting in a wheelchair are known to exist  Two are at the Roosevelt Memorial  one of FDR sitting in a chair with small wheels mostly obscured by his cape  another of FDR in a wheelchair at the entrance to the memorial    a third statue  unveiled in April2008  is part of the  Paseo de los Presidentes  on the south side of Puerto Rico  s Capitol Building  which honors the nine presidents who have visited the US territory while in office        Another statue is installed at the Franklin D  Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island    Roosevelt s leadership in the March of Dimes is one reason he is commemorated on the American dime        Many parks and schools  as well as an aircraft carrier and a Paris subway station and hundreds of streets and squares both across the U S  and the rest of the world have been named in his honor   Roosevelt was a strong supporter of scouting   beginning in 1915   Roosevelt was honored by the United States Postal Service with a Prominent Americans series 6 postage stamp   issue of 1966  He also appears on several other U S  Postage stamps     Roosevelt was a devoted philatelist from the age of ten  spending some time almost every day with his collection of 1 25 million stamps  As president government agencies sent Roosevelt unusual stamps they received in the mail  and the hobby gave him an unusually thorough knowledge of world geography which benefited him during the war  After his death the collection was sold for  250 000  Among the items was a group of envelopes Roosevelt saved that he received as president  those with compliments were addressed  To the Greatest Man in the World  and  God s Gift to the U S A    while less favorable letters arrived in envelopes labeled  F D  Russianvelt  President of U S A   C I O       Benedict Arnold 2nd   and  Rattlesnake Roosevelt      The airport of the Dutch Caribbean island of St  Eustatius is named F D  Roosevelt Airport after Roosevelt  whose ancestors lived on the island in the 18th century  Most of the arms and supplies for General Washington s fight against the British came to North America through St  Eustatius  When in the port of the island in 1939  Roosevelt presented the inhabitants with a plaque commemorating that in 1776  Here the sovereignty of the United States of America was first formally acknowledged to a national vessel by a foreign official   the famous  First Salute   The plaque hangs on the flag pole of the island s Fort Oranje     citation needed    Age 11  1893  Age 18  Massachusetts  1900  Age 31  Assistant

Scholarly topical studies Primary sources    Thomas Woodrow Wilson  December28  1856  February3  1924  was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921  Born and raised in the South   Wilson earned a Ph D in political science  working as a professor and scholar at various institutions before being chosen as President of Princeton University   where he worked from 1902 to 1910  In the election of 1910  he was the gubernatorial candidate of New Jersey  s Democratic Party  and was elected the 34th Governor of New Jersey   serving from 1911 to 1913  Running for president in 1912   a split in the Republican Party allowed his plurality  just over forty percent  to win him a large electoral college margin  As President  Wilson was a leading force in the Progressive Movement   bolstered by his Democratic Party s winning control of both the White House and Congress in 1912   In office  Wilson reintroduced the spoken State of the Union   which had been out of use since 1801  Leading the Congress  now in Democratic hands  he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933    Included among these were the Federal Reserve Act   Federal Trade Commission Act   the Clayton Antitrust Act   and the Federal Farm Loan Act   Having taken office one month after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment   Wilson called a special session of Congress  whose work culminated in the Revenue Act of 1913   reintroducing an income tax and lowering tariffs  Through passage of the Adamson Act   imposing an 8 hour workday for railroads  he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis    Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914  Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality  while pursuing a more aggressive policy in dealing with Mexico s civil war    Wilson faced former United States Supreme Court associate justice Charles Evans Hughes of New York in the presidential elections of 1916   and became the first Democrat since Andrew Jackson elected to consecutive terms  He was narrowly re elected on the slogan   He kept us out of war   Wilson s second term  however  was dominated by American entry into World War I   In April 1917  when Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare  Wilson asked Congress to declare war in order to make  the world safe for democracy   The United States conducted military operations alongside the Allies  although without a formal alliance  During the war  Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations  leaving military strategy to the generals  especially General John J  Pershing   Loaning billions of dollars to Britain  France  and other Allies  the United States aided their finance of the war effort  Through the Selective Service Act   conscription sent 10 000 freshly trained soldiers to France  per day  by summer of 1918  On the home front  he raised income taxes  borrowing billions of dollars through the public s purchase of Liberty Bonds   He set up the War Industries Board   promoted labor union cooperation  regulating agriculture and food production through the Lever Act   and granting to the Secretary of the Treasury  William McAdoo   direct control of the nation s railroad system   In his 1915 State of the Union  Wilson asked Congress for what became the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918   suppressing anti war movements   His crackdown was intensified by his Attorney General A  Mitchell Palmer to include non citizen antiwar activists during the First Red Scare of 19191920  Following years of advocacy for suffrage on the state level  in 1918 he endorsed the Nineteenth Amendment whose ratification provided all women the right to vote by its ratification in 1920  over Southern opposition  Meanwhile  in the federal Civil Service   Wilson endorsed racial segregation   granting department heads greater autonomy in their management    Early in 1918  he issued his principles for peace  the Fourteen Points   and in 1919  following armistice   he traveled to Paris   promoting the formation of a League of Nations   concluding the Treaty of Versailles   Following his return from Europe  Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour in 1919 to campaign for the treaty  suffering a severe stroke  The treaty was met with serious concern by Senate Republicans  and Wilson rejected a compromise effort led by Henry Cabot Lodge   leading to the Senate s rejection of the treaty  Due to his stroke  Wilson secluded himself in the White House  disability having diminished his power and influence  Forming a strategy for reelection  Wilson deadlocked the 1920 Democratic National Convention   but his bid for a third term nomination was overlooked   A devoted Presbyterian  Wilson infused morality into his internationalism   an ideology now referred to as   Wilsonian   a contentious position of American foreign policy obligating the United States to promote global democracy        For his sponsorship of the League of Nations  Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize   the second of three sitting presidents so honored         Wilson was born in Staunton  Virginia   on December28  1856  at 1824 North Coalter Street  now the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library    of Scots Irish descent    He was the third of four children of Joseph Ruggles Wilson  18221903  and Jessie Janet Woodrow  18261888     Wilson s paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Strabane   County Tyrone   Ireland  now Northern Ireland    in 1807  His mother was born in Carlisle   Cumberland   England  the daughter of Rev  Dr  Thomas Woodrow from Paisley   Scotland  and Marion Williamson from Glasgow     This was one of the Border Counties  which supplied many immigrants to the North American colonies in the late 18th century   Joseph originally lived in Steubenville  Ohio   where his family had settled  Wilson s grandfather had published a pro tariff and anti slavery newspaper  The Western Herald and Gazette     Wilson s parents moved south in 1851 and came to fully identify with it  His father defended slavery   owned slaves and set up a Sunday school for them  Both parents identified with the Confederacy  they cared for wounded soldiers at their church  and Wilson s father briefly served as a chaplain to the Confederate Army     Woodrow Wilson s earliest memory  from the age of three  was of hearing that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming  Wilson would forever recall standing for a moment at General Robert E  Lee  s side and looking up into his face     Wilson s father was one of the founders of the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States  PCUS  in 1861 after it split from the northern Presbyterians  He served as the first permanent clerk of the southern church s General Assembly  was Stated Clerk from 1865 to 1898  and was Moderator of the PCUS General Assembly in 1879  He became minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Augusta  Georgia   and the family lived there until young Wilson was 14      Wilson in 1873 formally became a member of the Columbia First Presbyterian Church and remained a member throughout his life     Wilson s reading began at age ten  possibly delayed by dyslexia   he later blamed the lack of schools in the postbellum South  As a teen  he taught himself the Graham shorthand system to compensate  and achieved academically with self discipline  studying at home with his father  then in classes at a small Augusta school    During Reconstruction   Wilson lived in Columbia  South Carolina   from 1870 to 1874  while his father was professor at the Columbia Theological Seminary     His father moved the family to Wilmington  North Carolina   in 1874 where he was the minister at First Presbyterian Church until 1882  Wilson attended Davidson College in North Carolina for the 187374 school year  cut short by illness  then transferred to Princeton as a freshman when his father began teaching at the university  He graduated in 1879  a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity  In his second year  he studied political philosophy and history  was active in the Whig literary and debating society  and wrote for the Nassau Literary Review     He organized the Liberal Debating Society   and later coached the WhigClio Debate Panel     In the hotly contested election of 1876  Wilson declared his support for the Democratic Party and its nominee  Samuel J  Tilden      In 1879  Wilson attended law school at the University of Virginia for one year  he was involved in the Virginia Glee Club and was president of the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society     While there  he enjoyed frequent trips to his birthplace of Staunton  He visited with cousins  and fell in love with one  Hattie Woodrow  though his affections were unrequited     His health became frail and dictated withdrawal  so he went home to his parents  then living in Wilmington   North Carolina  where he continued his law studies    Wilson was admitted to the Georgia bar and made a brief attempt at law practice in January1882  he found legal history and substantive jurisprudence interesting  but abhorred the day to day procedural aspects  After less than a year  he abandoned the practice to pursue his study of political science and history  Both parents expressed concern over a potentially premature decision     In the fall of April1883  Wilson entered Johns Hopkins University to study history  political science and the German language    Three years later  he completed his doctoral dissertation  Congressional Government  A Study in American Politics     and received a Ph D     In late spring of 1883  Wilson was summoned to Rome  Georgia   to assist in the settlement of his maternal uncle William s estate  which was being mishandled by a brother in law  While there he met and fell in love with Ellen Louise Axson   the daughter of a minister from Savannah  Georgia   he proposed to her and they became engaged in Asheville     Wilson s marriage to Ellen was delayed by traumatic developments in her family  in late 1883  Ellen s father Edward  suffering from depression   was admitted to the Georgia State Mental Hospital  where in 1884 he committed suicide   After closing the family home in Rome  Georgia  and recovering from the initial shock  Ellen gained admission to the Art Students League of New York   After graduation  she pursued portrait art and received a medal for one of her works from the Paris International Exposition  She happily agreed to sacrifice further independent artistic pursuits in order to keep her marriage commitment  and in 1885 she and Wilson married     Wilson was an automobile enthusiast  and took daily rides while he was President in his favorite car  a 1919 Pierce Arrow     His enjoyment of motoring made him an advocate of funding for public highways     Wilson was an avid baseball fan  and in 1915 became the first sitting president to attend  and throw out the first ball at  a World Series game  Wilson had been a center fielder during his Davidson College days and was the Princeton team s assistant manager    He cycled regularly  taking several cycling vacations in the English Lake District     Wilson later took up golf     Wilson worked as a lecturer at Cornell University in 188687  where he joined the Irving Literary Society   He next taught at Bryn Mawr College from 1885 until 1888  teaching ancient Greek and Roman history  while there  he refused offers from the universities of Michigan and Indiana    When Ellen was pregnant with their first child in 1886  the couple decided that Ellen should go to her Aunt Louisa Brown s residence in Gainesville  Georgia   to have their first child  she arrived just one day before the baby  Margaret  was born in April1886  Their second child  Jessie  was born in August1887     In 1888  Wilson left Bryn Mawr for Wesleyan University   it was a controversial move  as he had signed a three year contract with Bryn Mawr in 1887  Both parties claimed contract violations and the matter subsided    At Wesleyan  he coached the football team and founded the debate team  which bears his name     In February1890  with the help of friends  Wilson was elected by the Princeton University board to the Chair of Jurisprudence and Political Economy  at an annual salary of  3000    He continued a previous practice of reserving time for a six week course in administration at Johns Hopkins    He was also a faculty member of the short lived coordinate college  Evelyn College for Women   Additionally  Wilson became the first lecturer of Constitutional Law at New York Law School   where he taught with Charles Evans Hughes     Representing the American Whig Society   Wilson delivered an oration at Princeton s sesquicentennial celebration  1896  entitled  Princeton in the Nation s Service   which was the origin for the school s motto    Wilson became annoyed that Princeton was not living up to its potential  complaining   There s a little college down in Kentucky which in 60 years has graduated more men who have acquired prominence and fame than has Princeton in her 150 years      Wilson  a disciple of Walter Bagehot   considered the United States Constitution to be cumbersome and open to corruption  Wilson favored a parliamentary system for the United States and in the early 1880s wrote   I ask you to put this question to yourselves  should we not draw the Executive and Legislature closer together  Should we not  on the one hand  give the individual leaders of opinion in Congress a better chance to have an intimate party in determining who should be president  and the president  on the other hand  a better chance to approve himself a statesman  and his advisers capable men of affairs  in the guidance of Congress      Wilson s first political work  Congressional Government  1885   advocated a parliamentary system  He critically described the United States government  with frequent negative comparisons to Westminster   Critics contended the book was written without the benefit of the author observing any operational aspect of the U S  Congress  and supporters asserted the work was the product of the imagination of a future statesman  The book reflected the greater power of the legislature  relative to the executive  during the post bellum period    Wilson later became a regular contributor to Political Science Quarterly   an academic journal     Wilson s second publication in 1890 was a textbook  entitled The State   used widely in college courses throughout the country until the 1920s  He argued that government should not be deemed evil and advocated the use of government to allay social ills and advance society s welfare    in 1889 Wilson contributed to a U S  historical series  covering the period from Pres  Jackson through Reconstruction  His third book  entitled Division and Reunion   was published in 1893 and considered an outstanding contribution to American historical writing    Wilson s fourth publication  a five volume work entitled History of the American People   was the culmination of a series of articles written for Harper s   and was published in 1902    In 1899  Wilson wrote in The State that governments could legitimately promote the general welfare by forbidding child labor  by supervising the sanitary conditions of factories  by limiting the employment of women in occupations hurtful to their health  by instituting official tests of the purity or the quality of goods sold  by limiting the hours of labor in certain trades   and  by a hundred and one limitations of the power of unscrupulous or heartless men to out do the scrupulous and merciful in trade or industry     Wilson believed that America s system of checks and balances complicated American governance  If government behaved badly  Wilson queried   How is the schoolmaster  the nation  to know which boy needs the whipping     Wilson singled out the United States House of Representatives for particular criticism  saying        divided up  as it were  into forty seven seignories  in each of which a Standing Committee is the court baron and its chairman lord proprietor  These petty barons  some of them not a little powerful  but none of them within reach  of  the full powers of rule  may at will exercise an almost despotic sway within their own shires  and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself      In his last scholarly work  Constitutional Government of the United States  1908   Wilson said that the presidency  will be as big as and as influential as the man who occupies it   By the time of his presidency  Wilson hoped that presidents could be party leaders in the same way British prime ministers were  Wilson also hoped that the parties could be reorganized along ideological  not geographic  lines  He wrote   Eight words contain the sum of the present degradation of our political parties  No leaders  no principles  no principles  no parties      Wilson also wrote that charity efforts should be removed from the private domain and  made the imperative legal duty of the whole  a position which  according to Robert M  Saunders  seemed to indicate that Wilson was laying the groundwork for the modern welfare state     Wilson also studied public administration  which he called     government in action  it is the executive  the operative  the most visible side of government  and is of course as old as government itself     He believed that the study of public administration could enable officials to increase governmental efficiency    He faulted political leaders who focused on philosophical issues and the nature of government and dismissed the critical issues of government administration as mere  practical detail   He thought such attitudes represented the requirements of smaller countries and populations  By his day  he thought      it is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one     He thought it time     to straighten the paths of government  to make its business less unbusinesslike  to strengthen and purify its organization  and it to crown its dutifulness     He summarized the growth of such foreign states as Prussia  France  and England  highlighting the events that led to advances in administration   By contrast  he thought the United States required greater compromise because of the diversity of public opinion and the difficulty of forming a majority opinion  thus practical reform to the government was necessarily slow  Yet Wilson insisted that     administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics    and that     general laws which direct these things to be done are as obviously outside of and above administration     He likened administration to a machine that functions independent of the changing mood of its leaders  Such a line of demarcation is intended to focus responsibility for actions taken on the people or persons in charge  As Wilson put it      public attention must be easily directed  in each case of good or bad administration  to just the man deserving of praise or blame  There is no danger in power  if only it be not irresponsible  If it be divided  dealt out in share to many  it is obscured       Essentially  the items under the discretion of administration must be limited in scope  as to not block  nullify  obfuscate  or modify the implementation of governmental decree made by the executive branch   Wilson had in the past been offered the presidency at the University of Illinois in 1892  and at the University of Virginia in 1901  both of which he declined    The Princeton trustees promoted Professor Wilson to president in June1902  replacing Francis Landey Patton   whom the trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator     Although the school s endowment was barely  4million  Wilson sought  2million for a preceptorial system of teaching   1million for a school of science  and nearly  3million for new buildings and salary increases  As a long term objective  Wilson sought  3million for a graduate school and  2 5million for schools of jurisprudence and electrical engineering   as well as a museum of natural history    He increased the faculty from 112 to 174  most of whom he selected himself on the basis of their records as outstanding teachers  The curriculum guidelines he developed proved important progressive innovations in the field of higher education    Wilson also made biblical studies a scholarly pursuit  appointed the first Jew and the first Roman Catholic to the faculty  and helped liberate the board from domination by conservative Presbyterians     To emphasize the development of expertise  Wilson instituted academic departments and a system of core requirements  Students were to meet for these in groups of six with preceptors  followed by two years of concentration in a selected major  He tried to raise admission standards and to replace the  gentleman s C  with serious study  Wilson aspired  as he told alumni   to transform thoughtless boys performing tasks into thinking men      In 1906 Wilson awoke to find himself blind in the left eye  the result of a blood clot and hypertension  Modern medical opinion surmises Wilson had suffered a stroke he later was diagnosed  as his father had been  with hardening of the arteries   he took a Bermuda vacation  He began to exhibit his father s traits of impatience and intolerance  which would on occasion lead to errors of judgment    In 1896 Wilson had  somewhat prophetically  described his problem  in the sesquicentennial speech at Princeton      your thorough Presbyterian is not subject to the ordinary laws of life  is of too stubborn a fiber  too unrelaxing a purpose  to suffer mere inconvenience to bring defeat      When Wilson began vacationing in Bermuda in 1906  he met a socialite  Mary Hulbert Peck  Their visits together became a regular occurrence on his return  Wilson in his letters home to Ellen openly related these gatherings as well his other social events  According to biographer August Heckscher   Ellen could sense a problem  and it became the topic of frank discussion between them  Wilson historians have not conclusively established there was an affair  but Wilson did on one occasion write a musing in shorthandon the reverse side of a draft for an editorial   my precious one  my beloved Mary      Wilson also sent very personal letters which would be used against him by his adversaries later     On another occasion while Wilson was vacationing solo in the British Isles  Ellen journeyed to Connecticut  She joined the household of respected artist Florence Griswold to further pursue her own interests     During his time at Princeton  he attempted to curtail the influence of social elites by abolishing the upper class eating clubs   He proposed moving the students into colleges  also known as quadrangles  Wilson s Quad Plan was met with fierce opposition from Princeton s alumni  Wilson persisted  saying that giving in  would be to temporize with evil     In October1907  due to the intensity of alumni opposition  the Board of Trustees withdrew its support for the Quad Plan and instructed Wilson to withdraw it    Not long afterward  Wilson suffered a recurrence of his 1906 ailment  as before  a vacation was prescribed and proved beneficial     Late in his tenure  Wilson had a confrontation with Andrew Fleming West   dean of the graduate school  and also West s ally ex President Grover Cleveland   who was a trustee  Wilson wanted to integrate a proposed graduate school building into the campus core  while West preferred a more distant campus site  In 1909 Wilson s final year at Princeton began with a gift made to the graduate school campaign subject to the graduate school being located off campus  the acceptance of this condition by the board was a pivotal defeat for Wilson    The national press covered the confrontation as a battle between the elites  represented by West  versus the populists  represented by Wilson   From its outset  Wilson became disenchanted with resistance to his recommendations at Princeton  he ruminated on future political leadership  Prior to the Democratic presidential nominating convention in 1908  Wilson had dropped hints to some influential players in the Democratic Party of his interest in the Democratic ticket  While he had no real expectations of being placed on the ticket  he did leave instructions that he should not be offered the vice presidential nomination  And then he was off for a vacation in Scotland  Party regulars considered his ideas politically as well as geographically detached and fanciful  But  the seeds had been sown    Wilson later commented that politics was less brusque than university administration     Wilson was elected president of the American Political Science Association in 1910  but soon decided to leave his Princeton post and enter New Jersey state politics     McGeorge Bundy in 1956 described Wilson s contribution to Princeton   Wilson was right in his conviction that Princeton must be more than a wonderfully pleasant and decent home for nice young men  it has been more ever since his time      In January1910 Wilson had drawn the attention of New Jersey s U S  Senator James Smith  Jr  and George Harvey as the potential Democratic standard bearer in the upcoming gubernatorial election  On July12  1910 he was introduced to New Jersey s power players at the Lawyers Club in New York  including James Richard Nugent   Robert S  Hudspeth   Millard F  Ross   and Richard V  Lindabury   The bosses had chosen their man  but his nomination was not a givenmany  including organized labor  felt Wilson was an inexperienced newcomer    Nevertheless  the bosses marshaled their forces at the party convention  and on September14 Wilson was nominated  this  despite his endorsement of the local option on the liquor issuein opposition to the political machine  He submitted his letter of resignation to Princeton on October20     Wilson s opponent in the general election was the Republican candidate Vivian M  Lewis   the State Commissioner of Banking and Insurance  Wilson s campaign focused on his promise to be independent of party bosses  Wilson quickly shed his professorial style for more emboldened speechmaking  and presented himself as a full fledged progressive    He soundly defeated Lewis by a margin of more than 650 000 votes  although Republican William Howard Taft had carried New Jersey in the 1908 presidential election by more than 82 000 votes      Historian Edmund Morris called Wilson in the Governor s race a  dark horse   He attributed his and others  success against the Taft Republicans in 1910 in part to the emergent national progressive message enunciated by Theodore Roosevelt in his post presidency     In the 1910 election  the Democrats also took control of the General Assembly   though the State Senate remained in Republican hands  Wilson appointed Joseph Patrick Tumulty as his private secretary  a position he held throughout Wilson s political career    He began formulating his reformist agenda  intending to ignore the demands of party machinery  After Wilson s election  political boss U S  Senator Smith asked Wilson to endorse his own reelection bid in the state legislature  this was before popular election of senators   Wilson refused  and endorsed Smith s opponent James E Martine   When Martine won the seat  Wilson had manifestly positioned himself as a new leader in the party in that state     Wilson concentrated on four major state reformschanges in the election laws  a corrupt practices act  Workmen s Compensation  and establishment of a commission to regulate utilities  The Geran bill  drafted by Del  Elmer H Geran  expanded public participation in primaries for all offices including party officials and delegates  it was thus directed at the power of the political bosses  It passed the state assembly  albeit by a narrow margin  The corrupt practices law and Workmen s Compensation statute soon followed     Wilson s prominence as governor and in the national media induced his presidential campaign in 1912  Wilson committed himself to try for the Democratic nomination in March of the prior year when he spoke at an Atlanta meeting of the Southern Commercial Congress  afterwards he said   I was given a dinner  breakfast and reception  and on every possible occasion was nominated for the presidency     While Wilson was in Atlanta  his wife Ellen  alert that key Democrat William Jennings Bryan was visiting Princeton  and recalling Wilson s opposition to him in 1896  invited him for dinner upon Wilson s return  Indeed  the establishment of rapport with Bryan  the most recent standard bearer of the party  was a success     Wilson began a truly public campaign for the nomination in the south  with a speech to the Pewter Platter Club in Norfolk  Va   While he was received enthusiastically  the speech  reformist in nature  was considered provocative and radical by the conservative audience  making the visit on the whole less than positive    With Wilson the first Southerner to have a serious chance at the White House since 1848 however  Southern Democrats in general strongly supported Wilson s campaign for the nomination in 1912    More of Wilson s support came from young progressives in that region  including intellectuals  editors and lawyers  Wilson managed to maneuver through the complexities of local politics  For example  in Tennessee the Democratic Party was divided over prohibition   Wilson was progressive and sober  but not dry  and appealed to both sides  They united behind him to win the presidential election in the state  but divided over state politics and lost the gubernatorial election     After Norfolk  Wilson then proceeded westward to Kansas  Colorado  California  Oregon and Washington  he favored voting reforms which empowered the populace  such as the initiative   the referendum and the recall  excepting judges     In California Wilson was asked about his views on women s suffrage and though he was firmly opposed  he evasively said that it was a matter for the states to decide     In July1911 Wilson brought William Gibbs McAdoo and Edward Mandell House in to manage the campaign    The 1912 Democratic convention in Baltimore was one of the most dramatic conventions in American history  only the Republican conventions of 1880 and 1940  and the Democratic convention of 1952 are comparable    William F  McCombs who helped Wilson win the governorship served as convention Chairman  The Republicans at their convention had set the stage a week earlier  nominating incumbent William Howard Taft  with Theodore Roosevelt stalking out  to launch an independent campaign to split the party vote    Wilson was convinced that the Baltimore convention should be allowed to work its will without his interferenceso he went golfing and motoring  As for his assistant Tumulty  he  nearly collapsed  under the strain    The convention deadlocked for over forty ballotsno candidate could reach the two thirds vote required  The leading contender was House Speaker Champ Clark   a prominent progressive  strongest in the border states  Other less charismatic contenders were Governor Judson Harmon of Ohio  and Representative Oscar Underwood of Alabama  Publisher William Randolph Hearst   a leader of the left wing of the party  supported Clark  William Jennings Bryan   the nominee in 1896  1900 and 1908  played a critical role in his declared opposition to any candidate supported by  the financiers of Wall Street   Indeed  on the tenth ballot New York s delegation went unanimously to Clark  and the battle lines were clearly drawn between the bosses and the rank and file delegates    Bryan then announced on the fourteenth ballot that his vote for Clark would be withheld due to the New York vote  Wilson s tally began to climb steadily  and he initially topped Clark s vote on the thirtieth ballot    Bryan announced for Wilson  who ultimately won the nomination on the 46th ballot    Wilson chose Indiana Governor Thomas R  Marshall as his running mate    Wilson directed Chairman of Finance  Henry Morgenthau not to accept contributions from corporations and to prioritize smaller donations from the widest possible quarters of the public  and Morgenthau succeeded admirably  In order to further embolden Democrats  especially in New Jersey and New York  Wilson set out to ensure the defeat of local candidates supported by machines  who were running for re electionJames Smith Jr   U S  Senate in New Jersey  and John Dix  Governor of New York   He succeeded in both of these efforts and thereby weakened arguments that party control resided with political bosses     Speeches in Buffalo and New York City exemplified the pattern of Wilson s speechmaking  His oratory style was   right out of my mind as it is working at the time   He maintained towards his primary opponent Roosevelt a tone of humorous detachment  describing the Bull Moose party as  the irregular Republicans  the variegated Republicans   Wilson shunned the stump speech campaign routine  and initially was reticent to conduct an extensive campaign tour  but this changed after Roosevelt went on the offensive     A notably progressive speech In Minneapolis included the following   that property as compared with humanity  as compared with the vital red blood in the American people  must take second place  not first place     Wilson frequently sought out Louis D  Brandeis for advice on economic policythat corporate trusts be regulated by the government  His campaign then increased its focus upon the elimination of monopoly in all forms  Wilson also concluded that major reforms in banking and a lower tariff were needed to eliminate the spheres of entrenched interests which distorted the functioning of the free market    In Indianapolis he said that for the next president  there will be no greater burden in our generation than to organize the forces of liberty And to make conquest of a new freedom for America   This serendipitous comment spawned the title of Wilson s policy of  New Freedom    emphasizing the lower tariffs and limited federal governmentalbeit with increased anti trust law enforcement and creation of a new banking regulator  the Federal Reserve System      When Roosevelt was wounded by an assassin  Wilson restricted his events to those already scheduled and limited his criticism to the regular Republicans  It was evident by this time that the Wilson movement would not be checked    The GOP split between Taft and Roosevelt enlarged Wilson s success in the electoral college  Wilson appealed to African Americans and promised to work for them  gaining some support among them in the North at the expense of the Republicans  Wilson took 41 8  of the popular vote and won 435 electoral votes from 40 states    It is not clear if Roosevelt extracted more support from fellow Republican Taft  or fellow progressive Wilson     After a vacation in Bermuda Wilson was energized and more aggressive  even combative  He noted the presidency was an office  in which a man must put on his war paint  In Chicago  he addressed the Commercial Club  including some of the most powerful industrial and financial leaders of the Midwest  he unapologetically emphasized his progressivism and called his audience to account for their malpractices in business affairs     In his inaugural address Wilson reiterated his agenda for lower tariffs and banking reform  as well as aggressive trust and labor legislation  the Wilsons decided against an inaugural ball and instead gathered with family and friends at the White House     Wilson s demand for private reflection was evident when he immediately announced that office seekers were not permitted to visit the White House  His decision making style was to use solitude in conjunction with prevailing opinions in making decisions    Wilson s personal staff reflected his preferences  Tumultys position provided a political buffer and intermediary with the press  and his irrepressible Irish sentiment offset the president s often dour Scotch disposition    Another close member of his personal staff was his physician  Navy medical officer Cary T  Grayson  who familiarized himself with the president s medical history and confirmed the circulatory problem and hardening of the arteries     Wilson pioneered twice weekly press conferences in the White House  Though they were modestly effective  the president prohibited his being quoted and was particularly indeterminate in his statements    The first such press conference was on March15  1913  when reporters were allowed to ask him questions    In 1913  he also became the first president to deliver the State of the Union address in person since 1801 when Thomas Jefferson discontinued this practice   Wilson  the only Democrat besides Grover Cleveland to be elected president since 1856  recognized his Party s need for high level federal patronage    Wilson was also the first Southerner elected to the White House since 1869 and worked closely with Southern Democrats  In Wilson s first month in office Postmaster General Albert S  Burleson and Treasury Secretary William G  McAdoo permitted lower level officials to racially segregate employees in those departments  Segregation in the federal government  which had begun earlier  now accelerated in accord with predominant public opinion    Heckscher argues that Wilson had indeed promised to deal generously with racial injustices  but did not deliver on these assurances  out of concern for his considerable legislative agenda     In an early and instructive foreign policy matter  Wilson responded to an angry protest by the Japanese when the state of California proposed legislation which excluded the Japanese from land ownership in the state  Wilson was reticent to assert federal supremacy over the state s legislation  There was talk of war and some argument within the cabinet for a show of naval force  which Wilson firmly rebuffed  after diplomatic exchanges the scare subsided  Japan wanted a treaty  beyond the RootTakahira Agreement then in place  but none was negotiated  Japanese anger and humiliation remained high for this and other reasons for decades to come       In implementing economic policy  Wilson had to transcend the sharply opposing policy views of the Southern and agrarian wing of the Democratic Party led by Bryan  and the pro business and Northern wing led by urban political bossesTammany in New York  Sullivan in Chicago and Smith and Nugent in Newark    In his Columbia lectures of 1907 Wilson had said  the whole art of statesmanship is the art of bringing the several parts of government into effective cooperation for the accomplishment of particular common objects     As he took up the first item of his  New Freedom  agendalowering the tariffshe quite adroitly applied this artistry  With large Democratic majorities in Congress and a healthy economy  he promptly seized the opportunity to effectuate his agenda    Wilson also made quick work of realizing his pledges to beef up antitrust regulation and to bring reform to banking and currency matters     While Wilson was busy with his prodigious legislative agenda  Ellen spent the summer and fall months of 1913 in Cornish  NH where she reprised her painting and was quite delighted doing so  She completed a number of New Hampshire landscapes which matched or exceeded the skills she had displayed up to that time  Though Wilson travelled to Cornish for brief visits  they both bemoaned their extended separation and frequently exchanged letters reflecting this and their affection for one another     To facilitate reduction of the tariffs  Wilson garnered unexpected support from a previous rival Oscar Underwood   Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  and Sen  Furnifold M  Simmons   Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee    In May1913  the Underwood Tariff passed in the House by a vote of 274 to 5  it would take a bit longer passing in the Senatein Septemberand was signed by Wilson three weeks later    Its effects were soon overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by World War I    Wilson mobilized public opinion behind the tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists in an address to Congress  and by staging an elaborate signing ceremony    The revenue lost by the lower tariff was replaced by a new federal income tax  authorized by the 16th Amendment    Wilson had not waited for completion of the tariff legislation to proceed with his next item of reformbankingwhich he initiated in June1913    After consulting with Brandeis  Wilson declared the banking system must be  public not private  must be vested in the government itself so that the banks must be the instruments  not the masters  of business     He tried to find a middle ground between conservative Republicans  led by Senator Nelson W  Aldrich   and the powerful left wing of the Democratic party  led by William Jennings Bryan   who strenuously denounced private banks and Wall Street   The latter group wanted a government owned central bank that could print paper money as Congress required  The compromise  based on the Aldrich Plan but sponsored by Democratic Congressmen Carter Glass and Robert Owen   allowed the private banks to control the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks   but appeased the agrarians by placing controlling interest in the System in a central board appointed by the president with Senate approval  Moreover  Wilson convinced Bryan s supporters that because Federal Reserve notes were obligations of the government  the plan met their demands for an elastic currency  Having 12 regional banks  with designated geographic districts  was meant to weaken the influence of the powerful New York banks  a key demand of Bryan s allies in the South and West  and was a key factor in winning Glass  support    The Federal Reserve Act passed in December1913     Wilson named Paul Warburg and other prominent bankers to direct the new system  While power was supposed to be decentralized  the New York branch dominated the Fed as the  first among equals     The new system began operations in 1915 and played a major role in financing the Allied and American war effort    The strengthening of the Federal Reserve was later a major accomplishment of the New Deal      At the end of 1913  summing up the president s efficacy  the Saturday Evening Post stated   This administration is Woodrow Wilson s and non other s  He is the top  middle and bottom of it  There is not an atom of divided responsibility the Democratic Party revolves about him  He is the center of itthe biggest Democrat in the countrythe leader and the chief      Wilson began pushing for legislation which culminated with the Federal Trade Commission Act signed in September1914  In doing so  Wilson broke with his predecessors  practice of litigating the antitrust issue in the courts  known as trust busting   the new Federal Trade Commission provided a new regulatory approach  to encourage competition and reduce perceived unfair trade practices    In addition  he pushed through Congress the Clayton Antitrust Act making certain business practices illegal  such as price discrimination   agreements prohibiting retailers from handling other companies  products  and directorates and agreements to control other companies  The power of this legislation was greater than that of previous anti trust laws since it dictated accountability of individual corporate officers and clarified guidelines  This law was considered the   Magna Carta   of labor by Samuel Gompers because it ended union liability antitrust laws  In 1916  under threat of a national railroad strike  Wilson approved legislation that increased wages and cut working hours of railroad employees  there was no strike     In the summer of 1914 Wilson gained repeal of toll exemptions at the Panama Canal for American ships  this was received positively by the international community  as a cessation of past discrimination against foreign commerce  The measure was considered unpatriotic by U S  business interests and opponents such as Tammany Hall     With the President reaching out to new constituencies  a series of programs were targeted at farmers  The SmithLever Act of 1914 created the modern system of agricultural extension agents sponsored by the state agricultural colleges  The agents taught new techniques to farmers  The 1916 Federal Farm Loan Act provided for issuance of low cost long term mortgages to farmers     Child labor was curtailed by the KeatingOwen Act of 1916  but the U S  Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1918  No major child labor prohibition would take effect until the 1930s     In October1913 when Mexico s president Victoriano Huerta summarily dissolved the Mexican Congress  Wilson withdrew diplomatic recognition  in an attempt to isolate him globally using a policy called  watchful waiting    This attempt appeared to be succeeding  with Britain and Germany for example  until Wilson removed an embargo on the shipment of arms to Huertas opposition  the Constitutionalists  led by Venustiano Carranza   this was considered too destabilizing  and strengthened support for the existing government    Wilson defended his action   we are the friends of constitutional government   because in no other way can our neighbors work out their own development in peace and liberty   Wilson appeared to contradict himself soon after  telling the British ambassador that political stability in Mexico could only be achieved when a fair distribution of land was carried out  Wilson s ambiguity led to his being misunderstood and even mocked in regard to the matter    After a U S  naval crew was briefly detained at Tampico disagreements intensified  Wilson received approval from the Congress to use military force if needed and later ordered an occupation of Vera Cruz  incorrectly assuming there would be little opposition  In fact  the action resulted in fatalities126 Mexicans and 19 Americansand Wilson s reputation as a statesman suffered severely for a time both at home and abroad     His miscalculation may well have resulted from his wife Ellen s failing health at the time  which weighed heavily upon him  Wilson gladly accepted the offer of the so called ABC powersArgentina  Brazil and Chileto mediate the Mexican dispute  With the negotiations prolonged in Niagara Falls  under mounting pressure Huerta fled to Spain and a month later Carranza victoriously entered Mexico City  Though the administration had achieved the desired result  it was a pyrrhic victory  as Carranza s lieutenant  Pancho Villa   presented a more serious threat in 1916     In a 1914 dispute between Colorado miners and their company   a confrontation resulted in the Ludlow Massacre the deaths of eight strikers  eleven children and two mothers  Part owner John D  Rockefeller  Jr  refused Wilson s offer of mediation  conditioned upon collective bargaining  so Wilson sent in U S  troops  While Wilson succeeded in bringing order to the situation  and demonstrated support for the labor union  the miners  unconditional surrender to the implacable owners was a defeat for Wilson     His wife Ellen s failing health  due to kidney failure   worsened in the spring of 1914  after a fall  she was bedridden  then rallied briefly  but Wilson wrote  my dear one grows weaker and weaker  with a pathetic patience and sweetness   He was at her bedside to the end  which came August6  when Wilson despairingly said  Oh my God  what am I to do   Wilson later wrote accurately of his mourning and depression   Of course you know what has happened to meGod has stricken me almost beyond what I can bear   Six months of depression followed for him  though mourning continued  At the same time that Wilson s private world shattered  World War I broke out in Europe  and this momentously changed his political life     In January1915  Wilson emerged from his depression during a spirited speech in Indianapolis where he said   the trouble with the Republican Party is that it has not had a new idea for thirty years the Republican Party is still a covert and a refuge for those who are afraid  for those who want to consult their grandfathers about everything     Another sign of Wilsons emotional restoration was the aggressiveness with which he pursued passage of a ship purchase bill to bulk up the inadequately equipped merchant marine  This lasted until March1915  when he moderated  drew back from the bill and  without its passage  congratulated the Congress for its work in the session just endedhis initial journey through mourning was evident     In February1915 Wilson had met Edith Bolling Galt   an attractive southern widow and jeweler  After several meetings  he fell in love  and in May  Wilson proposed  He was rebuffed initially but Wilson was undeterred and the courtship continued    Edith initially did not pursue the furtherance of their physical interaction with the vigor of Wilson  but she gradually warmed to the relationship and they became secretly engaged in the fall of 1915    Many in Wilson s camp had become concerned about the appearance of a premature romance soon after the death of his wife  the engagement was made public in October and they were married on December18     From 1914 until early 1917 Wilson s primary objective was to keep America out of the war in Europe   and his policy was   the true spirit of neutrality  which is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concerned     Wilson addressed the Congress in 1914   Such divisions amongst us would be fatal to our peace of mind and might seriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the one great nation at peace  the one people holding itself ready to play a part of impartial mediation and speak the counsels of peace and accommodation  not as a partisan  but as a friend     He made numerous offers to mediate and sent Colonel House on diplomatic missions  however  the Allies and the Central Powers dismissed the overtures  Wilson even thought it counterproductive to comment on atrocities by either side  this led to assertions of heartlessness on his part    Republicans  led by Theodore Roosevelt   criticized Wilson s refusal to build up the U S  Army in anticipation of war  but Wilson retained the support of the peace element  including women and the religious   Britain declared a blockade of neutral ships carrying contraband goods to Germany  Wilson mildly protested non lethal British violations of neutral rights  the British knew it wasn t a casus belli for the U S    In early 1915 Germany declared the waters around Great Britain to be a war zone  Wilson dispatched a note of protest  imposing  strict accountability  on Germany for the safety of neutral ships  The meaning of the policy  dubiously applied to specific incidents  evolved with the policy of neutrality  but ultimately formed the substance of U S  responses over the next two years    The commercial British steamship Falaba was sunk in March1915 by a German submarine with the loss of 111 lives  including one American in the Thrasher Incident   Wilson chose to avoid risking escalation of the war as a result of the loss of one American    In the spring of 1915 a German bomb struck an American ship  the Cushing and a German submarine torpedoed an American tanker  the Gulflight   Wilson took the view  based on some reasonable evidence  that both incidents were accidental  and that a settlement of claims could be postponed to the end of the war     A German submarine torpedoed and sank the British ocean liner RMS Lusitania in May1915  over a thousand perished  including many Americans  In a Philadelphia speech that weekend Wilson said   There is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight  There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right   Many reacted to these remarks with contempt    Wilson sent a subdued note to the Germans protesting its submarine warfare against commerce  the initial reply was evasive and received in the United States with indignation  Secretary of State Bryan  a dedicated pacifist  sensing the countrys path to war  resigned  and was replaced by Robert Lansing   The White Star liner the Arabic was then torpedoed  with two American casualties  The U S  threatened a diplomatic break unless Germany repudiated the action  the German ambassador then conveyed a note   liners will not be sunk by our submarines  Wilson had not stopped the submarine campaign  but won agreement that unarmed merchant ships would not be sunk without warning  and most importantly he had kept the U S  out of the war    Meanwhile  Wilson requested and received funds in the final 1916 appropriations bill to provide for 500 000 troops  It also included a five year Navy plan for major construction of battleships  cruisers  destroyers and submarinesshowing Wilson s dedication to a big Navy     In March1916 the Sussex   an unarmed ferry under the French flag  was torpedoed in the English Channel and four Americans were counted among the dead  the Germans had flouted the post  Lusitania exchanges  The president demanded the Germans reject their submarine tactics    Wilson drew praise when he succeeded in wringing from Germany a pledge to constrain their U boat warfare to the rules of cruiser warfare  This was a clear departure from existing practicesa diplomatic concession from which Germany could only more brazenly withdraw  and regrettably did     Coincidentally  early 1916 brought two separate Mexican incidents in which thirty six Americans were killed by the forces of Pancho Villa  Wilson ordered Gen  John Pershing and 4000 troops across the border to reinforce Carranza    In early April  though Villa had not been captured  Pershing s forces had broken up and dispersed his bands  yet  the forces continued their pursuit  Carranza then pivoted against the Americans and accused them of a punitive invasion  a confrontation in Parral resulted in two dead Americans and two wounded  plus hundreds of Mexican casualties  Pershing  recommending the railroads be seized and the country occupied  was ordered by Wilson to withdraw     Wilson made a plea for postwar union in May1916  his speech recited the right of every nation to its sovereignty  territorial integrity and freedom from aggression   So sincerely do we believe these things  Wilson said   that I am sure that I speak the mind and wish of the people of America when I say that the United States is willing to become a partner in any feasible association of nations formed in order to realize these objectives  At home the speech was seen as a turning point in policy  In Europe the words were received by the British and the French without comment  His harshest European critics rightly thought the speech reflected indifference on Wilsons part  indeed  Wilson never wavered from a belief that the war was the result of corrupt European power politics     Wilson made his final offer to mediate peace on December18  1916  As a preliminary  he asked both sides to state their minimum terms necessary for future security  The Central Powers replied that victory was certain  and the Allies required the dismemberment of their enemies  empires  no desire for peace existed  and the offer lapsed     Wilson s remarriage rejuvenated his personal aspirations for re election  Edith Wilson enjoyed  as Ellen never had  the crowds and the power as a close collaborator with her husband    Executive decisions just prior to the campaign also enabled Wilson to bolster his political mastery  He was presented with a vacancy on the Supreme Court  which he succeeded in filling with a controversial nominee  Louis Brandeis  the first Jewish member of the court    Also  in the summer of 1916 the nations economy was endangered by a railroad strike  The president called the parties to a White House summit in Augustafter two days and no results  Wilson proceeded to settle the issue  using the maximum eight hour work day as the linchpin  Once the Congress passed the Adamson bill incorporating the presidents proposal  the strike was cancelled  Wilson was praised for averting a national economic disaster  though the law was received with howls from conservatives denouncing a sellout to the unions and a surrender by Congress to an imperious president     In the campaign  McCombs was replaced as chairman of the Democratic Party by Vance C  McCormick   a leading progressive  and Ambassador Henry Morgenthau was recalled from Turkey to manage campaign finances     Colonel  House played an important role in the campaign   He planned its structure  set its tone  helped guide its finance  chose speakers  tactics  and strategy  and  not least  handled the campaign s greatest asset and greatest potential liability  its brilliant but temperamental candidate      Wilson  renominated without opposition  employed his campaign slogan  He kept us out of war   though he never promised unequivocally to stay out of the war  In his acceptance speech on September2  1916  Wilson pointedly warned Germany that submarine warfare resulting in American deaths would not be tolerated  saying  The nation that violates these essential rights must expect to be checked and called to account by direct challenge and resistance  It at once makes the quarrel in part our own      As the Party platform was drafted  Senator Owen of Oklahoma urged Wilson to take ideas from the Progressive Party platform of 1912 as a means of attaching to our party progressive Republicans who are in sympathy with us in so large a degree  At Wilson s request  Owen highlighted federal legislation to promote workers health and safety  prohibit child labour  provide unemployment compensation and establish minimum wages and maximum hours  Wilson  in turn  included in his draft platform a plank that called for all work performed by and for the federal government to provide a minimum wage  an eight hour day and six day workweek  health and safety measures  the prohibition of child labour  and  his own additions  safeguards for female workers and a retirement program     Wilson s opponent was Republican Charles Evans Hughes   former governor of New York with a progressive record similar to Wilson s as governor of New Jersey  Theodore Roosevelt commented that the only thing different between Hughes and Wilson was a shave  However  Hughes had to try to hold together a coalition of conservative Taft supporters and progressive Roosevelt partisans  and his campaign never assumed a definite form  Wilson ran on his record and ignored Hughes  reserving his attacks for Roosevelt  When asked why he did not attack Hughes directly  Wilson told a friend   Never murder a man who is committing suicide      The election outcome was in doubt for several days and was determined by several close states  Wilson won California by 3 773 of almost a million votes cast  and New Hampshire by 54 votes  Hughes won Minnesota by 393 votes out of over 358 000  In the final count  Wilson had 277 electoral votes vs  Hughes s 254  Wilson was able to win by picking up many votes that had gone to Teddy Roosevelt or Eugene V  Debs in 1912    By the time Hughes  concession telegram arrived  Wilson commented  it was a little moth eaten when it got here      In December 1916  a month after his reelection  Wilson  a noted supporter of mother s pensions     addressed a conference on social insurance in which he spoke of how a conference like that gave evidence of the dominant interest of our own time  and one of the best elements of social insurance is social understanding  an interchange of views and a comprehension of interests which for a long time was only too rare     Wilson was aggravated with the British for ignoring his suggestion of a postwar league of nations  he also objected to their seizure of mail from neutral ships and their blacklisting of firms trading with Britain s enemies  Wilson insisted a league of nations was the solution to ending the war     Wilson found it increasingly difficult to maintain neutrality  after Germany rescinded earlier promises  the Arabic pledge and the Sussex pledge   Early in 1917 the German ambassador Johann von Bernstorf informed Secretary of State Lansing of Germany s commitment to unrestricted submarine warfare  Bernstorff had tears in his eyes as he knew the U S  reaction would adversely affect his country s lot    Then came the revelation of the Zimmermann Telegram   in which Germany attempted to enlist Mexico as an ally  promising Mexico that if Germany was victorious  she would support Mexico in winning back the states of Texas  New Mexico and Arizona from the U S    Wilson s reaction after consulting the cabinet and the Congress was a minimal one  that diplomatic relations with the Germans be brought to a halt  The president said   We are the sincere friends of the German people and earnestly desire to remain at peace with them  We shall not believe they are hostile to us unless or until we are obliged to believe it     In March1917 several American ships were sunk by Germany and Teddy Roosevelt reacted   if he does not go to war I shall skin him alive    Wilson called a cabinet meeting on March20  in which the vote was unanimous for war     Wilson delivered his War Message to a special session of Congress on April2  1917  declaring that Germany s latest pronouncement had rendered his  armed neutrality  policy untenable and asking Congress to declare Germany s war stance was an act of war    He proposed the United States enter the war to  vindicate principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power   The German government  Wilson said   means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors   He then also warned that  if there should be disloyalty  it will be dealt with a firm hand of repression     Wilson closed with the following   We have no quarrel with the German people  We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship  We are glad to fight for the ultimate peace of the world the German people included  for the rights of nations great and small and for the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and obedience  The world must be made safe for democracy      The declaration of war by the United States against Germany passed Congress by strong bipartisan majorities on April4  1917  with opposition from ethnic German strongholds and remote rural areas in the South  It was signed by Wilson on April6  1917  The U S  did not sign a formal alliance with Britain or France but operated as an  associated  poweran informal ally with military cooperation through the Supreme War Council in London    The U S  raised a massive army through conscription and Wilson gave command to General John J  Pershing   with complete authority as to tactics  strategy and some diplomacy    Edward M  House   Wilson s key unofficial foreign affairs advisor  became the president s main channel of communication with the British government  and William Wiseman   a British naval attach  was Houses principal contact in England  Their personal relationship succeeded in serving the powers well  by overcoming strained relations in order to achieve essential understandings between the two governments  House also became the U S  representative on the Allies  Supreme War Council     March1917 also brought the first of two revolutions in Russia  which impacted the strategic role of the U S  in the war  The overthrow of the imperial government removed a serious barrier to America s entry into the European conflict  while the second revolution in November relieved the Germans of a major threat on their eastern front  and allowed them to dedicate more troops to the Western front  thus making U S  forces central to Allied success in battles of 1918  Wilson initially rebuffed pleas from the Allies to dedicate military resources to an intervention in Russia against the Bolsheviks   based partially on his experience from attempted intervention in Mexico  nevertheless he ultimately was convinced of the potential benefit and agreed to dispatch a limited force to assist the Allies on the eastern front     The Germans launched an offensive at Arras which prompted an accelerated deployment of troops by Wilson to the Western frontby August1918 a million American troops had reached France    The Allies initiated a counter offensive at Somme and by August the Germans had lost the military initiative and an Allied victory was in sight  In October came a message from the new German Chancellor Prince Max of Baden to Wilson requesting a general armistice    In the exchange of notes with Germany they agreed the Fourteen Points in principle be incorporated in the armistice  House then procured agreement from France and Britain  but only after threatening to conclude a unilateral armistice without them    Wilson ignored Gen  Pershing s plea to drop the armistice and instead demand an unconditional surrender by Germany     The War Industries Board   headed by Bernard Baruch   was established to set U S  war manufacturing policies and goals  future President Herbert Hoover lead the Food Administration   to conserve food  the Federal Fuel Administration   run by Henry Garfield  introduced daylight saving time and rationed fuel supplies  William McAdoo was in charge of war bond efforts and Vance McCormick headed the War Trade Board  All of the above  known collectively as the  war cabinet   met weekly with Wilson at the White House    These and other bodies were headed by businessmen recruited by Wilson for a dollar a day salary to make the government more efficient in the war effort     More favorable treatment was extended to those unions that supported the U S  war effort  such as the American Federation of Labor  AFL   Wilson worked closely with Samuel Gompers and the AFL  the railroad brotherhoods  and other  moderate  unions  which saw enormous growth in membership and wages during Wilson s administration    In the absence of rationing consumer prices soared  income taxes also increased and workers suffered  Despite this  appeals to buy war bonds were highly successful  The purchase of wartime bonds had the result of shifting the cost of the war to the taxpayers of the affluent 1920s     Antiwar groups  anarchists  communists   Industrial Workers of the World members  and other antiwar groups attempting to sabotage the war effort were targeted by the Department of Justice   many of their leaders were arrested for incitement to violence  espionage  or sedition       Wilson also established the first western propaganda office  the United States Committee on Public Information   headed by George Creel   the  Creel Commission   which circulated patriotic anti German appeals and conducted censorship of materials considered seditious    To further counter disloyalty to the war effort at home  Wilson pushed through Congress the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 to suppress anti British  pro German  or anti war statements    While he welcomed socialists who supported the war  he pushed at the same time to arrest and deport foreign born enemies    Many recent immigrants  resident aliens without U S  citizenship  who opposed America s participation in the war were deported to Soviet Russia or other nations under the powers granted in the Immigration Act of 1918          In an effort at reform and to shake up his Mobilization program  Wilson removed the chief of the Army Signal Corps and the chairman of the Aircraft Production Board on April18  1918    On May16  the President launched an investigation  headed by Republican Charles Evans Hughes   into the War Department and the Council of Defense    The Hughes report released on October31 found no major corruption violations or theft in Wilson s Mobilization program  although the report found incompetence in the aircraft program     With congressional elections approaching  in 1918 Wilson made an appeal to the public for the retention of a Democratic majority and this seriously backfired due to its self serving toneRepublicans successfully picked up majorities in both houses of Congress     Wilson initiated a secret series of studies named The Inquiry   primarily focused on Europe  and carried out by a group in New York which included geographers  historians and political scientists  the group was directed by Col  House    The studies culminated in a speech by Wilson to Congress on January8  1918  wherein he articulated America s long term war objectives  It was the clearest expression of intention made by any of the belligerent nations  The speech  known as the Fourteen Points  was authored mainly by Walter Lippmann and projected Wilson s progressive domestic policies into the international arena  The first six dealt with diplomacy  freedom of the seas and settlement of colonial claims  Then territorial issues were addressed and the final point  the establishment of an association of nations to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all nationsa League of Nations  The address was translated into many languages for global dissemination     When the time came  Wilson spent six months in Paris for the Peace Conferencethereby the first U S  president to travel to Europe while in office  and the first to visit the Pope    Wilson disembarked from the George Washington in Brest on December13  he took a break from the negotiations and departed February14  1919 for home  then returned to Paris three weeks later and remained until the conclusion of a treaty in June     Heckscher describes Wilson  during the first four weeks of the Conference as  playing  with force and discretion  a commanding rolehe established his priorities  secured accommodation on major issues and won preliminary acceptance of the League    He promoted his plan in France  and then at home in February  Wilson gave a speech at the Metropolitan Opera House in defense of the Leaguehe was more insistent about it than ever  Heckscher contends that the enduring image of Wilson as a grim  unsmiling and unforgiving figure dates from this visit home during the conference    While the general public along with editorial writers  churches and peace groups generally favored the League  the Republicans vowed to defeat the League and discredit Wilson    Wilson notably did not address the Congress as to ongoing deliberations at the peace conference  as indeed his counterpart Lloyd George did with Parliament  Heckscher opines that this was a missed opportunity to forge the debate even though the Congressional majority had changed  In France he was without the usual control over his message through the media  in fact  the French initiated an aggressive propaganda campaign in the midst of the Conference to effect its outcome     At the conclusion of the visit home Wilson suffered an illness en route to France  the ensuing months brought a decline in health and in power and prestige  On arrival  it was immediately clear the conference had struggled in his absenceCol  House had compromised Wilson s prior gains  and Wilson set out to attempt to regain the lost ground    During these  dark days  of the conference Taft cabled to Wilson three proposed amendments to the League covenant which he thought would considerably increase its acceptability to the Europeansthe right of withdrawal from the League  the exemption of domestic issues from the League and the inviolability of the Monroe Doctrine  Wilson very reluctantly accepted these amendments  explaining why he later was more inflexible in the Senate treaty negotiations    On April3 Wilson fell violently ill during a conference meeting  in a narrow escape from influenza  Though his symptoms receded within a couple of days  those around him noticed a distinct  lasting deterioration     The charter of the proposed League of Nations was incorporated into the conference s Treaty of Versailles     Japan proposed that the Covenant include a racial equality clause   Wilson was indifferent to the issue  but acceded to strong opposition from Australia and Britain    After the conference  Wilson said that  at last the world knows America as the savior of the world      For his peace making efforts  Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize     John Maynard Keynes  an anti Wilson and anti League intellectual  asserted Wilson was not well regarded at the Conference      he was in many respects   ill informed as to European conditions   his mind was slow and unadaptable   There can seldom have been a statesman of the first rank more incompetent than the President in the agilities of the council chamber     Keynes  highly regarded rhetoric became the prevailing judgment of the conference for decades     The chances were less than favorable for ratification of the treaty by a two thirds vote of the Republican Senate  Public opinion was mixed  with intense opposition from most Republicans  Germans  and Irish Catholic Democrats  In numerous meetings with Senators  Wilson discovered opposition had hardened  Despite his weakened physical condition Wilson decided to barnstorm the Western states  scheduling 29 major speeches and many short ones to rally support     Wilson had earlier downplayed Germany s as guilt in starting the war by calling for  peace without victory   but he had taken an increasingly hard stand at Paris and rejected advice to soften the treaty s treatment of Germany    In a reversal of his earlier position  in summer 1919 Wilson repeatedly stressed Germany s guilt  saying the treaty   seeks to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history  the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization  and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment  She attempted an intolerable thing and she must be made to pay for the attempt      Wilson had a series of debilitating strokes and had to cut short his trip on September26  1919  He became an invalid in the White House  closely monitored by his wife  who insulated him from negative news and downplayed for him the gravity of his condition    Senator Lodge led the opposition to the treaty in the Republican controlled Senate  the key point of disagreement was whether the League would diminish the power of Congress to declare war   It proved possible to build a majority for the treaty in the Senate  but the two thirds coalition needed to ratify was insurmountable    One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty  a second group supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations  The largest blocLodge and the Republicanswanted a treaty with reservations  especially on Article X  which empowered the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress  Finally  a bipartisan group of 13   irreconcilables   opposed a treaty in any form    In mid November1919 Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro Treaty Democrats  and were close to a two thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations  but the seriously indisposed Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to defeat ratification  Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson s stroke in September had debilitated him from negotiating effectively with Lodge     Wilson s administration did effectively demobilize the country at the war s end  A plan to form a commission for the purpose was abandoned in the face of Republican control the Senate  which complicated the appointment of commission members  Instead  Wilson favored the prompt dismantling of wartime boards and regulatory agencies    Demobilization was chaotic and violent  four million soldiers were sent home with little planning  little money  few benefits  and other vague promises  A wartime bubble in prices of farmland burst  leaving many farmers deeply in debt after they purchased new land  Major strikes in the steel  coal  and meatpacking industries disrupted the economy in 1919    Racial animosity erupted in serious race riots of ethnic whites against blacks in Chicago   Omaha   and two dozen other major cities in the North     As the election of 1920 approached  Wilson momentarily imagined that a deadlocked Democratic convention might nominate him for a third term with a campaign focused on the League of Nations  No one around the President adequately clarified for him that he was too incapacitated  had insufficient support  and that the League defeat was irreversible    In retirement  Wilson harbored hopes for a White House run in 1924 despite the absence of substantial support     Wilson frequently intervened in Latin American affairs  saying in 1913   I am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men     These interventions included Mexico in 1914  Haiti   Dominican Republic in 1916  Cuba in 1917  and Panama in 1918  The U S  maintained troops in Nicaragua throughout the Wilson administration and used them to select the president of Nicaragua and then to force Nicaragua to pass the Bryan Chamorro Treaty   American troops in Haiti  under the command of the federal government  forced the Haitian legislature to choose as Haitian president the candidate Wilson selected    Wilson ordered the military occupation of the Dominican Republic shortly after the resignation of its President Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra in 1916  The U S  military worked in concert with wealthy Dominican landowners to suppress the gavilleros   a campesino guerrilla force fighting the occupation  The occupation lasted until 1924  and was notorious for its brutality against those in the resistance    Wilson also negotiated a treaty with Colombia in which the U S  apologized for its role in the Panama Revolution of 19031904     After Russia left World War I following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917  the Allies sent troops there to prevent a German or Bolshevik takeover of allied provided weapons  munitions and other supplies previously shipped as aid to the pre revolutionary government    Wilson sent armed forces to assist the withdrawal of Czechoslovak Legions along the Trans Siberian Railway   and to hold key port cities at Arkangel and Vladivostok   Though specifically instructed not to engage the Bolsheviks  the U S  forces engaged in several armed conflicts against forces of the new Russian government  Revolutionaries in Russia resented the American intrusion  As Robert Maddox puts it   The immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war  thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society     Wilson withdrew most of the soldiers on April1  1920  though some remained until as late as 1922   In 1919  Wilson guided American foreign policy to  acquiesce  in the Balfour Declaration without supporting Zionism in an official way  Wilson expressed sympathy for the plight of Jews  especially in Poland and in France     In May1920  Wilson sent a long deferred proposal to Congress to have the U S  accept a mandate from the League of Nations to take over Armenia     Bailey notes this was opposed by American public opinion    while Richard G  Hovannisian states that Wilson  made all the wrong arguments  for the mandate and focused less on the immediate policy than on how history would judge his actions    he  wished to place it clearly on the record that the abandonment of Armenia was not his doing     The resolution won the votes of only 23 senators   The immediate cause of Wilson s incapacity in September1919 was the physical strain of the public speaking tour he undertook in support of ratification of the Treaty of Versailles  In Pueblo  Colorado   on September25  1919  he collapsed and never fully recovered     On October2  1919  he suffered a serious stroke  leaving him paralyzed on his left side  and with only partial vision in the right eye    He was confined to bed for weeks and sequestered from everyone except his wife and physician  Dr  Cary Grayson     For some months he used a wheelchair and later he required use of a cane  His wife and aide Joe Tumulty were said to have helped a journalist  Louis Seibold  present a false account of an interview with the President     He was insulated by his wife  who selected matters for his attention and delegated others to his cabinet  Wilson temporarily resumed a perfunctory attendance at cabinet meetings    By February1920  the President s true condition was public  Many expressed qualms about Wilson s fitness for the presidency at a time when the League fight was reaching a climax  and domestic issues such as strikes  unemployment  inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze  No one  including his wife  his physician  or personal assistant  was willing to take upon themselves responsibility for the certification  required by the Constitution  of his  inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office     This complex case became a motivation for passage of the 25th Amendment      Wilson favored woman suffrage at the state level  but held off support for a nationwide constitutional amendment because his party was sharply divided  with the South opposing an amendment on the grounds of state s rights  In any case  the only Southern state to give its women the vote was Arkansas   The National Woman s Party  NWP  in 1917 1919 launched a highly visible campaign attacking Wilson and his party for not enacting an amendment  Wilson  however  kept in close touch with the much larger and more moderate suffragists of the National American Woman Suffrage Association   He continued to hold off until he was sure the Democratic Party in the North was supportive  the 1917 referendum in New York State in favor of suffrage proved decisive for him  In January1918  Wilson went in person to the House and made a strong and widely published appeal to the House to pass the bill  It passed but the Senate stalled until 1919  then finally sent the amendment to the states for ratification    Behn argues that   Several historians have criticized a number of Wilson s policies on racial grounds              According to critics  Wilson believed that slavery was wrong on economic labor grounds  rather than for moral reasons    They also argue that he idealized the slavery system in the South  viewing masters as patient with  indolent  slaves    In terms of Reconstruction   they argue that Wilson held the common southern view that the South was demoralized by Northern carpetbaggers and that overreach on the part of the Radical Republicans justified extreme measures to reassert Democratic national and state governments       Wilson s War Department drafted hundreds of thousands of blacks into the army  giving them equal pay with whites  but in accord with military policy from the Civil War through the Second World War  kept them in all black units with white officers  and kept the great majority out of combat    When a delegation of blacks protested the discriminatory actions  Wilson told them  segregation is not a humiliation but a benefit  and ought to be so regarded by you gentlemen   In 1918  W  E  B  Du Bois a leader of the NAACP who had campaigned for Wilsonwas offered an Army commission in charge of dealing with race relations  DuBois accepted  but he failed his Army physical and did not serve     While president of Princeton University   Wilson had discouraged blacks from applying for admission  preferring to keep the peace among white students and alumni    Wilson s History of the American People  1901  explained the Ku Klux Klan of the late 1860s as a lawless reaction to a lawless period  Wilson wrote that the Klan  began to attempt by intimidation what they were not allowed to attempt by the ballot or by any ordered course of public action      Cabinet heads appointed by President Wilson re segregated restrooms and cafeterias in their buildings  Wilson showed the film Birth of a Nation in the White House  The film praised the Ku Klux Klan and portrayed blacks as uncouth and uncivilized  Wilson  who did not know the nature of the film beforehand  never praised the film and considered it to be  a very unfortunate production     During Wilson s term  the government began requiring photographs of all applicants for federal jobs  He told black leaders that he sincerely believed this was in their interest     Wilson s chief of staff   Secretary   was Joseph Patrick Tumulty from 1913 to 1921  but he was largely upstaged after 1916 when Wilson s second wife  Edith Bolling Galt Wilson  assumed full control of Wilson s schedule  The most important foreign policy advisor and confidant was  Colonel  Edward M  House until Wilson broke with him in early 1919  for his missteps at the peace conference in Wilson s absence     Wilson appointed three Associate Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States    Along with his Supreme Court appointments  Wilson appointed 20 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals and 52 judges to the United States district courts    After the end of his second term in 1921  Wilson and his wife moved from the White House to an elegant 1915 town house in the Embassy Row   Kalorama   section of Washington  D C    Wilson continued daily drives  and attended Keith s vaudeville theatre on Saturday nights  Wilson was one of only two U S  Presidents   Theodore Roosevelt was the first  to have served as president of the American Historical Association      On November10  1923  Wilson made a short Armistice Day radio speech from the library of his home  his last national address  The following day he spoke briefly from the front steps to more than 20 000 well wishers gathered outside the house         On February3  1924  Wilson died at home of a stroke and other heart related problems at age 67  He was interred in a sarcophagus in Washington National Cathedral   the only president interred in Washington  D C    Mrs  Wilson stayed in the home another 37 years  dying there on December28  1961  Wilson s birthday and the day she was to be the guest of honor at the opening of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge across the Potomac River near Washington  Mrs  Wilson left the home and much of the contents to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to be made into a museum honoring her husband  The Woodrow Wilson House opened to the public in 1963  was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964  and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966     Wilson left his daughter Margaret an annuity of  2 500 annually for as long as she remained unmarried  and left to his daughters what had been his first wife s personal property  The rest he left to Edith as a life estate with the provision that at her death  his daughters would divide the estate among themselves     Wilson s presidential papers and his personal library are at the Library of Congress      In recognition of his signing on March2  1917 the  Jones Act  that granted United States citizenship to Puerto Ricans  streets in several municipalities there were renamed  Calle Wilson   including one in the Mariani neighborhood in Ponce and the Condado section of San Juan    The largest denomination of U S  currency ever printed  the  100 000 bill bears Wilson s portrait  meant for use only among Federal Reserve Banks     The USS Woodrow Wilson  SSBN 624    a Lafayette class ballistic missile submarine  was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Wilson  She later was converted into an attack submarine and redesignated SSN 624   The Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs was founded at Princeton in 1930  It was created in the spirit of Wilson s interest in preparing students for leadership in public and international affairs   Shadow Lawn   the Summer White House for Wilson during his term in office  became part of Monmouth University in 1956  The college has placed a marker on the building  renamed Woodrow Wilson Hall  commemorating the home  It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1985   In 1944  Darryl F  Zanuck of 20th Century Fox produced a film titled Wilson   It looked back with nostalgia to Wilson s presidency  especially concerning his role as commander in chief during World War I   A section of the Rambla of Montevideo  Uruguay   is named Rambla Presidente Wilson   A street in the 16th

velt     a   October 27  1858  January 6  1919   often referred to as Teddy or TR   was an American statesman  author  explorer  soldier  naturalist  and reformer who served as the 26th President of the United States   from 1901 to 1909  A leader of the Republican Party   he was a leading force of the Progressive Era   Born a sickly child with debilitating asthma  Roosevelt embraced a strenuous lifestyle and successfully regained his health  He integrated his exuberant personality  vast range of interests  and world famous achievements into a  cowboy  persona defined by robust masculinity   Home schooled  he became a lifelong naturalist before attending Harvard College   His first of many books  The Naval War of 1812  1882   established his reputation as both a learned historian and a popular writer  He entered politics  becoming the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York s state legislature  Following the deaths of his wife and mother  he escaped to the wilderness and operated a cattle ranch in the Dakotas  He returned to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886  He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under William McKinley  resigning after one year to serve with the Rough Riders   gaining national fame for courage during the War in Cuba   Returning a war hero  he was elected governor of New York in 1898  A frustrated party establishment made him McKinley s running mate in the election of 1900   He campaigned vigorously across the country  helping McKinley win reelection by a landslide on a platform of peace  prosperity  and conservatism   The assassination of President McKinley in September 1901 meant that at age 42  Roosevelt had become President of the United States  the youngest in history  Leading his party and country into the Progressive Era   he championed his   Square Deal   domestic policies  promising the average citizen fairness  breaking of trusts  regulation of railroads  and pure food and drugs  Making conservation a top priority  he established myriad new national parks  forests  and monuments in order to preserve the nation s natural resources  In foreign policy  he concentrated on Central America   where he began construction of the Panama Canal   He also greatly expanded the United States Navy and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States  naval power  His successful efforts to end the Russo Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize   Elected in 1904 to a full term  he continued pursuit of progressive policies  eventually culminating in blockage of his legislative agenda in Congress  Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend  William Howard Taft   for the presidency  After leaving office  he went on safari in Africa and toured Europe  Returning to the USA  he became frustrated with Taft s approach as his successor  trying  but failing to win the nomination in 1912   He founded his own party  the Progressive  Bull Moose  Party   and called for wide ranging progressive reforms  The split allowed the Democrats to win the White House and Congress in 1912   those Republicans aligned with Taft would control the Republican Party for decades   Frustrated at home  Roosevelt led a two year expedition in the Amazon   nearly dying of tropical disease  During World War I   he opposed President Wilson for keeping the U S  out of the war against Germany  and offered his military services  which were never summoned  Although he planned to run again for president in 1920  his health quickly deteriorated  and he died in early 1919  Roosevelt has consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the greatest U S  Presidents     His face adorns Mount Rushmore alongside those of Washington  Jefferson  and Lincoln     Theodore Roosevelt was born on October 27  1858  in a four story brownstone at 28 East 20th Street   in Manhattan   New York   He was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart  Mittie  Bulloch and glass businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt  Sr  He had an older sister  Anna  nicknamed  Bamie    a younger brother  Elliott   and a younger sister  Corinne   Elliott was the father of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt   the wife of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt   His paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent    his other ancestry included English  Scots Irish    Scottish  Welsh  French  and German    Thee  Theodore Roosevelt  Sr   was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack  C V S   Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill  Thee s fourth cousin  James Roosevelt I   who was also a businessman  was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  Mittie was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P   Patsy  Stewart    Through the Van Schaacks Roosevelt is a descendant of the Schuyler family      Roosevelt s youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma   He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death  which terrified both Theodore and his parents  Doctors had no cure    Nevertheless  he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive    His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market  after obtaining the seal s head  Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the  Roosevelt Museum of Natural History   Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy   he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught  he then studied the animals and prepared them for display  At age nine  he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled  The Natural History of Insects      Roosevelt s father significantly influenced him  His father had been a prominent leader in New York s cultural affairs  he helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art  and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union war effort  Roosevelt wrote   My father  Theodore Roosevelt  was the best man I ever knew  He combined strength and courage with gentleness  tenderness  and great unselfishness  He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty  idleness  cowardice  or untruthfulness   Family trips abroad  including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870  and Egypt in 1872  also had a lasting impact    Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869  Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father  He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits      With encouragement from his father  Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise  After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip  he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his weakened body       Roosevelt later articulated the abiding influence of the courageous men he read about  including those in his family   I was nervous and timid  Yet from reading of the people I admiredranging from the soldiers of Valley Forge and Morgan s riflemen  to the heroes of my favorite storiesand from hearing of the feats of my southern forefathers and kinsfolk and from knowing my father  I felt a great admiration for men who were fearless and who could hold their own in the world  and I had a great desire to be like them      Roosevelt was mostly home schooled by tutors and his parents  Biographer H  W  Brands argues that  The most obvious drawback to the home schooling Roosevelt received was uneven coverage of the various areas of human knowledge     He was solid in geography  as a result of self study during travels   and bright in history  biology  French  and German  however  he struggled in mathematics and the classical languages  He entered Harvard College on September 27  1876  his father told him  Take care of your morals first  your health next  and finally your studies      After recovering from devastation over his father s death on February 9  1878  Roosevelt doubled his activities  He did well in science  philosophy  and rhetoric courses but continued to struggle in Latin and Greek  He studied biology intently and was already an accomplished naturalist and a published ornithologist  he read prodigiously with an almost photographic memory    While at Harvard  Roosevelt participated in rowing and boxing   he was once runner up in a Harvard boxing tournament  Roosevelt was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi literary society  the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity  and the Porcellian Club   he was also an editor of The Harvard Advocate   On June 30  1880  Roosevelt graduated Phi Beta Kappa  22nd of 177  from Harvard with an A B  magna cum laude      He entered Columbia Law School   and was an able student  but he often found law to be irrational  he spent much of his time writing a book on the War of 1812  Roosevelt eventually became entirely disenchanted with law and diverted his attention to politics at Morton Hall on 59th Street  the headquarters for New York s 21st District Republican Association  When the members of the association encouraged him to run for public office  he dropped out of law school to do so  later saying   I intended to be one of the governing class      While at Harvard  Roosevelt began a systematic study of the role played by the nascent US Navy in the War of 1812   largely completing two chapters of a book he published after graduation      Assisted by two uncles  he scrutinized original source materials and official US Navy records  Roosevelt s carefully researched book  published in 1882  was comparable to modern doctoral dissertations   complete with drawings of individual and combined ship maneuvers  charts depicting the differences in iron throw weights of cannon shot between American and British forces  and analyses of the differences between English and American leadership down to the ship to ship level  Published after Roosevelt s graduation from Harvard  The Naval War of 1812 was praised for its scholarship and style  and it showed Roosevelt to be a scholar of history  One modern naval historian wrote   Roosevelt s study of the War of 1812 influenced all subsequent scholarship on the naval aspects of the War of 1812 and continues to be reprinted  More than a classic  it remains  after 120 years  a standard study of the war     Roosevelt summarized one of the primary morals of the war   It must be but a poor spirited American whose veins do not tingle with pride when he reads of the cruises and fights of the sea captains  and their grim prowess  which kept the old Yankee flag floating over the waters of the Atlantic for three years  in the teeth of the mightiest naval power the world has ever seen      On his 22nd birthday  Roosevelt married socialite Alice Hathaway Lee   daughter of banker George Cabot Lee and Caroline Watts Haskell  Their daughter  Alice Lee Roosevelt   was born on February 12  1884  Roosevelt s wife died two days after giving birth due to an undiagnosed case of kidney failure  called Bright s disease at the time   which had been masked by the pregnancy  In his diary  Roosevelt wrote a large  X  on the page and then   The light has gone out of my life   His mother  Mittie  had died of typhoid fever eleven hours earlier at 3 00a m   in the same house  Distraught  Roosevelt left baby Alice in the care of his sister Bamie in New York City while he grieved  He assumed custody of his daughter when she was three     Roosevelt also reacted by focusing on work  specifically by re energizing a legislative investigation into corruption of the New York City government  which arose from a concurrent bill proposing that power be centralized in the mayor s office    For the rest of his life  he rarely spoke about his wife Alice and did not write about her in his autobiography  While working with Joseph Bucklin Bishop on a biography that included a collection of his letters  Roosevelt did not mention his marriage to Alice nor his second marriage to Edith Kermit Carow      Roosevelt was soon put forth as the Republican party s candidate for the District s House seat in Albany    He was a member of the New York State Assembly  New York Co   21st D   in 1882   1883 and 1884   He immediately began making his mark  specifically in corporate corruption issues    He blocked a corrupt effort by financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes  Roosevelt exposed suspected collusion in the matter by Judge Theodore Westbrook  and argued for and received approval for an investigation to proceed  aiming for the impeachment of the judge  The investigation committee rejected impeachment  but Roosevelt had exposed the potential corruption in Albany  and thus assumed a high and positive political profile in multiple New York publications    In 1883  Roosevelt became the Assembly Minority Leader  In 1884  he lost the nomination for Speaker to Titus Sheard by a vote of 41 to 29 in the GOP caucus    Roosevelt was also Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of Cities  he wrote more bills than any other legislator     With numerous presidential hopefuls to choose from  Roosevelt supported Senator George F  Edmunds of Vermont  a colorless reformer  The GOP preferred New York City s Chester Arthur   who was known as a spoilsman  Roosevelt fought hard and succeeded in influencing the Manhattan delegates in the state convention at Utica  He then took control of the state convention  bargaining through the night and outmaneuvering the supporters of Arthur and James G  Blaine  he gained a national reputation as a key person in New York State     Roosevelt attended the GOP National Convention in 1884 and fought alongside the Mugwump reformers  they lost to the Stalwart faction  who nominated James G  Blaine   In a crucial moment of his budding political career  Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine  He bragged about his one small success   We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman    To do this needed a mixture of skill  boldness and energy    to get the different factions to come in    to defeat the common foe     He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand  the largest up to that date  Having gotten a taste of national politics  Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level  he then retired to his new  Chimney Butte Ranch  on the Little Missouri    Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland   the governor of New York and the Democratic nominee in the general election  He debated the pros and cons of staying loyal with his political friend  Henry Cabot Lodge   After Blaine won the nomination  Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give  hearty support to any decent Democrat   He distanced himself from the promise  saying that it had not been meant  for publication     When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine  Roosevelt replied   That question I decline to answer  It is a subject I do not care to talk about     In the end  he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP  and he did so in a press release on July 19     In 1886  Roosevelt was the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City  portraying himself as  The Cowboy of the Dakotas   GOP precinct workers warned voters that the independent radical candidate Henry George was leading and that Roosevelt would lose  thus causing a last minute defection of GOP voters to the Democratic candidate Abram Hewitt   Roosevelt took third place with 27   60 435 votes   Hewitt won with 41   90 552 votes   and George was held to 31   68 110 votes      Roosevelt built a second ranch named Elk Horn  thirty five miles  56km  north of the boomtown of Medora  North Dakota   On the banks of the Little Missouri   Roosevelt learned to ride western style  rope and hunt  though he earned the respect of the authentic cowboys  they were not overly impressed    However  he identified with the herdsman of history  a man he said possesses   few of the emasculated  milk and water moralities admired by the pseudo philanthropists  but he does possess  to a very high degree  the stern  manly qualities that are invaluable to a nation       He reoriented  and began writing about frontier life for national magazines  he also published three books  Hunting Trips of a Ranchman   Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail   and The Wilderness Hunter      As a deputy sheriff  Roosevelt pursued three outlaws who had stolen his riverboat and escaped north up the Little Missouri  He captured them  but decided against a vigilante hanging  instead  he sent his foreman back by boat  and conveyed the thieves to Dickinson for trial  He assumed guard over them for forty hours without sleep  while reading Leo Tolstoy to keep himself awake  When he ran out of his own books  he read a dime store western that one of the thieves was carrying    On another occasion  while searching for a group of relentless horse thieves  Roosevelt met Seth Bullock   the famous sheriff of Deadwood  South Dakota   The two would remain friends for life     Roosevelt brought his desire to address the common interests of citizens to the west  He successfully led efforts to organize ranchers to address the problems of overgrazing and other shared concerns  his work resulted in the formation of the Little Missouri Stockmen s Association  He was also compelled to coordinate conservation efforts and was able to form the Boone and Crockett Club   whose primary goal was the conservation of large game animals and their habitats    After the uniquely severe US winter of 18861887 wiped out his herd of cattle and those of his competitors  and with it over half of his  80 000 investment  Roosevelt returned to the East       On December 2  1886  Roosevelt married his childhood and family friend  Edith Kermit Carow  August 6  1861  September 30  1948   a daughter of Charles Carow and Gertrude Elizabeth Tyler    The couple married at St George s  Hanover Square in London  England  English diplomat Cecil Arthur Spring Rice   Roosevelt s close friend  served as best man    The couple honeymooned in Europe  and while there  Roosevelt led a group to the summit of Mont Blanc   an achievement that resulted in his induction into the Royal Society of London     They had five children  Theodore  Ted  III  18871944   Kermit  18891943   Ethel  18911977   Archibald  18941979   and Quentin  18971918   At the time of Ted s birth  Roosevelt was both eager and worried for Edith after losing his first wife  Alice  shortly after childbirth     In the 1888 presidential election   Roosevelt successfully campaigned  primarily in the Midwest  for Benjamin Harrison   President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the United States Civil Service Commission   where he served until 1895  While in office  Roosevelt vigorously fought the spoilsmen and demanded enforcement of civil service laws    The New York Sun then described Roosevelt as  irrepressible  belligerent  and enthusiastic     Despite Roosevelt s support for Harrison s reelection bid in the presidential election of 1892   the eventual winner  Grover Cleveland  a Bourbon Democrat    reappointed him to the same post    Roosevelt s close friend and biographer  Joseph Bucklin Bishop   described his assault on the spoils system   The very citadel of spoils politics  the hitherto impregnable fortress that had existed unshaken since it was erected on the foundation laid by Andrew Jackson  was tottering to its fall under the assaults of this audacious and irrepressible young man    Whatever may have been the feelings of the  fellow Republican party  President  Harrison and there is little doubt that he had no idea when he appointed Roosevelt that he would prove to be so veritable a bull in a china shophe refused to remove him and stood by him firmly till the end of his term     In 1894  a group of reform Republicans approached Roosevelt about running for Mayor of New York again  he declined  mostly due to his wife s resistance to being removed from the Washington social set  Soon after he declined  he realized that he had missed an opportunity to reinvigorate a dormant political career  He retreated to the Dakotas for a time  his wife Edith regretted her role in the decision and vowed that there would be no repeat of it     Roosevelt became president of the board of the New York City Police Commissioners for two years in 1895 and radically reformed the police force  The New York Police Department   NYPD   was reputed as one of the most corrupt in America  the NYPD s history division records that Roosevelt was  an iron willed leader of unimpeachable honesty   who  brought a reforming zeal to the New York City Police Commission in 1895     Roosevelt implemented regular inspections of firearms and annual physical exams  he appointed 1 600 recruits based on their physical and mental qualifications  regardless of political affiliation  established Meritorious Service Medals and closed corrupt police hostelries  During his tenure  a Municipal Lodging House was established by the Board of Charities  and Roosevelt required officers to register with the Board  he also had telephones installed in station houses     In 1894  Roosevelt met Jacob Riis   the muckraking Evening Sun newspaper journalist who was opening the eyes of New Yorkers to the terrible conditions of the city s millions of poor immigrants with such books as How the Other Half Lives   Riis described how his book affected Roosevelt   When Roosevelt read  my  book  he came    No one ever helped as he did  For two years we were brothers in  New York City s crime ridden  Mulberry Street   When he left I had seen its golden age    There is very little ease where Theodore Roosevelt leads  as we all of us found out  The lawbreaker found it out who predicted scornfully that he would  knuckle down to politics the way they all did   and lived to respect him  though he swore at him  as the one of them all who was stronger than pull    that was what made the age golden  that for the first time a moral purpose came into the street  In the light of it everything was transformed     Roosevelt made a habit of walking officers  beats late at night and early in the morning to make sure that they were on duty    He made a concerted effort to uniformly enforce New York s Sunday closing law   in this  he ran up against boss Tom Platt as well as Tammany Hall he was notified that the Police Commission was being legislated out of existence  Roosevelt chose to defer rather than split with his party    As Governor of New York State before becoming Vice President in March 1901  Roosevelt signed an act replacing the Police Commissioners with a single Police Commissioner     Roosevelt had demonstrated  through his research and writing  a fascination with naval history  President William McKinley  urged by Roosevelt s close friend Congressman Henry Cabot Lodge  appointed Roosevelt as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897    Secretary of the Navy John D  Long was more concerned about formalities than functions  was in poor health  and left major decisions to Roosevelt  Roosevelt seized the opportunity and began pressing his national security views regarding the Pacific and the Caribbean on McKinley  Roosevelt was particularly adamant that Spain be ejected from Cuba  to foster the latter s independence and to demonstrate the U S  resolve to reenforce the Monroe Doctrine     Ten days after the battleship Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana  Cuba  the Secretary left the office and Roosevelt became Acting Secretary for four hours  Roosevelt cabled the Navy worldwide to prepare for war  ordered ammunition and supplies  brought in experts and went to Congress asking for the authority to recruit as many sailors as he wanted    Roosevelt was instrumental in preparing the Navy for the SpanishAmerican War   Roosevelt had an analytical mind  even as he was itching for war  He explained his priorities to one of the Navy s planners in late 1897   I would regard war with Spain from two viewpoints  first  the advisability on the grounds both of humanity and self interest of interfering on behalf of the Cubans  and of taking one more step toward the complete freeing of America from European dominion  second  the benefit done our people by giving them something to think of which is not material gain  and especially the benefit done our military forces by trying both the Navy and Army in actual practice     Prior to his service in the SpanishAmerican War   Roosevelt had already seen reserve military service from 1882 to 1886 with the New York National Guard   Commissioned on August 1  1882 as a 2nd Lieutenant with B Company  8th Regiment  he was promoted to Captain and company commander a year later  and he remained in command until he resigned his commission             When the United States and Spain declared war against each other in late April 1898  Roosevelt resigned from his civilian leadership job with the Navy on May 6 and formed the First US Volunteer Cavalry Regiment along with Army Colonel Leonard Wood     Referred to by the press as the  Rough Riders   the regiment was one of many temporary units active only for the duration of the war     After securing modern multiple round Krag smokeless carbines  Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt arrived on May 15    The regiment trained for several weeks in San Antonio  Texas  and in his autobiography Roosevelt wrote that his prior National Guard experience had been invaluable  in that it enabled him to immediately begin teaching his men basic soldiering skills    The Rough Riders used some standard issue gear and some of their own design  purchased with gift money  Diversity characterized the regiment  which included Ivy Leaguers  professional and amateur athletes  upscale gentlemen as well as cowboys  frontiersmen  Native Americans  hunters  miners  prospectors  former soldiers  tradesmen  and sheriffs  The Rough Riders were part of the cavalry division commanded by former Confederate general Joseph Wheeler   It was one of three divisions in the V Corps under Lieutenant General William Rufus Shafter   Roosevelt and his men departed Tampa on June 13  landed in Daiquiri   Cuba  on June 23  1898  and marched to Siboney  Wheeler sent parts of the 1st and 10th Regular Cavalry on the lower road northwest and sent the  Rough Riders  on the parallel road running along a ridge up from the beach  To throw off his infantry rival  Wheeler left one regiment of his Cavalry Division  the 9th  at Siboney so that he could claim that his move north was only a limited reconnaissance if things went wrong  Roosevelt was promoted to colonel and took command of the regiment when Wood was put in command of the brigade   The Rough Riders had a short  minor skirmish known as the Battle of Las Guasimas   they fought their way through Spanish resistance and  together with the Regulars  forced the Spaniards to abandon their positions     Under his leadership  the Rough Riders became famous for the charge up Kettle Hill on July 1  1898  while supporting the regulars  Roosevelt had the only horse  and rode back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up Kettle Hill  an advance that he urged despite the absence of any orders from superiors  He was forced to walk up the last part of Kettle Hill  because his horse had been entangled in barbed wire  The victories came at a cost of 200 killed and 1000 wounded     Roosevelt commented on his role in the battles   On the day of the big fight I had to ask my men to do a deed that European military writers consider utterly impossible of performance  that is  to attack over open ground an unshaken infantry armed with the best modern repeating rifles behind a formidable system of entrenchments  The only way to get them to do it in the way it had to be done was to lead them myself      In August  Roosevelt and other officers demanded that the soldiers be returned home  Roosevelt always recalled the Battle of Kettle Hill  part of the San Juan Heights  as  the great day of my life  and  my crowded hour   In 2001  Roosevelt was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions  he had been nominated during the war  but Army officials  annoyed at his grabbing the headlines  blocked it    After returning to civilian life  Roosevelt preferred to be known as  Colonel Roosevelt  or  The Colonel   However   Teddy  remained much more popular with the public  even though Roosevelt openly despised it  Men working closely with Roosevelt customarily called him  Colonel  or  Theodore      After leaving the Army  Roosevelt discovered that New York Republicans needed him  because their current governor was tainted by scandal and would probably lose  He campaigned vigorously on his war record  winning the 1898 state election by a historical margin of 1      As governor  Roosevelt learned much about ongoing economic issues and political techniques that later proved valuable in his presidency  He was exposed to the problems of trusts  monopolies  labor relations  and conservation  Chessman argues that Roosevelt s program  rested firmly upon the concept of the square deal by a neutral state   The rules for the Square Deal were  honesty in public affairs  an equitable sharing of privilege and responsibility  and subordination of party and local concerns to the interests of the state at large      By holding twice daily press conferenceswhich was an innovationRoosevelt remained connected with his middle class political base    Roosevelt successfully pushed the Ford Franchise Tax bill  which taxed public franchises granted by the state and controlled by corporations  declaring that  a corporation which derives its powers from the State  should pay to the State a just percentage of its earnings as a return for the privileges it enjoys     He rejected  boss  Thomas C  Platt  s worries that this approached Bryanite Socialism  explaining that without it  New York voters might get angry and adopt public ownership of streetcar lines and other franchises     The New York state government affected many interests  and the power to make appointments to policy making positions was a key role for the governor  Platt insisted that he be consulted  Roosevelt appeared to comply  but then made his own decisions  Historians marvel that Roosevelt managed to appoint so many first rate men with Platt s approval  He even enlisted Platt s help in securing reform  such as in the spring of 1899  when Platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service bill that the secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association called  superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in America      Chessman argues that as governor  Roosevelt developed the principles that shaped his presidency  especially insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations  publicity as a first remedy for trusts  regulation of railroad rates  mediation of the conflict of capital and labor  conservation of natural resources and protection of the less fortunate members of society     In November 1899  William McKinley  s first Vice President Garret Hobart died of heart failure  Theodore Roosevelt had anticipated a second term as governor or  alternatively  a cabinet post in the War Department  his friends  especially Henry Cabot Lodge   saw this as a dead end  They supported him for Vice President  and no one else of prominence was actively seeking that job  Some people in the GOP wanted Roosevelt as Vice President  His friends were pushing  and so were his foes  Roosevelt s reforming zeal ran afoul of the insurance and franchise businesses  who had a major voice in the New York GOP  Platt engineered Roosevelt s removal from the state by pressuring him to accept the GOP nomination as Vice President in 1900  McKinley refused to consider Roosevelt as Secretary of War  but saw no risk in making him Vice President  Roosevelt accepted the nomination  although his campaign manager  Mark Hanna   thought Roosevelt was too cowboy like  While the party executives were pleased with their success in engineering Roosevelt s next political foray  Roosevelt  very much to the contrary  thought he had  stood the state machine on its head      The office of Vice President was a powerless sinecure  and did not suit Roosevelt s aggressive temperament    However  campaigning for the position added to his skills  Roosevelt threw himself into the campaign with his accustomed energy  crisscrossing the nation denouncing the radicalism of William Jennings Bryan   in contrast to the heroism of the soldiers and sailors who fought and won the war against Spain  Bryan had strongly supported the war itself  but he denounced the annexation of the Philippines as imperialism  which would spoil America s innocence  Roosevelt countered that it was best for the Filipinos to have stability  and the Americans to have a proud place in the world  With the nation basking in peace and prosperity  the voters gave McKinley an even larger landslide than in 1896    Roosevelt s six months as Vice President  March to September 1901  were uneventful with one singular exception    On September 2  1901  Roosevelt first publicized an aphorism that thrilled his supporters    Speak softly and carry a big stick  and you will go far      On September 6  President McKinley was shot by an anarchist acting alone while in Buffalo  New York  Initial reports suggested that his condition was improving  so Roosevelt  after visiting the ailing president  embarked for the west  When McKinley s condition worsened  Roosevelt rushed back  McKinley died on September 14  and Roosevelt was sworn in at the Ansley Wilcox House     The following month  Roosevelt invited Booker T  Washington to dinner at the White House  To his dismay  this sparked a bitter  and at times vicious  reaction across the heavily segregated South  Roosevelt reacted with astonishment and protest  saying that he looked forward to many future dinners with Washington  Upon further reflection  Roosevelt wanted to ensure that this had no effect on political support in the South  and further invitations to Washington were avoided    Roosevelt kept McKinley s Cabinet and promised to continue McKinley s policies  In the November 1904 presidential election   Roosevelt won the presidency in his own right in a landslide victory against Alton Brooks Parker   His vice president was Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana     One of Roosevelt s first notable acts as president was to deliver a 20 000 word address to Congress   asking it to curb the power of large corporations  called  trusts    He also spoke in support of organized labor to further chagrin big business  but to their delight  he endorsed the gold standard  protective tariffs and lower taxes    For his aggressive use of United States antitrust law   he became known as the  trust buster   He brought 40 antitrust suits  and broke up major companies  such as the largest railroad and Standard Oil   the largest oil company     In May 1902  anthracite coal miners went on strike  threatening a national energy shortage  After threatening the coal operators with intervention by federal troops  Roosevelt won their agreement to an arbitration of the dispute by a commission  which succeeded in stopping the strike  dropping coal prices and retiring furnaces  the accord with J P  Morgan resulted in the workers getting more pay for fewer hours  but with no union recognition      Journalist Ray Baker quoted Roosevelt concerning his policy towards capitalists and laborers   My action on labor should always be considered in connection with my action as regards capital  and both are reducible to my favorite formulaa square deal for every man     Roosevelt thought it was particularly important for the government to supervise the workings of the railway to avoid corruption in interstate commerce  the result was the Hepburn bill  which established control over railroad rates     Roosevelt responded to public anger over the abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act   The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals  The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made  sold  and shipped  Roosevelt also served as honorary president of the American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908  and in 1909 he convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children     During the Panic of 1907   nearly all agreed that a more flexible system to ensure liquidity was neededthe Republicans sought a response to the money supply through the bankers  whereas the Democrats sought government control  Roosevelt was unsure  but leaned towards the Republican view while continuing to denounce corporate corruption    Nonetheless  in 1910  Roosevelt commented on  enormously wealthy and economically powerful men  and suggested  a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes    increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate        Roosevelt was inclined to extend the regulatory reach of his office  In a moment of frustration  House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon commented on Roosevelt s desire for executive branch control in domestic policy making   That fellow at the other end of the avenue wants everything from the birth of Christ to the death of the devil   Biographer Brands states that   Even his friends occasionally wondered whether there wasn t any custom or practice too minor for him to try to regulate  update or otherwise improve     In fact  Roosevelt s willingness to exercise his power included attempted rule changes in the game of football  at the Naval Academy  he sought to force retention of martial arts classes and to revise disciplinary rules  He even ordered changes made in the minting of a coin whose design he disliked  and ordered the Government Printing Office to adopt simplified spellings for a core list of 300 words  according to reformers on the Simplified Spelling Board   He was forced to rescind the latter after substantial ridicule from the press and a resolution of protest from the House of Representatives     Of all Roosevelt s achievements  he was proudest of his work in conservation of natural resources  and extending Federal protection to land and wildlife  Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service   signed into law the creation of five National Parks   and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act   under which he proclaimed 18 new U S  National Monuments   He also established the first 51 Bird Reserves   four Game Preserves   and 150 National Forests   including Shoshone National Forest   the nation s first  The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately 230 000 000 acres  930 000km 2    He worked closely with Gifford Pinchot      In the late 1890s  Roosevelt had been an ardent imperialist  and vigorously defended the permanent acquisition of the Philippines in the 1900 election campaign  After the rebellion ended in 1901  he largely lost interest in the Philippines and Asian expansion in general  despite the contradictory opinion of his Secretary of War  William Howard Taft  As president  he primarily focused the nation s overseas ambitions on the Caribbean  especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project  the Panama Canal      In 1905  Roosevelt offered to mediate a treaty to end the Russo Japanese War   The parties agreed to meet in Portsmouth   New Hampshire and they resolved the final conflict over the division of Sakhalin  Russia took the northern half  and Japan the south  Japan also dropped its demand for an indemnity    Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for his successful efforts  George E  Mowry concludes that Roosevelt handled the arbitration well  doing an  excellent job of balancing Russian and Japanese power in the Orient  where the supremacy of either constituted a threat to growing America        The Gentlemen s Agreement of 1907 resolved unpleasant racial tensions with Japan  Tokyo was angered over the segregation of Japanese children in San Francisco schools  The tensions were ended  but Japan also agreed not to allow unskilled workers to emigrate to the U S     Roosevelt s attention concerning Latin American turmoil was heightened by his plans for building a canal  In December 1902  the Germans   English   and Italians sought to impose a naval blockade against Venezuela in order to force the repayment of delinquent loans  Roosevelt was particularly concerned with the motives of Germany s Kaiser Wilhelm   He succeeded in getting the aggressors to agree to arbitration by a tribunal at The Hague   and averted the Venezuela Crisis of 19021903     The latitude granted to the Europeans by the arbiters was in part responsible for the   Roosevelt Corollary   to the Monroe Doctrine   which the President issued in 1904   Chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society  may in America  as elsewhere  ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation  and in the Western Hemisphere  the adherence of the United States to the Monroe doctrine may force the United States  however reluctantly  in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence  to the exercise of an international police power      The pursuit of an isthmus canal in Central America during this period focused on two possible routes Nicaragua and Panama   which was then a rebellious district within Colombia   Roosevelt convinced Congress to approve the Panamanian alternative  and a treaty was approved  only to be rejected by the Colombian government  When the Panamanians learned of this  a rebellion followed  was supported by Roosevelt  and succeeded  A treaty with the new Panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903     In 1906  following a disputed election  an insurrection ensued in Cuba   Roosevelt sent Taft  the Secretary of War  to monitor the situation  he was convinced that he had the authority to unilaterally authorize Taft to deploy Marines if necessary  without congressional approval     Examining the work of numerous scholars  Ricard  2014  reports that   The most striking evolution in the twenty first century historiography of Theodore Roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasi unanimous celebration of the master diplomatist      Regarding British relations these studies  have underlined cogently Roosevelt s exceptional statesmanship in the construction of the nascent twentieth century  special relationship      The twenty sixth president s reputation as a brilliant diplomatist and realpolitician has undeniably reached new heights in the twenty first century   yet  his Philippine policy still prompts criticism     Building on McKinley s effective use of the press  Roosevelt made the White House the center of news every day  providing interviews and photo opportunities  After noticing the reporters huddled outside the White House in the rain one day  he gave them their own room inside  effectively inventing the presidential press briefing  The grateful press  with unprecedented access to the White House  rewarded Roosevelt with ample coverage     Roosevelt normally enjoyed very close relationships with the press  which he used to keep in daily contact with his middle class base  While out of office  he made a living as a writer and magazine editor  He loved talking with intellectuals  authors  and writers  He drew the line  however  at expose oriented scandal mongering journalists who  during his term  set magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians  mayors  and corporations  Roosevelt himself was not usually a target  but his speech in 1906 coined the term   muckraker   for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges   The liar   he said   is no whit better than the thief  and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves      The press did briefly target Roosevelt in one instance  Ever since 1904  he had been periodically criticized for the manner in which he facilitated the Panama Canal  In the least judicious use of executive power  according to biographer Brands  Roosevelt  near the end of his term  demanded that the Justice Department bring charges of criminal libel against Joseph Pulitzer s New York World   The publication had accused him of  deliberate misstatements of fact  in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the Panama affair  Though indictment was obtained  the case was ultimately dismissed in federal courtit was not a federal offense  but one enforceable at the state court level  The Justice Department had predicted that result  and had also advised Roosevelt accordingly     The control and management of the Republican Party lay in the hands of chairman Mark Hanna until McKinley s death  Hanna s domination  and potential rivalry for the party s nomination in 1904  began to wane with his own health issues and ultimate death early that year  In deference to Hanna s conservative loyalists  Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to Cornelius Bliss   but he declined  Roosevelt then turned to his own man  George B  Cortelyou of New York  the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor  To buttress his hold on the party s nomination  Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered to be opposing the President    The President secured his own nomination  but his preferred vice presidential running mate  Robert R  Hitt   wasn t nominated  Charles Warren Fairbanks was nominated     While Roosevelt followed the tradition of incumbents in not actively campaigning on the stump  he sought to control the campaign s message through specific instructions to Cortelyou  He also attempted to manage the press s release of White House statements by forming the Ananias Club  Any journalist who repeated a statement made by the president without approval was penalized by restriction of further access     The Democratic Party s nominee in 1904 was Alton Brooks Parker   Roosevelt won 56  of the popular vote  and Parker received 38   Roosevelt also won the Electoral College vote  336 to 140  Before his inauguration ceremony  Roosevelt declared that he would not serve another term     Before leaving office  while attempting to push through the nomination of William Howard Taft for the Presidency in 1908   Roosevelt declared Taft to be a  genuine progressive   In January of that year  Roosevelt wrote the following to Taft   Dear Will  Do you want any action about those federal officials  I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word   Just weeks later he branded as  false and malicious   the charge was that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft     Taft easily defeated three time candidate William Jennings Bryan  Taft promoted a different progressivism  one that stressed the rule of law and preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness  Taft usually proved to be a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism  along with the publicity devices  the dedicated supporters  and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable  When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers  manufacturers and farmers  against merchants and consumers  he stopped talking about the issue  Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly  encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates  and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high  The resulting Payne Aldrich tariff of 1909 was too high for most reformers  but instead of blaming this on Senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich and big businesses  Taft took credit  calling it the best tariff ever  He again had managed to alienate all sides  While the crisis was building inside the Party  Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe  to allow Taft to be his own man     Roosevelt had attempted to refashion Taft into a younger version of himself  but as soon as Taft began to display his individuality  Roosevelt unveiled his disenchantment  He was even offended on election night when Taft wrote and indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of Roosevelt  but also his brother Charley  Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft  again intent on becoming his own man  did not consult him about cabinet appointments  Lodge empathized with Roosevelt  and therefore declined an offer to become Secretary of State     Unlike Roosevelt  Taft never attacked business or businessmen in his rhetoric  However  he was attentive to the law  so he launched 90 antitrust suits  including one against the largest corporation  US Steel  for an acquisition that Roosevelt had personally approved  Consequently  Taft lost the support of antitrust reformers  who disliked his conservative rhetoric   of big business  which disliked his actions   and of Roosevelt  who felt humiliated by his protg  More trouble came when Taft fired Roosevelt s friend and appointee Gifford Pinchot   a leading conservationist  Pinchot alleged that Taft s Secretary of the Interior  Richard Ballinger   was in league with big timber interests  Conservationists sided with Pinchot  and Taft alienated yet another vocal constituency  The left wing of the Republican Party began turning against Taft  Senator Robert M  La Follette Sr  of Wisconsin joined with Pinchot  William White and Hiram Johnson to create the National Progressive Republican League  their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level  Roosevelt declined to join this grouphe was still reluctant to leave the GOP    Roosevelt  back from Europe  unexpectedly launched an attack on the courts  He gave his famous speech at Osawatomie  Kansas  in August 1910  which was the most radical of his career and openly initiated his break with the Taft administration and the conservative Republicans  Osawatomie was well known as the base used by John Brown when he launched his bloody attacks on slavery  Advocating a program of  New Nationalism   Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests  a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination  and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions     Roosevelt shortly thereafter made it clear in a meeting with Lloyd Carpenter Griscom   a New York Republican regular  that Taft no longer enjoyed his support  since he had  deliberately abandoned  their previous close relations    Taft was deeply upset  In the 1910 Congressional elections  Democrats won a majority in the House  and significantly diminished the Republican s hold on the Senate  Taft s reelection in 1912 was doubtful  The Republican progressives interpreted the defeat as compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the party in 1911  and Roosevelt reacted with renewed interest in more personal political endeavors    Despite skepticism of La Follette s new League  Roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles  in fact  between January and April 1911  Roosevelt wrote a series of articles for The Outlook   defending what he called  the great movement of our day  the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege  and in favor of an honest and efficient political and industrial democracy      In March 1909  shortly after the end of his presidency  Roosevelt left New York for the Smithsonian Roosevelt African Expedition   a safari in east and central Africa outfitted by the Smithsonian Institution     Roosevelt s party landed in Mombasa   British East Africa  now Kenya    traveled to the Belgian Congo  now Democratic Republic of the Congo    before following the Nile to Khartoum in modern Sudan   Financed by Andrew Carnegie and by his own writings  Roosevelt s party hunted for specimens for the Smithsonian Institution and for the American Museum of Natural History in New York    The group  led by the legendary hunter tracker RJ Cunninghame  included scientists from the Smithsonian  and was joined from time to time by Frederick Selous   the famous big game hunter and explorer  Among other items  Roosevelt brought with him four tons of salt for preserving animal hides  a lucky rabbit s foot given to him by boxer John L  Sullivan   a Holland   Holland double rifle in  500 450 donated by a group of 56 admiring Britons  a Winchester 1895 rifle in  405 Winchester   an Army   M1903   Springfield in  30 06 caliber stocked and sighted for him  a Fox No  12 shotgun  and the famous Pigskin Library  a collection of classics bound in pig leather and transported in a single reinforced trunk  Participants on the expedition included Kermit Roosevelt   Edgar Alexander Mearns   Edmund Heller   and John Alden Loring      Roosevelt and his companions killed or trapped approximately 11 400   animals  from insects and moles to hippopotamuses and elephants  The 1000 large animals included 512 big game animals  including six rare White rhinos   Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to Washington  it took years to mount them all  and the Smithsonian shared many duplicate specimens with other museums  Regarding the large number of animals taken  Roosevelt said   I can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum   the American Museum of Natural History   and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned      Although the safari was ostensibly conducted in the name of science   it was as much a political and social event as it was a hunting excursion  Roosevelt interacted with renowned professional hunters and land owning families  and met many native peoples and local leaders  Roosevelt became a life member of the National Rifle Association in 1907    He wrote a detailed account of the safari in the book African Game Trails   recounting the excitement of the chase  the people he met  and the flora and fauna he collected in the name of science     In November 1911  a group of Ohio Republicans endorsed Roosevelt for the party s nomination for president  the endorsers included James R  Garfield and Dan Hanna  This was notable  in that it emanated from Taft s home state  Roosevelt conspicuously declined to make a statement requested by Garfieldthat he flatly refuse a nomination  Soon thereafter  Roosevelt said   I am really sorry for Taft    I am sure he means well  but he means well feebly  and he does not know how  He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership   In January 1912  Roosevelt declared  if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve     Later that year Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio  openly referred to himself as a progressive and endorsed progressive reformseven endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions    In reaction to Roosevelt s proposals for popular overrule of court decisions  Taft said   such extremists are not progressivesthey are political emotionalists or neurotics      Roosevelt began to envision himself as the savior of the Republican party  the  GOP   from defeat in the upcoming Presidential election and announced himself as a candidate for the GOP banner  In February 1912  Roosevelt announced in Boston  I will accept the nomination for president if it is tendered to me  I hope that so far as possible the people may be given the chance through direct primaries to express who shall be the nominee      Both Elihu Root and Cabot Lodge could then see the ultimate defeat of the party in the next election due to this lethal division  Taft considered that he was witnessing the end of his careerit was only a matter of whether he would be defeated by his own party or in the general election     The 1912 primaries represented the first extensive use of the presidential primary   a reform achievement of the progressive movement  The primaries in the South  where party regulars dominated  went for Taft  as well as New York  Indiana  Michigan  Kentucky and Massachusetts  Meanwhile  Roosevelt won in Illinois  Minnesota  Nebraska  South Dakota  California  Maryland and Pennsylvania  Roosevelt also won Taft s home state of Ohio  These primary elections  while demonstrating Roosevelt s continuing popularity with the electorate  were not pivotal  The final credentials of the state delegates at the national convention were determined by the national committee  which was controlled by the party leaders  headed by the incumbent president  At the Republican Convention in Chicago   though Taft s victory was not immediate  the ultimate outcome was inevitably in his favor     Once his defeat as the GOP nominee was probable  Roosevelt announced that he would  accept the progressive nomination on a progressive platform and I shall fight to the end  win or lose   At the same time  Roosevelt prophetically said   My feeling is that the Democrats will probably win if they nominate a progressive     After two weeks at the GOP convention  Roosevelt asked his followers to leave the hall  and they moved to the Auditorium Theatre   Then Roosevelt  along with key allies such as Pinchot and Albert Beveridge created the Progressive Party  structuring it as a permanent organization that would field complete tickets at the presidential and state level  It was popularly known as the  Bull Moose Party   which got its name after Roosevelt told reporters   I m as fit as a bull moose     At the convention Roosevelt cried out   We stand at Armageddon and we battle for the Lord   Roosevelt s platform echoed his 19078 proposals  calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from the selfish interests   To destroy this invisible Government  to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day      This country belongs to the people  Its resources  its business  its laws  its institutions  should be utilized  maintained  or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest  This assertion is explicit    Mr  Wilson must know that every monopoly in the United States opposes the Progressive party    I challenge him    to name the monopoly that did support the Progressive party  whether    the Sugar Trust  the US Steel Trust  the Harvester Trust  the Standard Oil Trust  the Tobacco Trust  or any other    Ours was the only program to which they objected  and they supported either Mr  Wilson or Mr  Taft    On October 14  1912  while campaigning in Milwaukee  Wisconsin  Roosevelt was shot by a saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank   The bullet lodged in his chest after penetrating his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick  50 pages  single folded copy of the speech he was carrying in his jacket    Roosevelt  as an experienced hunter and anatomist  correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood  the bullet had not reached his lung  and he declined suggestions to go to the hospital immediately  Instead  he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt    He spoke for 90 minutes  His opening comments to the gathered crowd were   Ladies and gentlemen  I don t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot  but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose     Afterwards  probes and an x ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt s chest muscle  but did not penetrate the pleura   and it would be less dangerous to leave it in place  Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life     Because of the bullet wound  Roosevelt was taken off the campaign trail in the final weeks of the race  which ended on election day  November 5   Though the other two campaigners stopped their own campaigns during the week Roosevelt was in the hospital  they resumed it once he was released  The bullet lodged in his chest exacerbated his rheumatoid arthritis and prevented him from doing his daily stint of exercises  Roosevelt would soon become obese    In an era of party loyalty  Roosevelt failed to move enough Republicans to vote a third party ticket  He did win 4 1 million votes  27    compared to Taft s 3 5 million  23    However  Wilson s 6 3 million votes  42   were enough to garner 435 electoral votes  Roosevelt had 88 electoral votes  and Taft had 8  Pennsylvania was Roosevelt s only eastern state  in the Midwest  he carried Michigan  Minnesota  and South Dakota  in the West  California  and Washington  he did not win any southern states     A friend of Roosevelt s  Father John Augustine Zahm   a Catholic priest and scientist at the University of Notre Dame  had searched for new adventures and found them in the forests of South America  After a briefing of several of his own expeditions  he persuaded Roosevelt to participate in such an expedition in 1912  To finance the expedition  Roosevelt received support from the American Museum of Natural History   promising to bring back many new animal specimens  Roosevelt s popular book  Through the Brazilian Wilderness   describes his expedition into the Brazilian jungle in 1913 as a member of the Roosevelt Rondon Scientific Expedition   co named after its leader  Brazilian explorer Cndido Rondon   The book describes the scientific discovery  scenic tropical vistas  and exotic flora and fauna experienced during the adventure   Once in South America  a new  far more ambitious goal was added  to find the headwaters of the Rio da Duvida  the River of Doubt   and trace it north to the Madeira and thence to the Amazon River   It was later renamed Roosevelt River in honor of the former President  Roosevelt s crew consisted of his son Kermit   naturalist Colonel Rondon  George K  Cherrie  sent by the American Museum of Natural History   Brazilian Lieutenant Joo Lira  team physician Dr  Jos Antonio Cajazeira  and 16 skilled paddlers and porters  called camaradas  comrades  in Portuguese    The initial expedition started somewhat tenuously on December 9  1913  at the height of the rainy season  The trip down the River of Doubt started on February 27  1914     During the trip down the river  Roosevelt suffered a minor leg wound after he jumped into the river to try to prevent two canoes from smashing against the rocks  The flesh wound he received  however  soon gave him tropical fever that resembled the malaria he had contracted while in Cuba fifteen years before    Because the bullet lodged in his chest from the assassination attempt in 1912 was never removed  his health worsened from the infection    This weakened Roosevelt so greatly that six weeks into the adventure  he had to be attended to day and night by the expedition s physician and his son Kermit  By then  he could not walk because of the infection in his injured leg and an infirmity in the other  which was due to a traffic accident a decade earlier  Roosevelt was riddled with chest pains  fighting a fever that soared to 103F  39C  and at times made him delirious  Regarding his condition as a threat to the survival of the others  Roosevelt insisted he be left behind to allow the poorly provisioned expedition to proceed as rapidly as it could  Only an appeal by his son persuaded him to continue     Despite Roosevelt s continued decline and loss of over 50 pounds  20kg   Commander Rondon reduced the pace of the expedition to allow for his commission s mapmaking and other geographical tasks  which required regular stops to fix the expedition s position by sun based survey  Upon Roosevelt s return to New York  friends and family were startled by his physical appearance and fatigue  Roosevelt wrote  perhaps prophetically  to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years  For the rest of his few remaining years  he would be plagued by flare ups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe as to require surgery    Before Roosevelt had even completed his sea voyage home  critics raised doubts over his claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over 625 miles  1 000km  long  When he had recovered sufficiently  he addressed a standing room only convention organized in Washington  D C   by the National Geographic Society and satisfactorily defended his claims     When World War I began in 1914  Roosevelt strongly supported the Allies and demanded a harsher policy against Germany  especially regarding submarine warfare  Roosevelt angrily denounced the foreign policy of President Wilson  calling it a failure regarding the atrocities in Belgium and the violations of American rights    In 1916  he campaigned energetically for Charles Evans Hughes and repeatedly denounced Irish Americans and German Americans who Roosevelt said were unpatriotic  because they put the interests of Ireland and Germany ahead of America s by supporting neutrality  He insisted that one had to be 100  American  not a   hyphenated American   who juggled multiple loyalties  In March 1917  Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise a maximum of four divisions similar to the Rough Riders  and Major Frederick Russell Burnham was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment      However  the Commander in chief   President Woodrow Wilson   announced to the press that he would not send Roosevelt and his volunteers to France  but instead would send an American Expeditionary Force under the command of General John J  Pershing     Roosevelt was left with no option except to disband the volunteers  He never forgave Wilson  and quickly published The Foes Of Our Own Household   an indictment of the sitting president         Roosevelt s attacks on Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the off year elections of 1918  Roosevelt was popular enough to seriously contest the 1920 Republican nomination  but his health was broken by 1918  because of the lingering malaria   His family and supporters threw their support behind Roosevelt s old military companion  General Leonard Wood   who was ultimately defeated by Taft supporter Warren G  Harding     Roosevelt s youngest son  Quentin  a pilot with the American forces in France  was shot down behind German lines on July 14  1918  at the age of 20  It is said that Quentin s death distressed Roosevelt so much that he never recovered from his loss     On the night of January 5  1919  Roosevelt experienced breathing problems  He felt better after treatment from his physician  Dr  George W  Faller  and went to bed  Roosevelt s last words were  Please put out that light  James  to his family servant James Amos  Between 4 00 AM and 4 15 AM the next morning  Roosevelt died in his sleep at Sagamore Hill as a result of a blood clot detaching from a vein and traveling to his lungs    Upon receiving word of his death  his son Archibald telegraphed his siblings simply   The old lion is dead     Woodrow Wilson s vice president  Thomas R  Marshall   said that  Death had to take Roosevelt sleeping  for if he had been awake  there would have been a fight      Theodore Roosevelt introduced the phrase   Square Deal   to describe his progressive views in a speech delivered after leaving the office of the Presidency in August 1910  In his broad outline  he stressed equality of opportunity for all citizens and emphasized the importance of fair government regulations of corporate  special interests   Roosevelt was one of the first Presidents to make conservation a national issue  In his speech at Osawatomie  Kansas  on August 31  1910  he outlined his views on conservation of the lands of the United States  He favored using America s natural resources  but opposed wasteful consumption    One of his most lasting legacies was his significant role in the creation of 5 national parks  18 national monuments  and 150 National Forests  among other works of conservation  Roosevelt was instrumental in conserving about 230million acres  930 000km 2   of American soil among various parks and other federal projects    In the 21st century  historians have paid renewed attention to President Roosevelt as  The Wilderness Warrior  and his energetic promotion of the conservation movement  He collaborated with his chief advisor  Gifford Pinchot   the chief of the Forest Service  Pinchot and Roosevelt scheduled a series of news events that garnered nationwide media attention in magazines and newspapers  They used magazine articles  speeches  press conferences  interviews  and especially large scale presidential commissions  Roosevelt s goal was to encourage his middle class reform minded base to add conservation to their list of issues     In an 1894 article on immigration  Roosevelt said   We must Americanize in every way  in speech  in political ideas and principles  and in their way of looking at relations between church and state  We welcome the German and the Irishman who becomes an American  We have no use for the German or Irishman who remains such    He must revere only our flag  not only must it come first  but no other flag should even come second      Roosevelt took an active interest in immigration  and had launched an extensive reorganization of the federal immigration depot at Ellis Island within months of assuming the presidency  Roosevelt  straddled the immigration question     taking the position that  we cannot have too much immigration of the right sort  and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort     As president  his stated preferences were relatively inclusive  across the then diverse and mostly European sources of immigration   It is unwise to depart from the old American tradition and discriminate for or against any man who desires to come here and become a citizen  save on the ground of that man s fitness for citizenship    We can not afford to consider whether he is Catholic or Protestant  Jew or Gentile  whether he is Englishman or Irishman  Frenchman or German  Japanese  Italian  or Scandinavian or Magyar  What we should desire to find out is the individual quality of the individual man       He was the first president to appoint a Jewish cabinet memberSecretary of Commerce and Labor  Oscar Solomon Straus   who served from 1906 to 1909  Straus  who had helped co found the Immigration Protective League in 1898  was the Roosevelt Administration s cabinet official overseeing immigration  he helped secure the passage and implementation of the U S  Immigration Act of 1907          In 1886  Roosevelt criticized the morals of Indians he had seen   Regarding African Americans  Roosevelt told a civil rights leader   Roosevelt appointed numerous African Americans to federal offices  such as Walter L  Cohen of New Orleans  a leader of the Black and Tan Republican faction  whom Roosevelt named register of the federal land office     Contrasting the European conquest of North America with that of Australia  Roosevelt wrote   The natives  of Australia  were so few in number and of such a low type  that they practically offered no resistance at all  being but little more hindrance than an equal number of ferocious beasts     however  the Native Americans were  the most formidable savage foes ever faced ever encountered by colonists of European stock     He regarded slavery as  a crime whose shortsighted folly was worse than its guilt  because it  brought hordes of African slaves  whose descendants now form immense populations in certain portions of the land     Contrasting the European conquest of North America with that of South Africa  Roosevelt felt that the fate of the latter s colonists would be different because  unlike the Native American  the African  neither dies out nor recedes before their advance   meaning the colonists would likely  be swallowed up in the overwhelming mass of black barbarism      Roosevelt was intensely active in warning against race suicide  and held a Neo Lamarkist viewpoint    When Roosevelt used the word  race   he meant the entirety of the human race or Americans as one race and culture  Americans  he repeatedly said  were getting too soft and having too few children and were thus dying out  While he agreed with some of the ideas of eugenics  he strongly opposed the core eugenics movement principle that some people should have fewer children  As historian Thomas Dyer explains  Roosevelt   Strenuously dissented from the ideas which contravened the race suicide      And categorically rejected any measure which would not produce enough children to maintain racial integrity and national preeminence     Roosevelt attacked the fundamental axioms of eugenics  warning against  twisted eugenics      In 1914 he said   I wish very much that the wrong people could be prevented entirely from breeding  and when the evil nature of these people is sufficiently flagrant  this should be done  Criminals should be sterilized and feeble minded persons forbidden to leave offspring behind them        When Madison Grant published his book The Passing of the Great Race   Roosevelt wrote this to Scribner s Magazine to promote it   The book is a capital book  in purpose  in vision  in grasp of the facts our people most need to realize  It shows an extraordinary range of reading and a wide scholarship  It shows a habit of singular serious thought on the subject of most commanding importance  It shows a fine fearlessness in assailing the popular and mischievous sentimentalities and attractive and corroding falsehoods which few men dare assail  It is the work of an American scholar and gentleman  and all Americans should be sincerely grateful to you for writing it       Roosevelt was greatly impressed by the performance of ethnic American soldiers in the world war  Biographer Kathleen Dalton says   He insisted to  Madison  Grant that race and ethnicity did not matter because men of foreign parentage across the nation fought well  including Jews    Roosevelt took the final step toward believing in racial equality  At the end of his life TR repudiated the Madison Grants and other racists and promised W E B  DuBois to work with more energy for racial justice     Roosevelt was a prolific author  writing with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system  Roosevelt was also an avid reader of poetry   Poet Robert Frost said that Roosevelt  was our kind  He quoted poetry to me  He knew poetry      As an editor of Outlook magazine  Roosevelt had weekly access to a large  educated national audience  In all  Roosevelt wrote about 18 books  each in several editions   including his autobiography    The Rough Riders     History of the Naval War of 1812     and others on subjects such as ranching  explorations  and wildlife  His most ambitious book was the four volume narrative The Winning of the West   focused on the American frontier in the 18th and early 19th centuries  Roosevelt said that the American character  indeed a new  American race   ethnic group  had emerged from the heroic wilderness hunters and Indian fighters  acting on the frontier with little government help    Roosevelt also published an account of his 1909 10 African expedition entitled African Game Trails    In 1907  Roosevelt became embroiled in a widely publicized literary debate known as the nature fakers controversy   A few years earlier  naturalist John Burroughs had published an article entitled  Real and Sham Natural History  in the Atlantic Monthly   attacking popular writers of the day such as Ernest Thompson Seton   Charles G  D  Roberts   and William J  Long for their fantastical representations of wildlife  Roosevelt agreed with Burroughs  criticisms  and published several essays of his own denouncing the booming genre of  naturalistic  animal stories as  yellow journalism of the woods   It was the President himself who popularized the negative term  nature faker  to describe writers who depicted their animal characters with excessive anthropomorphism     Roosevelt intensely disliked being called  Teddy   and was quick to point out this fact to those who referred to him as such  though it would become widely used by newspapers during his political career  He attended church regularly  In 1907  concerning the motto  In God We Trust  on money  he wrote   It seems to me eminently unwise to cheapen such a motto by use on coins  just as it would be to cheapen it by use on postage stamps  or in advertisements   He was also a member of the Freemasons and Sons of the American Revolution      Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in pursuing what he called  in an 1899 speech    The Strenuous Life    To this end  he exercised regularly and took up boxing  tennis  hiking  rowing  polo  and horseback riding  As governor of New York  he boxed with sparring partners several times each week  a practice he regularly continued as President until being hit so hard in the face he became blind in his left eye  a fact not made public until many years later   Thereafter  he practiced judo  attaining a third degree brown belt  he also continued his habit of skinny dipping in the Potomac River during the winter       Roosevelt was an enthusiastic singlestick player and  according to Harper s Weekly   showed up at a White House reception with his arm bandaged after a bout with General Leonard Wood in 1905    Roosevelt was an avid reader  reading tens of thousands of books  at a rate of several per day in multiple languages  Along with Thomas Jefferson  Roosevelt was the most well read of all American politicians     Historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation s political system by permanently placing the presidency at center stage and making character as important as the issues  His notable accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism  He is a hero to liberals for his proposals in 190712 that presaged the modern welfare state of the New Deal Era  and put the environment on the national agenda  Conservatives admire his  big stick  diplomacy and commitment to military values  Dalton says   Today he is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency  as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet the needs of the new century and redefined America s place in the world      However  liberals have criticized him for his interventionist and imperialist approach to nations he considered  uncivilized   Conservatives reject his vision of the welfare state and emphasis on the superiority of government over private action  Historians typically rank Roosevelt among the top five presidents       Dalton says Roosevelt is remembered as   one of the most picturesque personalities who has ever enlivened the landscape     His friend  historian Henry Adams proclaimed  Roosevelt  more than any other man    showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matterthe quality that medieval theology assigned to Godhe was pure act     Recent biographers have stressed Roosevelt s personality  Cooper compared him with Woodrow Wilson  and discovered that both of them played the roles of warrior and priest    Dalton stressed Roosevelt s strenuous life    Sarah Watts examined the desires of the  Rough Rider in the White House     Brands calls Roosevelt  the last romantic   arguing that his romantic concept of life emerged from his belief that  physical bravery was the highest virtue and war the ultimate test of bravery      Roosevelt as the exemplar of American masculinity has become a major theme      As president  he repeatedly warned men that they were becoming too office bound  too complacent  too comfortable with physical ease and moral laxity  and were failing in their duties to propagate the race and exhibit masculine vigor    French historian Serge Ricard says   the ebullient apostle of the Strenuous Life offers ideal material for a detailed psycho historical analysis of aggressive manhood in the changing socio cultural environment of his era  McKinley  Taft  or Wilson would perhaps inadequately serve that purpose     He promoted competitive sports and the Boy Scouts of America   founded in 1910  as the way forward    Brands shows that heroic displays of bravery were essential to Roosevelt s image and mission   What makes the hero a hero is the romantic notion that he stands above the tawdry give and take of everyday politics  occupying an ethereal realm where partisanship gives way to patriotism  and division to unity  and where the nation regains its lost innocence  and the people their shared sense of purpose     Roosevelt was included with Presidents George Washington   Thomas Jefferson   and Abraham Lincoln at the Mount Rushmore Memorial   designed in 1927 with the approval of Republican President Calvin Coolidge       For his gallantry at San Juan Hill  Roosevelt s commanders recommended him for the Medal of Honor   In the late 1990s  Roosevelt s supporters again recommended the award  On January 16  2001  President Bill Clinton awarded Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor posthumously for his charge on San Juan Hill  Cuba  during the SpanishAmerican War    The United States Navy named two ships for Roosevelt  the USS Theodore Roosevelt  SSBN 600    a submarine that was in commission from 1961 to 1982  and the USS Theodore Roosevelt  CVN 71    an aircraft carrier that has been on active duty in the Atlantic Fleet since 1986  On November 18  1956  the United States Postal Service released a 6 Liberty Issue postage stamp honoring Roosevelt  A 32 stamp was issued on February 3  1998  as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series     In 2008  Columbia Law School awarded a law degree to Roosevelt  posthumously making him a member of the class of 1882    In Chicago  the city renamed 12th Street to Roosevelt Road four months after Roosevelt s death     In 1919  the Theodore Roosevelt Association  originally known as the Permanent Memorial National Committee  was founded by friends and supporters of Roosevelt  Soon renamed the Roosevelt Memorial Association  RMA   it was chartered in 1920 under Title 36 of the United States Code  In parallel with the RMA was an organization for women  The Women s Theodore Roosevelt Association  that had been founded in 1919 by an act of the New York State Assembly  Both organizations merged in 1956 under the current name  This organization preserved Roosevelt s papers in a 20 year project  preserved his photos and established four public sites  the reconstructed Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site   New York City  dedicated in 1923 and donated to the National Park Service in 1963  Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Park   Oyster Bay  Long Island  New York  dedicated in 1928 and given to the people of Oyster Bay  Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac River in Washington  D C    given to the federal government in 1932  Sagamore Hill  house    Roosevelt s Oyster Bay home  opened to the public in 1953 and was donated to the National Park Service in 1963 and is now the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site  The organization has its own web site at http   www

National Park in North Dakota   and Theodore Roosevelt Lake and Theodore Roosevelt Dam in Arizona    Roosevelt s   Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick   ideology is still quoted by politicians and columnists in different countriesnot only in English  but also in translations to various other languages     One lasting  popular legacy of Roosevelt is the stuffed toy bears teddy bears named after him following an incident on a hunting trip in Mississippi in 1902  Roosevelt famously refused to shoot a defenseless black bear   After the cartoonist Clifford K  Berryman illustrated the President with a bear  a toy maker heard the story and named the teddy bear after Roosevelt  Bears  and later bear cubs  became closely associated with Roosevelt in political cartoons  despite Roosevelt openly despising being called  Teddy     On June 26  2006  Roosevelt was on the cover of TIME magazine with the lead story   The Making of AmericaTheodore RooseveltThe 20th Century Express    At home and abroad  Theodore Roosevelt was the locomotive President  the man who drew his flourishing nation into the future      In 1905  Roosevelt  an admirer of various western figures  named Captain Bill McDonald of the Texas Rangers as his bodyguard and entertained the legendary Texan at the White House   Ironically  in the 1912 campaign  McDonald was Woodrow Wilson s bodyguard  Wilson thereafter named the Democrat McDonald as the U S  Marshal for the Northern district of Texas     Roosevelt has been portrayed many times in film and on television   Karl Swenson played him in the 1967 western picture Brighty of the Grand Canyon   the story of a real life burro who guided Roosevelt on a hunting trip to find mountain lions     Brian Keith played Roosevelt in the 1975 film The Wind and the Lion   He was also portrayed by actor Tom Berenger in 1997 for the TNT movie Rough Riders   a made for cable film about his exploits during the SpanishAmerican War in Cuba    Frank Albertson played Roosevelt in the episode  Rough and Ready  of the CBS series My Friend Flicka       Robin Williams portrayed Roosevelt in the form of a wax mannequin that comes to life in Night at the Museum and its

until Taylor s death in 1850  at the height of the  Crisis of 1850  over slavery    As an anti slavery moderate  he opposed abolitionist demands to exclude slavery from all the territory gained in the Mexican War   Instead he supported the Compromise of 1850   which briefly ended the crisis  In foreign policy  Fillmore supported U S  Navy expeditions to open trade in Japan   opposed French designs on Hawaii  and was embarrassed by Narciso Lpez s filibuster expeditions to Cuba   He sought election to a full term in 1852  but was passed over for the nomination by the Whigs   When the Whig Party broke up in 18541856  Fillmore and other conservative Whigs joined the American Party  the political arm of the anti immigrant  anti Catholic   Know Nothing   movement  though he himself was not anti Catholic  He was the American Party candidate for President in 1856  but finished third  During the American Civil War   Fillmore denounced secession and agreed that the Union must be maintained by force if necessary  but was very critical of the war policies of President Abraham Lincoln   After the war  he supported the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson   Although some have praised Fillmore s restrained foreign policy  he is criticized for having further aggravated tensions between abolitionists and slaveholders  he is placed near the bottom 10 of historical rankings of Presidents of the United States by various scholarly surveys   Fillmore founded the University at Buffalo and was the university s first chancellor    He also helped found the Buffalo Historical Society and the Buffalo General Hospital      Fillmore was born in a log cabin   in Moravia   Cayuga County   in the Finger Lakes region of New York State   on January 7  1800  His parents were

University of Buffalo  which today is the public University at Buffalo   the largest school in the New York state university system   In 1828  Fillmore was elected to the New York State Assembly on the Anti Masonic ticket  serving three one year terms  from 1829 to 1831  In his final term he chaired a special legislative committee to enact a new bankruptcy law that eliminated debtors  prison  As the measure had support among some Democrats  he maneuvered the law into place by taking a nonpartisan approach and allowing the Democrats to take credit for the bill  This kind of inconspicuousness and avoiding the limelight would later characterize Fillmore s approach to politics on the national stage   He was a follower and associate of Thurlow Weed   who had been a leading Anti Mason  When Weed left the Anti Masons in 1832  Fillmore did too  when Weed became the leading Whig organizer in New York  Fillmore also joined the Whigs  In 1832  he was elected U S  Representative from New York s 32nd congressional district a  National Republican   serving in the 23rd Congress from 1833 to 1835  He was succeeded in 1834 by  Anti Jacksonian  Thomas C  Love  Love declined renomination in 1836  and Fillmore was elected as a Whig  having followed his mentor Thurlow Weed into the party   He was re elected twice  serving from 1837 to 1843  in the 25th   26th   and 27th Congresses   He declined re nomination in 1842   In Congress  he opposed admitting Texas as a slave territory   he advocated internal improvements and a protective tariff   he supported John Quincy Adams by voting to receive anti slavery petitions  he advocated the prohibition by Congress of the slave trade between the states  and he favored the exclusion of slavery from the District of Columbia       He came in second place in the vote for Speaker of the House in 1841  He served as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1841 to 1843 and was an author of the Tariff of 1842   as well as two other bills that President John Tyler vetoed   After leaving Congress  Fillmore was the unsuccessful Whig Party candidate for Governor of New York in the 1844 election   He was the first New York State Comptroller elected by general ballot  defeating Orville Hungerford 174 756 to 136 027 votes    and was in office from 1848 to 1849  As Comptroller  he revised New York s banking system  making it a model for the future National Banking System   The 1848 Whig National Convention nominated General Zachary Taylor  a slaveholder from Louisiana   for President  This upset supporters of Henry Clay and   Conscience Whigs   opposed to slavery in territories gained in the MexicanAmerican War   A group of Whig pragmatists sought to balance the ticket  and the convention nominated Fillmore for Vice President  Fillmore came from a free state  had moderate anti slavery views  and could help carry the populous state of New York   Fillmore was also selected in part to prevent the nomination of the anti slavery William H  Seward   and prevent Seward from receiving a position in Taylor s cabinet   In an era where the President  Vice President and cabinet were expected to reflect geographic balance  Fillmore would  represent  New York  meaning another New Yorker  Seward  could not be in the cabinet          The Taylor Fillmore ticket won  taking 1 361 393 votes  47 3   and 163 electoral votes  16 states carried   Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler   the Democrats  took 1 223 460 votes  42 5   and 127 electoral votes  15 states carried   The third party Free Soil candidates Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams  Sr  took only 291 501 votes  10 1   and 0 electoral votes   Soon the nation was roiled by the  Crisis of 1850   Pro slavery Southerners demanded that all the new territories should be open to slavery  Anti slavery Northerners demanded complete exclusion  The recently admitted state of Texas claimed a large part of New Mexico   and wanted the U S  to assume the  national debt  of the former Republic of Texas   California settlers were petitioning for immediate admission as a free state  with no territorial stage  There were also disputes about slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia   about the apprehension of slaves who escaped to the free states  and about the territorial status of Utah   newly settled by the Mormons    Fillmore presided over the Senate during the months of nerve wracking debates over these issues  During one debate  enraged Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri stalked toward Senator Henry S  Foote of Mississippi   who brandished a pistol at Benton     Taylor stunned his fellow Southerners by urging the immediate admission of California and New Mexico as free states  Ironically  it was Fillmore  the Northerner  who supported slavery in at least part of the territory to avoid an open break with the South  He wrote   God knows that I detest slavery  but it is an existing evil     and we must endure it and give it such protection as is guaranteed by the Constitution    Clay constructed a compromise bill which included provisions desired by both sides  Fillmore did not comment publicly on the merits of the compromise proposals  A few days before President Taylor s death  Fillmore suggested to the President that if the vote on Clay s bill was tied  he as President of the Senate would cast his tie breaking vote in favor     Taylor died suddenly on July 9  1850  and Fillmore became President  The change in leadership also signaled an abrupt political shift  Taylor  it was thought  would have vetoed the Compromise bill  though some historians now doubt this   When Fillmore took office  the entire cabinet offered their resignations  Fillmore accepted them all and appointed men who  except for Treasury Secretary Thomas Corwin   favored the Compromise of 1850    When the compromise finally came before both Houses of Congress  it was very watered down  As a result  Fillmore urged Congress to pass the original bill  This move only provoked an enormous battle where  forces for and against slavery fought over every word of the bill     To Fillmore s disappointment the bitter battle over the bill crushed public support    Clay  exhausted  left Washington to recuperate  passing leadership to Senator Stephen A  Douglas of Illinois  At this critical juncture  President Fillmore announced his support of the Compromise of 1850     On August 6  1850  he sent a message to Congress recommending that Texas s debts be paid provided Texas abandoned its claims in New Mexico  This  and his deployment of 750 Federal troops to New Mexico  helped shift a critical number of northern Whigs in Congress away from their insistence upon the Wilmot Proviso   the stipulation that all the Mexican lands must be closed to slavery  Douglas modified Clay s bill accordingly  and then split it into five separate Senate bills  These bills were  admission of California as a free state  which happened on September 9  1850   settlement of the Texas boundary and debts  creation of New Mexico Territory   which would be open to slavery  the Fugitive Slave Act   and abolition of the slave trade  but not slavery   in the District of Columbia    Each measure obtained a majority  and  by September 20  President Fillmore had signed them into law  Daniel Webster wrote   I can now sleep of nights   Only a few extremists on both sides denounced the Compromise  A slave state convention called to discuss secession drew only a few delegates  Northerners were happy with the admission of California  Nonetheless  the Compromise disrupted the Whig party  which did badly in the fall 1850 elections in the north  Northern Whigs were heard to say  God save us from Whig Vice Presidents    Fillmore s greatest difficulty was the Fugitive Slave Law  southerners complained bitterly about any slackness  but enforcement was highly offensive to northerners  Fillmore s solution was to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law  but also enforce the Neutrality Act of 1818 against filibustering Southerners who were trying to make Cuba a slave state    Fillmore appointed Brigham Young as the first governor of the Utah Territory in 1850    In gratitude for creating the Utah Territory in 1850 and appointing Young as governor  Young named the territorial capital   Fillmore   and the surrounding county   Millard       Fillmore appointed Benjamin Robbins Curtis to seat two of the Supreme Court of the United States   Curtis served from September 22  1851    to September 30  1857   He attempted four times to fill the vacancy caused by Justice John McKinley  s death  The Senate took no action on the nomination of New Orleans attorney Edward A  Bradford   George Edmund Badger withdrew his nomination  Senator Judah P  Benjamin declined to serve  The nomination of William C  Micou   another New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin  was not acted on by the Senate  The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore s term  when President Pierce nominated John Archibald Campbell   who was confirmed by the Senate     Fillmore also appointed four other federal judges  all to United States district courts   John Glenn was appointed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and served from March 19  1852 to July 8  1853   Nathan K  Hall was appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and served from August 31  1852 to March 3  1874   Ogden Hoffman  Jr  was appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and the United States District Court for the Southern District of California   He began serving on February 27  1851  Hoffman was reassigned several times  beginning on January 18  1854  as the California federal courts were redistricted  He served until July 23  1866     James McHall Jones was appointed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and served from December 26  1850 to December 15  1851   In foreign affairs  Fillmore was particularly active in the Asia and the Pacific  especially with regard to Japan  which at this time still prohibited nearly all foreign contact  American merchants and shipowners wanted Japan  opened up  for trade  and so that American ships could call there for food and water on voyages to Asia  and could put in there in emergencies without being punished  They were also concerned that American sailors cast away on the Japanese coast were imprisoned as criminals     American merchants saw in the British opening of China to trade an example of the  benefits of new trade markets     Fillmore and Secretary of State Daniel Webster dispatched Commodore Matthew C  Perry to open Japan to relations with the outside world    Though Perry did not reach Japan until after the end of Fillmore s term  Fillmore ordered the Perry Expedition   and its success is to his credit     Fillmore was also a staunch opponent of European meddling in Hawaii  France under Napoleon III attempted to annex Hawaii  but backed down after Fillmore issued strongly worded message suggesting that  the United States would not stand for any such action      Though President Taylor had signed the ClaytonBulwer Treaty preventing Britain and the U S  from acquiring new possessions in the Americas  Great Britain and the United States were still attempting to gain ground in the region    The situation became tense enough that Fillmore ordered several warships to guard American merchants in an attempt to prevent British interference     Fillmore had difficulties regarding Cuba   Many southerners wanted to expand slave territory in the U S   but the Missouri Compromise and other laws prevented that  Cuba was a colony of Spain where slavery was practiced  Therefore  some of these southerners tried to get Cuba annexed to the U S  as a slave state    Venezuelan adventurer Narciso Lpez recruited Americans for three  filibustering  expeditions to Cuba  in the hope of overthrowing Spanish rule there  His first attempt in 1849 was suppressed by U S  officials by orders of President Taylor  Lpez tried again a year later  he reached Cuba but was chased away by Spanish troops and disbanded his force in Key West   Lpez and several of his followers were indicted for breach of the Neutrality Act  but were quickly acquitted by friendly Southern juries     Many southerners felt Fillmore should have supported the invasion  while some northern Democrats were upset at his apology to Spain  France and Britain dispatched warships to the region in response  Fillmore sent a stern warning saying that under certain conditions control of Cuba  might be almost essential to our  America s  safety     Lpez tried a third time in 1851  This time most of his force was captured by the Spanish  He and many of his American followers were executed  provoking outrage among American sympathizers and causing further embarrassment for Fillmore   Another issue that came up during Fillmore s presidency was the arrival of Lajos Kossuth   the exiled leader of a failed Hungarian revolution  Kossuth wanted the U S  to recognize Hungary s independence  Many Americans were sympathetic to the Hungarian rebels  especially recent German immigrants  who were now coming to the U S  in large numbers and had become a major political force  This would require the U S  to abandon its policy of nonintervention in European affairs  Fillmore ultimately refused to change American policy  and remained neutral   As the election of 1852 approached  Fillmore had been long undecided whether to run for a full term as President  In early 1852  he decided he would  The Whigs held their National Convention in June that year  Fillmore was then unpopular with northern Whigs for signing and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act  He led narrowly on the early ballots  but was short of a majority and could gain no votes  On the 52nd ballot  Daniel Webster s delegates switched to General Winfield Scott   winning him the nomination on the 53rd ballot         Democrat Franklin Pierce defeated Scott in the November election  Fillmore completed his term and was succeeded by Pierce in March 1853     When Fillmore returned to the U S   the Whig Party had broken up over slavery issues and especially the KansasNebraska Act of 1854  Most former northern Whigs  including Fillmore s old mentor Weed  joined the new Republican Party   Fillmore instead followed conservative and southern Whigs by joining the American Party  the political organ of the anti immigrant  anti Catholic Know Nothing movement  Fillmore was not himself anti Catholic  his daughter Mary had attended a girls  Catholic boarding school for a year   and he contributed to the construction of St  Joseph Cathedral in Buffalo    but at this time  the American Party was the only alternative for non Democrats who were not militantly anti slavery   Historian Allan Nevins says Fillmore was not a Know Nothing or a nativist  He was out of the country when the nomination came and had not been consulted about running  Furthermore   By no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to American tenets     However he sought national unity and said the American Party was the  only hope of forming a truly national party  which shall ignore this constant and distracting agitation of slavery      The American Party chose Fillmore as its presidential nominee for the election of 1856   He thus sought a nonconsecutive second term as president  a feat accomplished only once  by Grover Cleveland    His running mate was Andrew Jackson Donelson   nephew of former president Andrew Jackson   James Buchanan and John C  Breckinridge were the Democrat candidates  and won 1 836 072 votes  45 3   and 174 electoral votes  19 states carried   John C  Fremont and William L  Dayton were the Republican candidates and won 1 342 345 votes  33 1   and 114 electoral votes  11 states carried   Fillmore and Donelson finished third  winning 873 053 votes  21 6   and carrying the state of Maryland and its 8 electoral votes  This was one of the best showings ever by a third party presidential candidate   Fillmore s wife Abigail  who had been unwell for years  died March 30  1853  less than one month after he left office   Fillmore was one of the founders of the University at Buffalo   The school was chartered by an act of the New York State Legislature on May 11  1846  and at first was only a medical school    Fillmore was the first Chancellor   a position he held as Vice President and as President  After leaving office  Fillmore returned to Buffalo and continued to serve as chancellor of the school   On July 26  1854  Fillmore s daughter Mary died suddenly of cholera       Now left alone  Fillmore went abroad  While touring Europe in 1855  Fillmore was offered an honorary Doctor of Civil Law  D C L   degree by the University of Oxford  Fillmore turned down the honor  explaining that he had neither the  literary nor scientific attainment  to justify the degree    He is also quoted as having explained that he  lacked the benefit of a classical education  and could not  therefore  understand the Latin text of the diploma  adding that he believed  no man should accept a degree he cannot read      On February 10  1858  Fillmore married Caroline McIntosh   a wealthy widow  Their combined wealth allowed them to purchase a big house in Buffalo  New York  They were noted for lavish hospitality in their home  until Mrs  Fillmore s health began to decline in the 1860s   Fillmore helped found the Buffalo Historical Society  now the Buffalo History Museum   in 1862 and served as its first president   In the election of 1860  Fillmore supported Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell   He denounced secession  and supported the Union war effort  but also became a constant critic of the war policies of President Abraham Lincoln   such as the Emancipation Proclamation    He commanded the Union Continentals  a corps of home guards of males over the age of 45 from the upstate New York area  The Continentals trained to defend the Buffalo area in the event of a Confederate attack  as happened in the St  Albans Raid   and was planned for Johnson s Island   They performed military drill and ceremonial functions at parades  funerals  and other events  The Union Continentals guarded Lincoln s funeral train in Buffalo  They continued operations after the war  and Fillmore remained active with them almost until his death     In the 1864 election Fillmore supported Democratic candidate George B  McClellan for the presidency  believing that the Democratic Party s plan for immediate cessation of fighting and allowing the seceded states to return with slavery intact was the best possibility for restoring the Union     Fillmore also maintained a correspondence with Franklin Pierce   in which they agreed with each other that Lincoln had overstepped his authority and encouraged each other to find ways to thwart Lincoln s war policy       Fillmore s reputation as a Lincoln critic caused a crowd to gather outside his house after Lincoln s assassination  Spattering his house with ink  they demanded to know why Fillmore hadn t draped his house in black bunting as a sign of mourning for Lincoln  Fillmore asked for understanding  explaining that he was at the bedside of his ill wife  and did not know of Lincoln s death  His explanation satisfied the crowd  which soon departed     After the war  Fillmore maintained his conservative position  He supported President Andrew Johnson  s conservative Reconstruction policies  and opposed the policies of the Radical Republicans     He died at 11 10pm on March 8  1874  of the aftereffects of a stroke    His last words were alleged to be  upon being fed some soup   the nourishment is palatable   On January 7 each year  a ceremony is held at his grave site in the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo   Some northern Whigs remained irreconcilable  refusing to forgive Fillmore for having signed the Fugitive Slave Act  They helped deprive him of the Presidential nomination in 1852  Within a few years it was apparent that although the Compromise had been intended to settle the slavery controversy  it served rather as an uneasy sectional truce  Robert J  Rayback argues that the appearance of a truce  at first  seemed very real as the country entered a period of prosperity that included the South    Although Fillmore  in retirement  continued to feel that conciliation with the South was necessary and considered that the Republican Party was at least partly responsible for the subsequent disunion  he was an outspoken critic of secession and was also critical of President James Buchanan for not immediately taking military action when South Carolina seceded     Benson Lee Grayson suggests that the Fillmore administration s ability to avoid potential problems is too often overlooked  Fillmore s constant attention to Mexico avoided a resumption of the hostilities that had only broken off in 1848 and laid the groundwork for the Gadsden Treaty during Pierce s administration    Meanwhile  the Fillmore administration resolved a serious dispute with Portugal left over from the Taylor administration    smoothed over a disagreement with Peru   and then peacefully resolved other disputes with Britain  France  and Spain over Cuba  At the height of this crisis  the Royal Navy had fired on an American ship while at the same time 160 Americans were being held captive in Spain  Fillmore and his State Department were able to resolve these crises without the United States going to war or losing face     Because the Whig party was so deeply divided  and the two leading national figures in the Whig party  Fillmore and his own Secretary of State  Daniel Webster   refused to combine to secure the nomination  Winfield Scott received it  Because both the north and the south refused to unite behind Scott  he won only four of 31 states  and lost the election to Franklin Pierce   After Scott s defeat  the Whigs  decline continued  until the party broke up over the KansasNebraska Act   and the Know Nothings appeared   In the history of the U S  Presidency  Fillmore inaugurated a new era  All previous Presidents had substantial personal fortunes  acquired either by inheritance  marriage  or  in Martin van Buren  s case  by work as an attorney  Fillmore was the first of a long line of late nineteenth century chief executives  mostly lawyers  who acquired only modest wealth during their lives  were  distinctly middle class   and who spent most of their careers in public service     A popular story claims  incorrectly  that Fillmore installed the White House s first bathtub   While Fillmore s letters and papers are owned by multiple institutions  including the Penfield Library of the State University of New York at Oswego  the largest surviving collection is in the Research Library at the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society      On February 18  2010  the United States Mint released the thirteenth coin in the Presidential  1 Coin Program   bearing Fillmore s likeness  A total of 74 480 000 coins were produced       Streets in many United States cities were also named for Fillmore   Fillmore s East Aurora house was moved off Main Street   The house is designated a National Historic Landmark    The DAR placed this plaque on the house in 1931   A memorial to

 October 20  1964  was the 31st President of the United States  19291933   He was a professional mining engineer and was raised as a Quaker   A Republican   Hoover served as head of the U S  Food Administration during World War I   and became internationally known for humanitarian relief efforts in war time Belgium     As the United States Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s under Presidents Warren G  Harding and Calvin Coolidge   he promoted partnerships between government and business under the rubric  economic modernization   In the presidential election of 1928   Hoover easily won the Republican nomination   despite having no elected office experience  Hoover is the most recent cabinet secretary to be elected President of the United States  as well as one of only two Presidents  along with William Howard Taft   elected without electoral experience or high military rank   Hoover  a globally experienced engineer  believed strongly in the Efficiency Movement   which held that the government and the economy were riddled with inefficiency and waste  and could be improved by experts who could identify the problems and solve them  He also believed in the importance of volunteerism and of the role of individuals in society and the economy  Hoover  who had made a small fortune in mining  was the first of two Presidents to redistribute his salary  President Kennedy was the other  he donated all his paychecks to charity     When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 struck less than eight months after he took office  Hoover tried to combat the ensuing Great Depression with moderate government public works projects such as the Hoover Dam   The record tariffs imbedded in the Smoot Hawley Tariff and aggressive increases in the top tax bracket from 25  to 63    coupled with increases in corporate taxes     yielded a  balanced budget  in 1933  but the economy plummeted simultaneously and unemployment rates rose to afflict one in four American workers  This downward spiral set the stage for Hoover s defeat in 1932 by Democrat Franklin D  Roosevelt   who promised a New Deal   After Roosevelt assumed the Presidency in 1933  Hoover became a spokesman for opposition to the domestic and foreign policies of the New Deal  In 1947  President Harry S  Truman appointed Hoover to head the Hoover Commission   intended to foster greater efficiency throughout the federal bureaucracy  Most historians agree that Hoover s defeat in the 1932 election was caused primarily by the downward economic spiral  although his strong support for prohibition was also significant  Hoover is usually ranked lower than average among U S  Presidents     Herbert Hoover was born on August 10  1874  in West Branch   Iowa   the first of his office born in that state and west of the Mississippi River   His father  Jesse Hoover  18491880   was a blacksmith and farm implement store owner  of German  Pfautz  Wehmeyer  and Swiss  Huber  Burkhart  ancestry  Jesse Hoover and his father Eli had moved to Iowa from Ohio twenty years previously    Hoover s mother  Hulda Randall Minthorn  18491884   was born in Norwich   Ontario   Canada   and was of English and Irish ancestry  Both of his parents were Quakers    At about age two  Bertie   as he was then called  contracted the croup   He was so ill that he was momentarily thought to have died  until he was resuscitated by his uncle  John Minthorn    As a child  he was often called by his father  my little stick in the mud   since he repeatedly was trapped in the mud while crossing an unpaved street    Hoover s family figured prominently in the town s public prayer life  due almost entirely to Hulda s role in her church    His father  noted by the local paper for his  pleasant  sunshiny disposition   died in 1880  After working to retire her husband s debts  retain their life insurance  and care for the children  his mother died in 1884  leaving Hoover  age nine   his older brother  and his younger sister as orphans    Fellow Quaker Lawrie Tatum was appointed as Hoover s guardian   After a brief stay with one of his grandmothers in Kingsley  Iowa   Hoover lived the next 18 months with his uncle Allen Hoover in West Branch  In November 1885  he went to Newberg  Oregon   to live with his uncle Dr  John Minthorn  a physician and businessman whose own son had died the year before  The Minthorn household was considered cultured and educational  and imparted a strong work ethic    For two and a half years  Hoover attended Friends Pacific Academy  now George Fox University    and then worked as an office assistant in his uncle s real estate office  the Oregon Land Company  in Salem  Oregon   Though he did not attend high school  Hoover attended night school and learned bookkeeping  typing and mathematics     Hoover entered Stanford University in 1891  its inaugural year  after failing all the entrance exams  except mathematics  and then being tutored for the summer in Palo Alto    The first year students were not required to pay tuition    Hoover claimed to be the very first student at Stanford  by virtue of having been the first person in the first class to sleep in the dormitory    While at the university  he was the student manager of both the baseball and football teams and was a part of the inaugural Big Game versus rival the University of California and friend  CAL Manager  Herbert Lang    Only 10 000 tickets were printed for the inaugural game and 20 000 people showed up  Both Hoover and Lang had to find pots  bowls and any other available receptacles to collect admission fees    Stanford won the game    Hoover graduated in 1895 with a degree in geology    He earned his way through four years of college working various jobs on and off campus  including at the Arkansas and United States Geological Survey    Throughout his tenure at Stanford  he was adamantly opposed to the fraternity system     Hoover went to Western Australia in 1897 as an employee of Bewick  Moreing   Co   a London  based gold mining company  His geological training and work experience were well suited for the firm s objectives    He worked at gold mines in Big Bell   Cue   Gwalia   Menzies   and Coolgardie       Hoover first went to Coolgardie  then the center of the Western Australian goldfields  where he worked under Edward Hooper  a company partner  Conditions were harsh in these goldfields even though he got a  5 000 salary  equivalent to  100 000 today     In the Coolgardie and Murchison rangelands on the edge of the Great Victoria Desert   Hoover described the region as a land of  black flies  red dust and white heat     He served as a geologist and mining engineer while searching the Western Australian goldfields for investments  After being appointed as mine manager at the age of 23  he led a major program of expansion for the Sons of Gwalia gold mine at Gwalia  and brought in many Italian immigrants to cut costs and counter the union militancy of the Australian miners      He believed  the rivalry between the Italians and the other men was of no small benefit     He also described Italians as  fully 20 per cent superior    to other miners   During his time at Gwalia  Hoover first met Fleury James Lyster  a pioneering metallurgist       In Western Australia friends called Hoover  H C   or the old nickname  Hail Columbia     An open feud developed between Hoover and his boss Ernest Williams  with Hoover persuading four other mine managers to conspire against his rival  The firm s principals then offered Hoover a compelling promotion which would relocate him to China and also end the feud    Hoover then began to take stock of his private life  including contemplating a separation from his Stanford sweetheart  Lou Henry    Hoover promptly sent a cable of proposal to her  and subsequently married Lou Henry  in 1899  She had been an Episcopalian and became a Quaker  The Hoovers had two sons  Herbert Charles Hoover  19031969  and Allan Henry Hoover  19071993   The family subsequently went to China  Hoover worked as chief engineer for the Chinese Bureau of Mines  and as general manager for the Chinese Engineering and Mining Corporation    Later he worked for Bewick  Moreing   Co  as the company s lead engineer  Hoover and his wife learned Mandarin Chinese while he worked in China and used it during his tenure at the White House when they wanted to foil eavesdroppers    Hoover made recommendations to improve the lot of the Chinese worker  seeking to end the practice of imposing long term servitude contracts and to institute reforms for workers based on merit    The Boxer Rebellion trapped the Hoovers in Tianjin in June 1900  For almost a month  the settlement was under fire  and both dedicated themselves to defense of their city  Hoover himself guided U S  Marines around Tianjin during the battle  using his knowledge of the local terrain    Mrs  Hoover meanwhile devoted her efforts at the various hospitals and even wielded  and willingly and accurately deployed  a  38 caliber pistol     Hoover was made a partner in Bewick  Moreing   Co  on December 18  1901 and assumed responsibility for various Australian operations and investments    His initial compensation rose to  12 500 annually in addition to a 20  share of profits    The company eventually controlled at one point approximately 50  of gold production in Western Australia    In 1901  Hoover no longer lived in Australia  but he visited the country in 1902  1903  1905  and 1907 as an overseas investor   Hoover was also a director of Chinese Engineering and Mining Corporation  CEMC  when it became a supplier of immigrant labor from Southeast Asia for South African mines    The first shipment of almost 2 000 workers arrived in Durban from Qinhuangdao in July 1904  By 1906  the total number of immigrant workers increased to 50 000  almost entirely recruited and shipped by CEMC  When the living and working conditions of the laborers became known  public opposition to the scheme grew and questions were asked in the British Parliament    The scheme was abandoned in 1911   In AugustSeptember 1905  he founded the Zinc Corporation  eventually part of the Rio Tinto Group   with William Baillieu and others  The lead silver ore produced at Broken Hill  New South Wales was rich in zinc   But the zinc could not be recovered due to  the Sulphide Problem   and was left in the tailings that remained after the silver and lead was extracted     Zinc Corporation proposed to buy the tailings and extract the zinc by a new process  The froth flotation process was then being developed at Broken Hill  although the Zinc Corporation struggled to apply it    Hoover came to Broken Hill in 1907  So did Australian engineer Jim Lyster  whose  Lyster Process     enabled the Zinc Corporation to operate the world s first selective or differential flotation plant  from September 1912    Hoover s brother  Theodore J  Hoover  also came to Broken Hill    Broken Hill was one of the dreariest places in the world at this time  It lay in the middle of the desert  was unbelievably hot in summer  had no fresh water  no vegetation  and mountains of tailings blew into every crack with every wisp of wind     Despite these miserable conditions  Hoover and his associates became suppliers to world industry of zinc and other vital base minerals   In 1908  Hoover became an independent mining consultant  traveling worldwide until the outbreak of World War I in 1914  He left Bewick  Moreing   Co and  setting out on his own  eventually ended up with investments on every continent and offices in San Francisco   London   New York City   St  Petersburg   Paris and Mandalay   Burma     He had his second successful venture with the British firm Burma Corporation  again producing silver  lead  and zinc in large quantities at the Namtu Bawdwin Mine  where he caught malaria in 1907    While living in London  noting the American engineer s patriotic intensity  some British acquaintances referred to him as the  star spangled Hoover   It recalled the nickname he had acquired in the Australian outback   Hail Columbia  Hoover    The Bawdwin mine ultimately became the chief source of Hoover s fortune     In his spare time  Hoover wrote  His lectures at Columbia and Stanford universities were published in 1909 as Principles of Mining     which became a standard textbook  Hoover and his wife also published their English translation of the 1556 mining classic De re metallica in 1912  This translation from the Latin of Renaissance author Georgius Agricola is still the most important scholarly version and provides its historical context    It is still in print   By 1914  Hoover was a wealthy man  with an estimated personal fortune of  4 million    He was once quoted as saying  If a man has not made a million dollars by the time he is forty  he is not worth much     By 1914  Hoover stood eventually to obtain what he later described as  a large fortune from these Russian industries  probably more than is good for anybody     Sixty six years after opening the mine in 1897  Hoover still had a partial share in the Sons of Gwalia mine when it finally closed in 1963  just one year before the former President s death in New York City in 1964  The successful mine had yielded  55m in gold and  10m in dividends for investors    Herbert Hoover  acting as a main investor  financier  mining speculator  and organizer of men  played a major role in the important metallurgical developments that occurred in Broken Hill in the first decade of the twentieth century  developments that had a great impact on the mining and production of silver  lead  and zinc              In later years Hoover thought of himself and his associates as  engineering doctors to sick concerns   hence his reputation as the  Doctor of sick mines      After World War II   Hoover s mining work in the Kyshtym area of Russia proved invaluable to American intelligence agencies  They had been unable to find detailed maps of the area  which contained the Soviets  first military plutonium production facility at Mayak   making knowledge of the area vital in the event of war with the Soviet Union  It was determined that Hoover had given extremely detailed maps of the area to Stanford University     When World War I began in August 1914  Hoover helped organize the return of around 120 000 Americans from Europe  He led 500 volunteers in distributing food  clothing  steamship tickets and cash     I did not realize it at the moment  but on August 3  1914  my career was over forever  I was on the slippery road of public life     Hoover liked to say that the difference between dictatorship and democracy was simple  dictators organize from the top down  democracies from the bottom up   When Belgium faced a food crisis after being invaded by Germany in 1914  Hoover undertook an unprecedented relief effort with the Commission for Relief in Belgium  CRB     As chairman of the CRB  Hoover worked with the leader of the Belgian Comit National de Secours et d Alimentation  CNSA   mile Francqui   to feed the entire nation for the duration of the war  The CRB obtained and imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the CNSA to distribute  and watched over the CNSA to make sure the German army didn t appropriate the food  The CRB became a veritable independent republic of relief  with its own flag  navy  factories  mills  and railroads  Private donations and government grants  78   supplied an  11 million a month budget     For the next two years  Hoover worked 14 hour days from London  administering the distribution of over two million tons of food to nine million war victims  In an early form of shuttle diplomacy   he crossed the North Sea forty times to meet with German authorities and persuade them to allow food shipments  becoming an international hero  The Belgian city of Leuven named a prominent square Hooverplein after him  At its peak  Hoover s American Relief Administration  ARA  fed 10 5 million people daily  Great Britain grew reluctant to support the CRB  preferring instead to emphasize Germany s obligation to supply the relief  Winston Churchill   whom Hoover intensely disliked  led a military faction that considered the Belgian relief effort  a positive military disaster    During this time  Hoover made a strong impression on the American Ambassador to Great Britain  Walter Page  In a Memoranda dated December 30  1916  Page wrote  Mr  Herbert C  Hoover  Chairman of the Commission for Relief in Belgium  would  if opportunity should offer  make a useful officer in the State Department  He is probably the only man living who has privately  i e   without holding office  negotiated understandings with the British  French  German  Dutch  and Belgian governments  He personally knows and has had direct dealings with these governments  and his transactions with them have involved several hundred million dollars  He is a man of very considerable fortuneless than when the war began  for tins relief work has cost him much  He was approached on behalf of the British Government with the suggestion that if he would become a British subject the Government would be pleased to give him an important executive post and with the hint that if he succeeded a title might await him  His answer was   I ll do what I can for you with pleasure  but I ll be damned if I ll give up my American citizenshipnot on your life   Within the last six months two large financial organizations  each independently  have offered him  100 000 a year to enter their service  and an industrial company offered him  100 000  to start with   He declined them all  When the Belgian relief work recently struck a financial snag  Hoover by telegraph got the promise of a loan in the United States to the British and French governments for Belgian relief of  150 000 000  I do not know  but I think he would be glad to turn his European experience to the patriotic use of our government  He is forty two years old  a graduate of Leland Stanford Jr  University     After the United States entered the war in April 1917  President Woodrow Wilson appointed Hoover to head the U S  Food Administration   which was created under the Lever Food Control Act in 1917  This was a position he actively sought  though he later claimed it was thrust upon him  He was convinced from his Belgian work that centralization of authority was essential to any relief effort  he demanded  and got  great power albeit not as much as he sought    Hoover believed  food will win the war   and beginning on September 29  this slogan was introduced and put into frequent use     He carefully selected men to assist in the agency leadership  Alonzo Taylor  technical abilities   Robert Taft  political associations   Gifford Pinchot  agricultural influence  and Julius Barnes  business acumen     Hoover established set days for people to avoid eating specified foods and save them for soldiers  rations  meatless Mondays  wheatless Wednesdays  and  when in doubt  eat potatoes   This program helped reduce consumption of foodstuffs needed overseas and avoided rationing at home  It was dubbed  Hooverizing  by government publicists  in spite of Hoover s continual orders that publicity should not mention him by name  The agency employed a system of price controls and licensing requirements for suppliers to maximize production  Despite efforts to prevent it  some companies reaped great profits     After the war  as a member of the Supreme Economic Council and head of the American Relief Administration   Hoover organized shipments of food for millions of starving people in Central Europe   He used a newly formed Quaker organization  the American Friends Service Committee   to carry out much of the logistical work in Europe   Hoover provided aid to the defeated German nation after the war  as well as relief to famine  stricken Bolshevik  controlled areas of Russia in 1921  despite the opposition of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and other Republicans  When asked if he was not thus helping Bolshevism  Hoover retorted   Twenty million people are starving  Whatever their politics  they shall be fed    The Russian famine of 192122 claimed 6 million people    In July 1922  Soviet author Maxim Gorky wrote to Hoover   Your help will enter history as a unique  gigantic achievement  worthy of the greatest glory  which will long remain in the memory of millions of Russians whom you have saved from death     At war s end  the New York Times named Hoover one of the  Ten Most Important Living Americans   Hoover confronted a world of political possibilities when he returned home in 1919  Democratic Party leaders saw him as a potential Presidential candidate  and President Wilson privately preferred Hoover as his successor   There could not be a finer one   asserted Franklin D  Roosevelt   then a rising star from New York  Hoover briefly considered becoming a Democrat  but he believed that 1920 would be a Republican year  Also  Hoover confessed that he could not run for a party whose only member in his boyhood home had been the town drunk   Hoover realized that he was in a unique position to collect information about the Great War and its aftermath  In 1919 he established the Hoover War Collection at Stanford University  He donated all the files of the Commission for Relief in Belgium  the U S  Food Administration  and the American Relief Administration  and pledged  50 000 as an endowment  Scholars were sent to Europe to collect pamphlets  society publications  government documents  newspapers  posters  proclamations  and other ephemeral materials related to the war and the revolutions that followed it  The collection was later renamed the Hoover War Library and is now known as the Hoover Institution    Hoover rejected the Democratic Party s overtures in 1920  He had been a registered Republican before the war  though he had supported Theodore Roosevelt s  Bull Moose  Progressive Party in 1912  Now he declared himself a Republican and a candidate for the Presidency   He placed his name on the ballot in the California state primary election   where he nearly beat popular Senator Hiram Johnson   But having lost in his home state  Hoover was not considered a serious contender at the convention  Even when it deadlocked for several ballots between Illinois Governor Frank Lowden and General Leonard Wood   few delegates seriously considered Hoover as a compromise choice  Although he had personal misgivings about the capability of the nominee  Warren G  Harding   Hoover publicly endorsed him and made two speeches for Harding   After being elected  Harding rewarded Hoover for his support  offering to appoint him either Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Commerce   Hoover ultimately chose Commerce  Commerce had existed for just eight years  since the division of the earlier Department of Commerce and Labor   Commerce was considered a minor Cabinet post  with limited and vaguely defined responsibilities   Hoover aimed to change that  envisioning the Commerce Department as the hub of the nation s growth and stability  From Harding he demanded  and received  authority to coordinate economic affairs throughout the government  He created many sub departments and committees  overseeing and regulating everything from manufacturing statistics  the census and radio  to air travel  In some instances he  seized  control of responsibilities from other Cabinet departments when he deemed that they were not carrying out their responsibilities well  Hoover became one of the most visible men in the country  often overshadowing Presidents Harding and Coolidge  Washington wags referred to Hoover as  the Secretary of Commerce    and Under Secretary of Everything Else    As secretary and later as President  Hoover revolutionized relations between business and government  Rejecting the adversarial stance of Theodore Roosevelt  William Howard Taft  and Woodrow Wilson  he sought to make the Commerce Department a powerful service organization  empowered to forge cooperative voluntary partnerships between government and business  This philosophy is often called   associationalism    Both the U S  Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission opposed Hoover s goals    but the U S  Supreme Court ruled in Maple Flooring Manufacturers  Assn  v  United States 268 U S  563  1925  that Hoover s policies served the public interest by producing  fairer price levels  and  avoid ing  waste      Many of Hoover s efforts as Commerce Secretary centered on eliminating waste and increasing efficiency in business and industry  This included reducing labor losses from trade disputes and seasonal fluctuations  reducing industrial losses from accident and injury  and reducing the amount of crude oil spilled during extraction and shipping  One major achievement was to promote product standardizations  He promoted international trade by opening overseas offices to advise businessmen  Hoover was especially eager to promote Hollywood films overseas     His  Own Your Own Home  campaign was a collaboration to promote ownership of single family dwellings  with groups such as the Better Houses in America movement  the Architects  Small House Service Bureau  and the Home Modernizing Bureau  He worked with bankers and the savings and loan industry to promote the new long term home mortgage  which dramatically stimulated home construction     It has been suggested that Herbert Hoover was the best Secretary of Commerce in United States history      Hoover was the last President to have held a full cabinet position   Hoover s radio conferences played a key role in the early organization  development and regulation of radio broadcasting  Prior to the Radio Act of 1927   the Secretary of Commerce was unable to deny radio licensing or reassign broadcast frequencies  With help from supporters Senator Dill and Representative White  Hoover brought the issue of radio control to the Senate floor  Hoover fought for more power to control the proliferation of licensed radio stations  which in 1927  stood at 732 stations   With help from Dill and White  Hoover promoted the Dill White Bill which eventually would become the Radio Act of 1927  This act allowed the government to intervene and abolish radio stations that were deemed  non useful  to the public  Hoover s attempts at regulating radio were not supported by all Congressmen  and he received much opposition from the Senate and from radio station owners  However  Hoover s contributions to regulate radio in its infancy heavily influenced the modern radio system     Hoover contributed to major projects for navigation  irrigation of dry lands  electrical power  and flood control  As the new air transport industry developed  Hoover held a conference on aviation to promote codes and regulations  He became President of the American Child Health Organization  and he raised private funds to promote health education in schools and communities   Although he continued to consider Harding ill suited to be President  the two men nevertheless became friends  Hoover accompanied Harding on his final trip out West in 1923  It was Hoover who called for a specialist to tend to the ailing Chief Executive  and it was also Hoover who contacted the White House to inform them of the President s death  The Commerce Secretary headed the group of dignitaries accompanying Harding s body back to the capital   By the end of Hoover s service as Secretary  he had raised the status of the Department of Commerce  This was reflected in its modern headquarters built during the Roosevelt Administration in the 1930s in the Federal Triangle in Washington  D C   As Commerce Secretary  Hoover also hosted two national conferences on street traffic  in 1924 and 1926  a third convened in 1930  during Hoover s presidency   Collectively the meetings were called the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety  Hoover s chief objective was to address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents  but the scope grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards  rules of the road  and urban traffic control  He left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves  which were then presented for adoption by states and localities  Because automotive trade associations were the best organized  many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests  The conferences issued a model Uniform Vehicle Code for adoption by the states  and a Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance for adoption by cities  Both were widely influential  promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile s priority in city streets     The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 broke the banks and levees of the lower Mississippi River in early 1927  resulting in flooding of millions of acres and leaving 1 5 million people displaced from their homes  Although such a disaster did not fall under the duties of the Commerce Department  the governors of six states along the Mississippi specifically asked for Herbert Hoover in the emergency  President Calvin Coolidge sent Hoover to mobilize state and local authorities  militia  army engineers  the Coast Guard  and the American Red Cross    With a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation   Hoover set up health units to work in the flooded regions for a year  These workers stamped out malaria   pellagra   and typhoid fever from many areas  His work during the flood brought Herbert Hoover to the front page of newspapers almost everywhere  and he gained new accolades as a humanitarian  The great victory of his relief work  he stressed  was not that the government rushed in and provided all assistance  it was that much of the assistance available was provided by private citizens and organizations in response to his appeals   I suppose I could have called in the Army to help   he said   but why should I  when I only had to call upon Main Street    The treatment of African Americans during the disaster endangered Hoover s reputation as a humanitarian  Local officials brutalized black farmers and prevented them from leaving relief camps  aid intended for African American sharecroppers was often given instead to the landowners  and black men often were conscripted by locals into forced labor  sometimes at gun point    Knowing the potential damage to his presidential hopes if this became public  Hoover struck a deal with Robert Russa Moton     the prominent African American successor to Booker T  Washington as president of the Tuskegee Institute   In exchange for keeping the sufferings of African Americans quiet  Hoover promised unprecedented influence for African Americans should he become president  Moton agreed  and following the accommodationist philosophy of Washington  he worked actively   to conceal the information from the media   When President Calvin Coolidge announced in August 1927 that he would not seek a second full term of office in the 1928 presidential election   Hoover became the leading Republican candidate  despite the fact Coolidge was lukewarm on Hoover  often deriding his ambitious and popular Commerce Secretary as  Wonder Boy     Coolidge had been reluctant to choose Hoover as his successor  on one occasion he remarked that  for six years that man has given me unsolicited adviceall of it bad  I was particularly offended by his comment to  shit or get off the pot      Even so  Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the popular Commerce Secretary s nomination     Hoover s only real challenger was Frank Orren Lowden   a former governor of Illinois  Hoover received much favorable press coverage in the months leading up to the convention  Lowden s campaign manager complained that newspapers were full of  nothing but advertisements for Herbert Hoover and Fletcher s Castoria    Hoover s reputation  experience  and popularity coalesced to give him the Republican nomination on the first ballot   The delegates considered nominating Vice President Charles Dawes to be Hoover s running mate   But Coolidge  who hated Dawes  remarked that this would be  a personal affront  to him  The convention selected Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas     Hoover campaigned for efficiency and the Republican record of prosperity against Democrat Alfred E  Smith   Smith likewise was a proponent of efficiency earned as governor of New York  Both candidates were pro business  and each promised to improve conditions for farmers  reform immigration laws  and maintain America s isolationist foreign policy  Where they differed was on the Volstead Act which outlawed the sale of liquor and beer  Smith was a  wet  who called for its repeal  whereas Hoover gave limited support for prohibition  calling it an  experiment noble in purpose   His use of  experiment  suggested it was not permanent  While Smith won extra support among Catholics in the big cities Smith was the target of intense anti Catholicism from some Protestant communities  especially as Southern Baptists and German Lutherans    Overall the religious factor worked to the advantage of Hoover  although he took no part in it     Historians agree that Hoover s national reputation and the booming economy  combined with deep splits in the Democratic Party over religion and prohibition  guaranteed his landslide victory with 58  of the vote    Hoover s appeal to southern white voters succeeded in cracking the   Solid South    winning the Democratic strongholds of Florida  North Carolina  Virginia  Texas and Tennessee  the Deep South continued to support Smith as the Democratic candidate  This was the first time that a Republican candidate for president had carried Texas  This outraged the black leadership  which largely broke from the Republican Party  and began seeking candidates who supported civil rights within the Democratic Party     Hoover held a press conference on his first day in office  promising a  new phase of press relations     He asked the group of journalists to elect a committee to recommend improvements to the White House press conference  Hoover declined to use a spokesman  instead asking reporters to directly quote him and giving them handouts with his statements ahead of time  In his first 120 days in office  he held more regular and frequent press conferences than any other President  before or since  However  he changed his press policies after the 1929 stock market crash  screening reporters and greatly reducing his availability     Lou Henry Hoover was an activist First Lady  She typified the new woman of the postWorld War I era  intelligent  robust  and aware of multiple female possibilities     White House physician Admiral Joel T  Boone invented the sport Hooverball to keep Hoover fit while in the White House  Hooverball is a combination of volleyball and tennis   played with a 6 lb medicine ball  Hoover and several staff members played it each morning  earning them the nickname Medicine Ball Cabinet      On poverty  Hoover said that  Given the chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years  we shall soon with the help of God  be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation     and promised   We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land   but within months  the Stock Market Crash of 1929 occurred  and the world s economy spiraled downward into the Great Depression      Hoover entered office with a plan to reform the nation s regulatory system  believing that a federal bureaucracy should have limited regulation over a country s economic system    A self described progressive and reformer   Hoover saw the presidency as a vehicle for improving the conditions of all Americans by encouraging public private cooperationwhat he termed  volunteerism   Hoover saw volunteerism as preferable to governmental coercion or intervention which he saw as opposed to the American ideals of individualism and self reliance    Long before he had entered politics  he had denounced laissez faire thinking     Hoover expanded civil service coverage of Federal positions  canceled private oil leases on government lands  and by instructing the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service to pursue gangsters for tax evasion  he enabled the prosecution of mobster Al Capone   He appointed a commission that set aside 3 000 000 acres  12 000km  of national parks and 2 300 000 acres of national forests  advocated tax reduction for low income Americans  not enacted   closed certain tax loopholes for the wealthy  doubled the number of veterans  hospital facilities  negotiated a treaty on St  Lawrence Seaway  which failed in the U S  Senate    wrote a Children s Charter that advocated protection of every child regardless of race or gender  created an antitrust division in the Justice Department   required air mail carriers to adopt stricter safety measures and improve service  proposed federal loans for urban slum clearances  not enacted   organized the Federal Bureau of Prisons   reorganized the Bureau of Indian Affairs   instituted prison reform  proposed a federal Department of Education  not enacted   advocated  50 per month pensions for Americans over 65  not enacted   chaired White House conferences on child health  protection  homebuilding and home ownership  began construction of the Boulder Dam  later renamed Hoover Dam   and signed the NorrisLa Guardia Act that limited judicial intervention in labor disputes    citation needed    On November 19  1928  Hoover embarked on a seven week goodwill tour of several Latin American nations to outline his economic and trade policies to other nations in the Western Hemisphere    Following the release in 1930 of the Clark Memorandum   Hoover began formulating what would become Roosevelt s Good Neighbor policy   He began withdrawing American troops from Nicaragua and Haiti  he also proposed an arms embargo on Latin America and a one third reduction of the world s naval power  which was called the Hoover Plan  The Roosevelt Corollary ceased being part of U S  foreign policy  In response to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria   he and Secretary of State Henry Stimson outlined the HooverStimson Doctrine which held that the United States would not recognize territories gained by force     Hoover mediated between Chile and Peru to solve a conflict on the sovereignty of Arica and Tacna   that in 1883 by the Treaty of Ancn had been awarded to Chile for ten years  to be followed by a plebiscite that had never happened  By the TacnaArica compromise at the Treaty of Lima in 1929  Chile kept Arica  and Peru regained Tacna   Hoover seldom mentioned civil rights while he was President  He believed that African Americans and other races could improve themselves with education and wanted the races assimilated into white culture     Hoover attempted to appoint John J  Parker of North Carolina to the Supreme Court in 1930 to replace Edward Sanford   The NAACP claimed that Parker had made many court decisions against African Americans  and they fought the nomination  The NAACP was successful in gaining Senator William Borah  s support and the nomination was defeated by two votes  39 41  in the Senate     First Lady Lou Hoover defied custom and invited the wife of Republican Oscar DePriest   the only African American member in Congress  to tea at the White House   Booker T  Washington was the previous African American to have dined at the White House  with Theodore Roosevelt in 1901     Charles Curtis   the nation s first Native American Vice President  was from the Kaw tribe in Kansas    Hoover s humanitarian and Quaker reputation  along with Curtis as a vice president  gave special meaning to his Indian policies  His Quaker upbringing influenced his views that Native Americans needed to achieve economic self sufficiency  As President  he appointed Charles J  Rhoads as commissioner of Indian affairs  Hoover supported Rhoads  commitment to Indian assimilation and sought to minimize the federal role in Indian affairs  His goal was to have Indians acting as individuals  not as tribes  and to assume the responsibilities of citizenship granted with the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924      Hoover had long been a proponent of the concept that public private cooperation was the way to achieve high long term growth    Hoover feared that too much government intervention would undermine long term individuality and self reliance  which he considered essential to the nation s future  Both his ideals and the economy were put to the test with the onset of the Great Depression     Although many people at the time and for decades afterwards denounced Hoover for taking a hands off    laissez faire    approach to the Depression    a few historians emphasize how active he actually was  Hoover said he rejected Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon  s suggested  leave it alone  approach    and called many business leaders to Washington to urge them not to lay off workers or cut wages     Libertarian economist Murray Rothbard argues that Hoover was actually the initiator of what came to be the New Deal   Hoover engaged in many unprecedented public works programs  including an increase in the Federal Buildings program of over  400 million and the establishment of the Division of Public Construction to spur public works planning  Hoover himself granted more subsidies to ship construction through the Federal Shipping Board and asked for a further  175 million appropriation for public works  this was followed in July 1930 with the expenditure of a giant  915 million public works program  including a Hoover Dam on the Colorado River      In the spring of 1930  Hoover acquired from Congress an added  100 million to continue the Federal Farm Board lending and purchasing policies  At the end of 1929  the FFB established a national wool cooperative the National Wool Marketing Corporation  NWMC  made up of 30 state associations  The Board also established an allied National Wool Credit Corporation to handle finances  A total of  31 5 million in loans for wool were made by the FFB  of which  12 5 million were permanently lost  these massive agricultural subsidies were a precedent for the later Agricultural Adjustment Act       Hoover also advocated strong labor regulation law  including the enactment of the Bacon Davis Act  requiring a maximum eight hour day on construction of public buildings and the payment of at least the  prevailing wage  in the locality  as well as the Norris LaGuardia Act in 1932  In the Banking sector  Hoover passed The Federal Home Loan Bank Act in July  1932  establishing 12 district banks ruled by a Federal Home Loan Bank Board in a manner similar to the Federal Reserve System   125 million capital was subscribed by the Treasury and this was subsequently shifted to the RFC  Hoover was also instrumental in passing the Glass Steagall Act of 1932  allowing for prime rediscounting at the Federal Reserve  allowing further inflation of credit and bank reserves     Lee Ohanian   from UCLA  argues that Hoover adopted pro labor policies after the 1929 stock market crash that  accounted for close to two thirds of the drop in the nation s gross domestic product over the two years that followed  causing what might otherwise have been a bad recession to slip into the Great Depression     This argument is at odds with the more Keynesian view of the causes of the Depression  and has been challenged as revisionist by J  Bradford DeLong of U C  Berkeley     Calls for greater government assistance increased as the U S  economy continued to decline  He was also a firm believer in balanced budgets  as were most Democrats   and was unwilling to run a budget deficit to fund welfare programs    However  Hoover did pursue many policies in an attempt to pull the country out of depression  In 1929 he authorized the Mexican Repatriation program to help unemployed Mexican citizens return home  The program was largely a forced migration of approximately 500 000 people to Mexico  and continued until 1937  In June 1930  over the objection of many economists  Congress approved and Hoover reluctantly signed into law the SmootHawley Tariff Act   The legislation raised tariffs on thousands of imported items  The intent of the Act was to encourage the purchase of American made products by increasing the cost of imported goods  while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers  However  economic depression had spread worldwide  and Canada  France and other nations retaliated by raising tariffs on imports from the U S  The result was to contract international trade  and worsen the Depression     In 1931  Hoover issued the Hoover Moratorium   calling for a one year halt in reparation payments by Germany to France and in the payment of Allied war debts to the United States  The plan was met with much opposition  especially from France  who saw significant losses to Germany during World War I  The Moratorium did little to ease economic declines  As the moratorium neared its expiration the following year  an attempt to find a permanent solution was made at the Lausanne Conference of 1932   A working compromise was never established  and by the start of World War II  reparations payments had stopped completely      Hoover in 1931 urged the major banks in the country to form a consortium known as the National Credit Corporation  NCC      In the U S  by 1932 unemployment had reached 24 9     businesses defaulted on record numbers of loans  and more than 5 000 banks had failed    Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless and began congregating in the numerous Hoovervilles  shanty towns  that sprang up in major cities   Congress  desperate to increase federal revenue  enacted the Revenue Act of 1932   which was the largest peacetime tax increase in history    The Act increased taxes across the board  so that top earners were taxed at 63  on their net income  The 1932 Act also increased the tax on the net income of corporations from 12  to 13 75    The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to rescue the economy occurred in 1932 with the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act   which authorized funds for public works programs and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation  RFC   The RFC s initial goal was to provide government secured loans to financial institutions  railroads and farmers  The RFC had minimal impact at the time  but was adopted by President Franklin D  Roosevelt and greatly expanded as part of his New Deal   To pay for these and other government programs and to make up for revenue lost due to the Depression  in addition to the Revenue Act of 1932 Hoover agreed to roll back several tax cuts that his Administration had enacted on upper incomes  The estate tax was doubled and corporate taxes were raised by almost 15   Also  a  check tax  was included that placed a 2 cent tax  over 30 cents in today s economy  on all bank checks  Economists William D  Lastrapes and George Selgin    conclude that the check tax was  an important contributing factor to that period s severe monetary contraction   Hoover also encouraged Congress to investigate the New York Stock Exchange   and this pressure resulted in various reforms   Thousands of World War I veterans and their families demonstrated and camped out in Washington  DC  during June 1932  calling for immediate payment of a bonus that had been promised by the World War Adjusted Compensation Act in 1924 for payment in 1945  Although offered money by Congress to return home  some members of the   Bonus army   remained  Washington police attempted to remove the demonstrators from their camp  but they were outnumbered and unsuccessful  Shots were fired by the police in a futile attempt to attain order  and two protesters were killed while many officers were injured  Hoover sent U S  Army forces led by General Douglas MacArthur and helped by lower ranking officers Dwight D  Eisenhower and George S  Patton to stop a march  MacArthur  believing he was fighting a communist revolution  chose to clear out the camp with military force  In the ensuing clash  hundreds of civilians were injured  Hoover had sent orders that the Army was not to move on the encampment  but MacArthur chose to ignore the command  Hoover was incensed  but refused to reprimand MacArthur  The entire incident was another devastating negative for Hoover in the 1932 election  That led New York governor and Democratic presidential candidate Franklin Roosevelt to declare of Hoover   There is nothing inside the man but jelly    Hoover appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States      Hoover broke party lines to appoint the Democrat Cardozo  He explained that he  was one of the ancient believers that the Supreme Court should have a strong minority of the opposition s party and that all appointments should be made from experienced jurists  When the vacancy came     Hoover  canvassed all the possible Democratic jurists and immediately concluded that Justice Cardozo was the right man and appointed him      Although Hoover had come to detest the presidency  he agreed to run again in 1932  not only as a matter of pride  but also because he feared that no other likely Republican candidate would deal with the depression without resorting to what Hoover considered dangerously radical measures   Hoover was nominated by the Republicans for a second term  He had originally planned to make only one or two major speeches  and to leave the rest of the campaigning to proxies  but when polls showed the entire Republican ticket facing a resounding defeat at the polls  Hoover agreed to an expanded schedule of public addresses  In his nine major radio addresses Hoover primarily defended his administration and his philosophy  The apologetic approach did not allow Hoover to refute Democratic nominee Franklin Roosevelt s charge that he was personally responsible for the depression     In his campaign trips around the country  Hoover was faced with perhaps the most hostile crowds of any sitting president  Besides having his train and motorcades pelted with eggs and rotten fruit  he was often heckled while speaking  and on several occasions  the Secret Service halted attempts to kill Hoover by disgruntled citizens  including capturing one man nearing Hoover carrying sticks of dynamite  and another already having removed several spikes from the rails in front of the President s train     Franklin D  Roosevelt blasted Hoover for spending and taxing too much  increasing national debt  raising tariffs and blocking trade  as well as placing millions on the government dole  Roosevelt attacked Hoover for  reckless and extravagant  spending  of thinking  that we ought to center control of everything in Washington as rapidly as possible     Roosevelt s running mate  John Nance Garner   accused the Republican of  leading the country down the path of socialism      Osro Cobb   a leader of the Republican Party in Arkansas who became politically and personally close to Hoover  recalls   President Hoover had become convinced that the Democrats deliberately were destroying the economy of the country and erecting roadblocks against every measure he offered to the Congress to restore balance to the economy     all for the purpose of winning an election  Just a few weeks before the 1932 election  we were standing near a window in the Oval Office  His cigar was frayed and out  and he was in deep thought and obviously troubled  He turned aside and said that he had accepted a speaking engagement in Des Moines  Iowa  in three days and that the U S  Secret Service had warned him that it had uncovered evidence of plots by radical elements to assassinate him if he kept it  Turmoil and uncertainty prevailed in the country  but there was absolutely no fear in his expression  to the contrary  there appeared to be an abundance of personal courage  Frankly  my heart went out to him  but I pointed out that fate and destiny played a part in the lives of all presidents and that I felt all possible precautions should be taken to protect him but that he should appear and make one of the greatest speeches of his administration  He smiled and said   Osro  that s what I have already decided to do  Your concurrence is comforting          Despite the late campaign endeavors  Hoover sustained a large defeat in the election  having procured only 39 7 percent of the popular vote to Roosevelt s 57 4 percent  Hoover s popular vote was reduced by 26 percentage points from his result in the 1928 election  In the electoral college he carried only Pennsylvania  Delaware  and four other Northeastern states to lose 59472  The Democrats extended their control over the U S  House and gained control of the U S  Senate   After the election  Hoover requested that Roosevelt retain the Gold standard as the basis of the US currency  and in effect  continue many of the Hoover Administration s economic policies  Roosevelt refused     Hoover departed from Washington in March 1933 with some bitterness  disappointed both that he had been repudiated by the voters and unappreciated for his best efforts  The Hoovers went first to New York City  where they stayed for a while in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel   Later that spring  they returned to California to their Stanford residence  Hoover enjoyed returning to the men s clubs that he had long been involved with  including the Bohemian Club   the Pacific Union Club   and the University Club in San Francisco     Hoover liked to drive his car  accompanied by his wife or a friend  former Presidents did not get Secret Service protection until the 1960s   and drive on wandering journeys  visiting Western mining camps or small towns where he often went unrecognized  or heading up to the mountains  or deep into the woods  to go fishing in relative solitude  A year before his death  his own fishing days behind him  he published Fishing For FunAnd To Wash Your Soul   the last of more than sixteen books in his lifetime   Although many of his friends and supporters called upon Hoover to speak out against FDR s New Deal and to assume his place as the voice of the  loyal opposition   he refused to do so for many years after leaving the White House  and he largely kept himself out of the public spotlight until late in 1934  However  that did not stop rumors springing up about him  often fanned by Democratic politicians who found the former President to be a convenient scapegoat    The relationship between Hoover and Roosevelt was one of the most severely strained in Presidential history  Hoover had little good to say about his successor  FDR  in turn  supposedly engaged in various petty official acts aimed at his predecessor  ranging from dropping him from the White House birthday greetings message list to having Hoover s name struck from the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River  which would officially be known only as Boulder Dam for many years to come   In 1936   Hoover entertained hopes of receiving the Republican presidential nomination again  and thus facing Roosevelt in a rematch  However  although he retained strong support among some delegates  there was never much hope of his being selected  He publicly endorsed the nominee  Kansas Governor Alf Landon   But Hoover might as well have been the nominee  since the Democrats virtually ignored Landon  and they ran against the former President himself  constantly attacking him in speeches and warning that a Landon victory would put Hoover back in the White House as the secret power  behind the throne   Roosevelt won 46 of the 48 states  burying Landon in the Electoral College  and the Republican Party in Congress in another landslide   Although Hoover s reputation was at its low point  circumstances began to rehabilitate his name and restore him to prominence  Roosevelt overreached on his Supreme Court packing plan  and a further financial recession in 1937 and 1938 tarnished his image of invincibility   In 1939  former President Herbert Hoover became the first Honorary Chairman of Tolstoy Foundation in Valley Cottage  New York   served in this capacity until his death in 1964     By 1940  Hoover was again being spoken of as the possible nominee of the party in the presidential election   Although he trailed in the polls behind Thomas Dewey   Arthur Vandenberg   and his own former protege  Robert A  Taft   he still had considerable first ballot delegate strength  and it was believed that if the convention deadlocked between the leading candidates  the party might turn to him as its compromise  However  the convention nominated the utility company president Wendell Willkie   who had supported Roosevelt in 1932 but turned against him after the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority forced him to sell his company  Hoover dutifully supported Willkie  although he despaired that the nominee endorsed a platform that  to Hoover  was little more than the New Deal in all but name   Hoover visited 10 European countries in March 1938  the month of Nazi Germany  s Anschluss of Austria   and stated  I do not believe a widespread war is at all probable in the near future  There is a general realization everywhere     that civilization as we know it cannot survive another great war     Like many  he initially believed that the European Allies would be able to contain Germany  and that Imperial Japan would not attack American interests in the Pacific   Unlike Roosevelt s administration  Hoover was a vocal supporter of providing relief to countries in Nazi occupied Europe     He was instrumental in creating the Commission for Polish Relief and Finnish Relief Fund        When the Germans overran France and then had Britain held in a stalemate  many Americans saw Britain as on the verge of collapse  Nonetheless  Hoover declared that it would be folly for the United States to declare war on Germany and to rush to save the United Kingdom  Rather  he held  it was far wiser for this nation to devote itself to building up its own defenses  and to wash its hands of the mess in Europe  He called for a  Fortress America  concept  in which the United States  protected on the East and on the West by vast oceans patrolled by its Navy and its Air Corps  the USAAF    could adequately repel any attack on the Americas   During a radio broadcast on June 29  1941  one week after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union  Hoover disparaged any  tacit alliance  between the U S  and the USSR by saying   If we go further and join the war and we win  then we have won for Stalin the grip of communism on Russia    Again I say  if we join the war and Stalin wins  we have aided him to impose more communism on Europe and the world  At least we could not with such a bedfellow say to our sons that by making the supreme sacrifice  they are restoring freedom to the world  War alongside Stalin to impose freedom is more than a travesty  It is a tragedy     When the United States entered the war following the December 7  1941  Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor   Hoover swept aside all feelings of neutrality and called for total victory  He offered himself to the government in any capacity necessary  but the Roosevelt Administration did not call upon him to serve   Following World War II   Hoover became friends with President Harry S  Truman   Hoover joked that they were for many years the sole members of the  trade union  of former Presidents  since Calvin Coolidge and Roosevelt were dead already   Because of Hoover s previous experience with Germany at the end of World War I  in 1946 President Truman selected the former president to tour Germany to ascertain the food status of the occupied nation  Hoover toured what was to become West Germany in Hermann Gring  s old train coach and produced a number of reports critical of U S  occupation policy  The economy of Germany had  sunk to the lowest level in a hundred years     He stated in one report   There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a   pastoral state    It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25 000 000 people out of it     On Hoover s initiative  a school meals program in the American and British occupation zones of Germany was begun on April 14  1947  The program served 3 500 000 children aged six through 18  A total of 40 000 tons of American food was provided during the Hooverspeisung  Hoover meals    In 1947  President Harry S  Truman appointed Hoover to a commission  which elected him chairman  to reorganize the executive departments  This became known as the Hoover Commission   He was appointed chairman of a similar commission by President Dwight D  Eisenhower in 1953  Both found numerous inefficiencies and ways to reduce waste  The government enacted most of the recommendations that the two commissions had made  71  of the first commission s and 64  of the second commission s   Throughout the Cold War   Hoover  always an opponent of Marxism   became even more outspokenly anti Communist     However  he vehemently opposed American involvement in the Korean War   saying that  To commit the sparse ground forces of the non communist nations into a land war against this communist land mass  in Asia  would be a war without victory  a war without a successful political terminal    that would be the graveyard of millions of American boys and the exhaustion of the United States      Despite his advancing years  Hoover continued to work nearly full time both on writing  among his literary works is The Ordeal of Woodrow Wilson   a bestseller  and the first time one former President had ever written a biography about another   as well as overseeing the Hoover Institution at Stanford University   which housed not only his own professional papers  but also those of a number of other former high ranking governmental and military servants  He also threw himself into fund raising for the Boys Clubs  now the Boys   Girls Clubs of America    which became his pet charity   From Coolidge s death in 1933 to Dwight D  Eisenhower  s last day of serving the presidency in 1961  Hoover had been the only living Republican former president  In 1960  Hoover appeared at his final Republican National Convention  Since the 1948 convention  he had been feted as the guest of  farewell  ceremonies  the unspoken assumption being that the aging former President might not survive until the next convention   Joking to the delegates  he said   Apparently  my last three good byes didn t take   Although he lived to see the 1964 convention  ill health prevented him from attending  The Presidential nominee Barry Goldwater acknowledged Hoover s absence in his acceptance speech  In 1962  Hoover had a malignant intestinal tumor removed  Ten months later he had severe gastrointestinal bleeding and seemed terminally ill and frail  but his mind was clear and he maintained a great deal of correspondence  Although the illness would get worse over time  he refused to be hospitalized   Hoover died following massive internal bleeding at the age of 90 in his New York City suite at 11 35a m  on October 20  1964    31 years  seven months  and sixteen days after leaving office  At the time of his death  he had the longest retirement of any President  Former President Jimmy Carter surpassed the length of Hoover s retirement on September 7  2012  At the time of Hoover s death he was the second longest lived president after John Adams   both were since surpassed by Gerald Ford   Ronald Reagan   George H  W  Bush   and Jimmy Carter   He had outlived by 20 years his wife  Lou Henry Hoover  who had died in 1944  and he was the last living member of the Coolidge administration  He also outlived both his successor Franklin D  Roosevelt   and Eleanor Roosevelt who died in 1945 and 1962  respectively  Hoover was the last President to be the only living ex President until the death of Lyndon B  Johnson in 1973  thus making Richard Nixon the most recent President to be the only living ex President  Hoover s time as only living President was also the shortest in history  at one day less than two months   By the time of his death  he had rehabilitated his image    His birthplace in Iowa and an Oregon home where he lived as a child  became National Landmarks during his lifetime  His Rapidan fishing camp in Virginia  which he had donated to the government in 1933  is now a National Historic Landmark within the Shenandoah National Park   Hoover and his wife are buried at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum in West Branch  Iowa   Hoover was honored with a state funeral   the last of three in a span of 12 months  coming as it did just after the deaths of President John F  Kennedy and General Douglas MacArthur   Former Chaplain of the Senate Frederick Brown Harris officiated  All three had two things in common  the commanding general of the Military District of Washington during those funerals was Army Major General Philip C  Wehle and the riderless horse was Black Jack   who also served in that role during Lyndon B  Johnson  s funeral   Hoover began his magnum opus Freedom Betrayed   in 1944 as part of a proposed autobiography  This turned into a significant work critiquing the foreign policy of the United States during the period from the 1930s to 1945  Essentially an attack on the statesmanship of Franklin D  Roosevelt   Hoover completed this work in his 90th year but it was not published until the historian George H  Nash took on the task of editing it  Significant themes are his belief that the western democratic powers should have let Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia assail and weaken each other  and opposition to the British guarantee of Poland s independence     The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum is located in West Branch  Iowa next to the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site   The library is one of thirteen presidential libraries run by the National Archives and Records Administration   The Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover House   built in 1919 in Stanford  California   is now the official residence of the president of Stanford University   and a National Historic Landmark   Hoover s rustic rural presidential retreat  Rapidan Camp  also known as Camp Hoover  in the Shenandoah National Park   Virginia  has been restored and opened to the public  The Hoover Dam is named in his honor  as are numerous elementary   middle   and high schools across the United States   On December 10  2008  Hoover s great granddaughter Margaret Hoover and Senate of Puerto Rico President Kenneth McClintock unveiled a life sized bronze statue of Hoover at Puerto Rico s Territorial Capitol  The statue is one of seven honoring Presidents who have visited the United States territory during their term of office   One line in the All in the Family theme songan ironic exercise in preNew Deal nostalgiasays  Mister  we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again    The Belgian city of Leuven named a square in the city center after Hoover  honoring him for his work as chairman of the  Commission for Relief in Belgium  during World War I  The square is near the Central Library of the Catholic University of Leuven  where a bust of the president can be seen   The Polish capital of Warsaw also has a square named after Hoover alongside the Royal Route leading to the Old Town     George

March 18  1837 June 24  1908  was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States    He was the winner of the popular vote for president three times in 1884   1888   and 1892  and was one of the two Democrats  alongside Woodrow Wilson   elected to the presidency in the era of Republican political domination dating from 1861 to 1933  He is the only President in American history to serve two non consecutive terms in office   Cleveland was the leader of the pro business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs   Free Silver   inflation  imperialism   and subsidies to business  farmers  or veterans  His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era    Cleveland won praise for his honesty  self reliance  integrity  and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism     He relentlessly fought political corruption  patronage and bossism  Indeed  as a reformer his prestige was so strong that the like minded wing of the Republican Party  called   Mugwumps    largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election     As his second term began  disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression  which Cleveland was unable to reverse  It ruined his Democratic Party  opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896  The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System as well as the Progressive Era      Cleveland was a formidable policymaker  and he also drew corresponding criticism  His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois  his support of the gold standard and opposition to Free Silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party    Furthermore  critics complained that he had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation s economic disasters depressions and strikesin his second term    Even so  his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term  Biographer Allan Nevins wrote    I n Grover Cleveland the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities  He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have  He possessed honesty  courage  firmness  independence  and common sense  But he possessed them to a degree other men do not       Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18  1837  in Caldwell  New Jersey to Richard Falley Cleveland and Ann Neal Cleveland    Cleveland s father was a Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut     and his mother was from Baltimore   the daughter of a bookseller    On his father s side  Cleveland was descended from English ancestors  the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland   England in 1635    On his mother s side  he was descended from Anglo Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia    He was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland after whom the city of Cleveland   Ohio  was named     Cleveland  the fifth of nine children  was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell  where his father was pastor at the time  he became known as Grover in his adult life    In 1841  the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville  New York   where Grover spent much of his childhood    Neighbors later described him as  full of fun and inclined to play pranks    and fond of outdoor sports    In 1850  Cleveland s father took a pastorate in Clinton  Oneida County  New York   and the family relocated there    Despite his father s dedication to his missionary work  the income was insufficient for the large family  Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville  The experience was valuable and brief  and the living conditions quite austere  Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the contract    When the Clinton pastorate proved too arduous in 1853  Cleveland s father took an assignment in Holland Patent  New York   near Utica and the family moved again    Shortly after  he died     Cleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy    After his father died in 1853  he again left school so as to help support his family  Later that year  Cleveland s brother William was hired as a teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City  and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher  He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854 and an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister  Cleveland declined  and in 1855 he decided to move west    He stopped first in Buffalo  New York   where his uncle  Lewis W  Allen gave him a clerical job    Allen was an important man in Buffalo  and he introduced his nephew to influential men there  including the partners in the law firm of Rogers  Bowen  and Rogers    Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm  began to read the law  and was admitted to the bar in 1859     Cleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years  then left the firm in 1862 to start his own practice    In January 1863  he was appointed assistant district attorney of Erie County     With the American Civil War raging  Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863   requiring able bodied men to serve in the army if called upon  or else to hire a substitute    Cleveland chose the latter course  paying George Benninsky  a thirty two year old Polish immigrant   150 to serve in his place    As a lawyer  Cleveland became known for his single minded concentration and dedication to hard work    In 1866  he successfully defended some participants in the Fenian raid free of charge    In 1868  Cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a libel suit against the editor of Buffalo s Commercial Advertiser     During this time  Cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity  taking residence in a plain boarding house   Cleveland dedicated his growing income instead to the support of his mother and younger sisters    While his personal quarters were austere  Cleveland nevertheless enjoyed an active social life and  the easy going sociability of hotel lobbies and saloons      He shunned the circles of higher society of Buffalo in which his uncle s family traveled     From his earliest involvement in politics  Cleveland aligned himself with the Democratic Party      he had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln   and the heads of the Rogers law firm were solid Democrats    In 1865  he ran for District Attorney   losing narrowly to his friend and roommate  Lyman K  Bass   the Republican nominee    In 1870  with the help of his friend Oscar Folsom  he secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County     He won the election by a 303 vote margin and took the office of Sheriff on January 1  1871 at age 33    While this new career took him away from the practice of law  it was rewarding in other ways  the fees were said to yield up to  40 000  US 800 000 today     over the two year term     Cleveland s service as sheriff was unremarkable  biographer Rexford Tugwell described Cleveland s time in the office as a waste politically  Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff s office during his tenure and chose not to confront it    A notable incident of his term took place on September 6  1872  and involved the execution of Patrick Morrissey  who had been convicted of murdering his mother    As sheriff  Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy  10 to perform the task    Cleveland  in spite of reservations about the hanging  opted to carry out the duty himself    he hanged another murderer  John Gaffney   on February 14  1873     After his term as sheriff ended  Cleveland returned to his law practice  opening a firm with his friends Lyman K  Bass and Wilson S  Bissell     Bass did not spend much time at the firm  being elected to Congress in 1873  but Cleveland and Bissell soon found themselves at the top of Buffalo s legal community    Up to that point  Cleveland s political career had been honorable and unexceptional  As biographer Allan Nevins wrote   Probably no man in the country  on March 4  1881  had less thought than this limited  simple  sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in Washington and taking the oath as President of the United States      It was during this period that Cleveland began a brief relationship with a widow  Maria Crofts Halpin  and later assumed responsibility for supporting her and a child born at the time  The matter became a campaign issue for the GOP in his first presidential campaign     In the 1870s  the municipal government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt  with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating to share the spoils of political office    In 1881 the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians  the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate    The party leaders approached Cleveland  and he agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo   provided that the rest of the ticket was to his liking    When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket  Cleveland accepted the nomination    Cleveland was elected mayor with 15 120 votes  as against 11 528 for Milton C  Beebe  his opponent    He took office January 2  1882   Cleveland s term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines    Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street cleaning bill passed by the Common Council     The street cleaning contract was open for bids  and the Council selected the highest bidder at  422 000  rather than the lowest of  100 000 less  because of the political connections of the bidder    While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo  Mayor Cleveland would have none of it  and replied with a stinging veto message   I regard it as the culmination of a most bare faced  impudent  and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people  and to worse than squander the public money     The Council reversed themselves and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder    Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally  this plan was successfully adopted    For this  and other actions safeguarding public funds  Cleveland s reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond Erie County     New York Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor    Daniel Manning   a party insider who admired Cleveland s record  was instrumental in his candidacy    With a split in the state Republican party in 1882  the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage  indeed there were several contenders for that party s nomination    The two leading Democratic candidates were Roswell P  Flower and Henry W  Slocum   Their factions deadlocked  and the convention could not agree on a nominee    Cleveland  in third place on the first ballot  picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice    The Republican party remained divided against itself  and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor  with 535 318 votes to Republican nominee Charles J  Folger  s 342 464    Cleveland s margin of victory was  at the time  the largest in a contested New York election  the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the New York State Legislature      Cleveland brought his opposition to needless spending to the governor s office  he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos in his first two months in office    The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents    The bill had broad support because the trains  owner  Jay Gould   was unpopular  and his fare increases were widely denounced    Cleveland  however  saw the bill as unjustGould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again    Moreover  Cleveland believed that altering Gould s franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution     Despite the initial popularity of the fare reduction bill  the newspapers praised Cleveland s veto    Theodore Roosevelt   then a member of the Assembly   had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected  in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons    After the veto  Roosevelt reversed himself  as did many legislators  and the veto was sustained     Cleveland s defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim  and the enmity of the influential Tammany Hall organization in New York City    Tammany  under its boss  John Kelly   had disapproved of Cleveland s nomination as governor  and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re election of their point man in the State Senate  Thomas F  Grady     Cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the Tammanyites  as well as bills passed as a result of their deal making    The loss of Tammany s support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments     The Republicans convened in Chicago and nominated former Speaker of the House James G  Blaine of Maine for president on the fourth ballot  Blaine s nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral    The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps  and the Conkling faction  recently disenfranchised by President Arthur    Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans  choice as an opportunity to win the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found     Among the Democrats  Samuel J  Tilden was the initial front runner  having been the party s nominee in the contested election of 1876     After Tilden declined a nomination due to his poor health  his supporters shifted to several other contenders    Cleveland was among the leaders in early support  and Thomas F  Bayard of Delaware   Allen G  Thurman of Ohio   Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa   and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings  along with various favorite sons     Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination  Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861  making him unacceptable to Northerners  Butler  conversely  was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War   Thurman was generally well liked  but was growing old and infirm  and his views on the silver question were uncertain    Cleveland  too  had detractorsTammany remained opposed to himbut the nature of his enemies made him still more friends    Cleveland led on the first ballot  with 392 votes out of 820    On the second ballot  Tammany threw its support behind Butler  but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland  who won    Thomas A  Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate     Corruption in politics was the central issue in 1884  indeed  Blaine had over the span of his career been involved in several questionable deals    Cleveland s reputation as an opponent of corruption proved the Democrats  strongest asset    William C  Hudson created Cleveland s contextual campaign slogan  A public office is a public trust     Reform minded Republicans called   Mugwumps   denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland    The Mugwumps  including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher   were more concerned with morality than with party  and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government    At the same time the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps  they lost some blue collar workers to the Greenback Labor party   led by ex Democrat Benjamin Butler    In general  Cleveland abided by the precedent of minimizing presidential campaign travel and speechmaking  Blaine became one of the first to break with that tradition     The campaign focused on the candidates  moral standards  as each side cast aspersions on their opponents  Cleveland s supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad and the Union Pacific Railway   later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies    Although the stories of Blaine s favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier  this time Blaine s correspondence was discovered  making his earlier denials less plausible    On some of the most damaging correspondence  Blaine had written  Burn this letter   giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry   Blaine  Blaine  James G  Blaine  the continental liar from the state of Maine   Burn this letter      Commentator Jeff Jacoby notes that   Not since George Washington had a candidate for President been so renowned for his rectitude     The Republicans found a refutation buried in Cleveland s past  Aided by sermons from an opportunistic preacher named George H  Ball  they charged that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer in Buffalo  and chanted   Ma  Ma  where s my Pa     When confronted with the scandal  Cleveland s immediately instructed his supporters to  Above all  tell the truth   Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin  the woman who claimed he fathered her child  who she had named Oscar Folsom Cleveland  Halpin had been involved with several men at the time  including Cleveland s friend and law partner  Oscar Folsom  for whom the child was named  Cleveland did not know which man was the father  he assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them    Shortly before the 1884 election   the Republican media published an affidavit from Halpin in which she stated that until she met Cleveland  her  life was pure and spotless   and  there is not  and never was  a doubt as to the paternity of our child  and the attempt of Grover Cleveland  or his friends  to couple the name of Oscar Folsom  or any one else  with that boy  for that purpose is simply infamous and false      The electoral votes of closely contested New York  New Jersey  Indiana  and Connecticut would determine the election    In New York  the Tammany Democrats decided that they would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them    Blaine hoped that he would have more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did  while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century  Blaine s mother was Irish Catholic  and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State    The Irish  a significant group in three of the swing states   did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican  Samuel D  Burchard   gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats  denouncing them as the party of  Rum  Romanism   and Rebellion     The Democrats spread the word of this implied Catholic insult on the eve of the election  They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City s wealthiest men     After the votes were counted  Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states  including New York by 1200 votes    While the popular vote total was close  with Cleveland winning by just one quarter of a percent  the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219182    Following the electoral victory  the  Ma  Ma     attack phrase gained a classic riposte   Gone to the White House  Ha  Ha  Ha      Soon after taking office  Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment  These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system   but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well  and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service    He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees  as many departments had become bloated with political time servers    Later in his term  as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils  Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats     this was especially the case with policy making positions    While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns  more of Cleveland s appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors  administrations     Cleveland also reformed other parts of the government  In 1887  he signed an act creating the Interstate Commerce Commission     He and Secretary of the Navy William C  Whitney undertook to modernize the navy and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships    Cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by government grant    Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q C  Lamar charged that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements    The lands were forfeited  resulting in the return of approximately 81 000 000 acres  330 000km 2       Cleveland was the first Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which originated in 1867  the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent  Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887     Cleveland faced a Republican Senate and often resorted to using his veto powers    He vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for American Civil War veterans  believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the Pension Bureau   Congress should not attempt to override that decision    When Congress  pressured by the Grand Army of the Republic   passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service  Cleveland also vetoed that    Cleveland used the veto far more often than any president up to that time    In 1887  Cleveland issued his most well known veto  that of the Texas Seed Bill     After a drought had ruined crops in several Texas counties  Congress appropriated  10 000 to purchase seed grain for farmers there    Cleveland vetoed the expenditure  In his veto message  he espoused a theory of limited government   I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution  and I do not believe that the power and duty of the general government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering which is in no manner properly related to the public service or benefit  A prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should  I think  be steadfastly resisted  to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforced that  though the people support the government  the government should not support the people  The friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellow citizens in misfortune  This has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated  Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character  while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood     One of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver   or by gold alone     The issue cut across party lines  with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver  and both parties  representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard    Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold  taxpayers paid their government bills in silver  while international creditors demanded payment in gold  resulting in a depletion of the nation s gold supply     Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood firmly on the side of the gold standard  and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the Bland Allison Act of 1878    Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated    Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents    In reply  one of the foremost silverites  Richard P  Bland   introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver  inflating the then deflating currency    While Bland s bill was defeated  so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement    The result was a retention of the status quo  and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue     Another contentious financial issue at the time was the protective tariff   While it had not been a central point in his campaign  Cleveland s opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats  that the tariff ought to be reduced    Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries    American tariffs had been high since the Civil War  and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus     In 1886  a bill to reduce the tariff was narrowly defeated in the House    The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year   and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress  but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform    As the surplus grew  Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only    His message to Congress in 1887  quoted at right  highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses    Republicans  as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J  Randall   believed that American industries would fail absent high tariffs  and continued to fight reform efforts    Roger Q  Mills   chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  proposed a bill to reduce the tariff from about 47  to about 40     After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies  the bill passed the House    The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House  and the bill died in the conference committee   Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election   Cleveland was a committed non interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism  He refused to promote the previous administration s Nicaragua canal treaty  and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations    Cleveland s Secretary of State  Thomas F  Bayard   negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada  and struck a conciliatory note  despite the opposition of New England  s Republican Senators    Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U S  interests in the Congo      Cleveland  like a growing number of Northerners  and nearly all white Southerners  saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment  and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U S  Constitution   which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans    Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs  he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington  D C  and appointed another black man to replace Douglass upon his resignation     Although Cleveland had condemned the  outrages  against Chinese immigrants  he believed that Chinese immigrants were unwilling to assimilate into white society    Secretary of State Thomas F  Bayard negotiated an extension to the Chinese Exclusion Act   and Cleveland lobbied the Congress to pass the Scott Act   written by Congressman William Lawrence Scott   which prevented the return of Chinese immigrants who left the United States    The Scott Act easily passed both houses of Congress  and Cleveland signed it into law on October 1  1888     Cleveland viewed Native Americans as wards of the state   saying in his first inaugural address that   t his guardianship involves  on our part  efforts for the improvement of their condition and enforcement of their rights     He encouraged the idea of cultural assimilation  pushing for the passage of the Dawes Act   which provided for distribution of Indian lands to individual members of tribes  rather than having them continued to be held in trust for the tribes by the federal government    While a conference of Native leaders endorsed the act  in practice the majority of Native Americans disapproved of it    Cleveland believed the Dawes Act would lift Native Americans out of poverty and encourage their assimilation into white society  It ultimately weakened the tribal governments and allowed individual Indians to sell land and keep the money     In the month before Cleveland s 1885 inauguration  President Arthur opened four million acres of Winnebago and Crow Creek Indian lands in the Dakota Territory to white settlement by executive order    Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them    Cleveland believed Arthur s order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes  and rescinded it on April 17 of that year  ordering the settlers out of the territory    Cleveland sent in Eighteenth Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan to investigate the matter     Cleveland entered the White House as a bachelor  and his sister Rose Cleveland joined him  to act as hostess for the first two years of his administration    However  unlike the previous bachelor president James Buchanan   Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for very long  In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland s friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington    Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College   When she returned to school  President Cleveland received her mother s permission to correspond with her  and they were soon engaged to be married    On June 2  1886  Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the Blue Room at the White House    He was the second President to wed while in office    and has been the only President married in the White House  This marriage was unusual  since Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom s estate and had supervised Frances  upbringing after her father s death  nevertheless  the public took no exception to the match    At 21 years  Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest First Lady in history  and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality     The Clevelands had five children  Ruth  18911904   Esther  18931980   Marion  18951977   Richard Folsom  18971974   and Francis Grover  19031995   British philosopher Philippa Foot was their granddaughter     During his first term  Cleveland successfully nominated two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States   The first  Lucius Q C  Lamar   was a former Mississippi Senator who served in Cleveland s Cabinet as Interior Secretary  When William Burnham Woods died  Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887  While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator  his service under the Confederacy two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him  Lamar s nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28     Chief Justice Morrison Waite died a few months later  and Cleveland nominated Melville Fuller to fill his seat on April 30  1888  Fuller accepted  He had previously declined Cleveland s nomination to the Civil Service Commission   preferring his Chicago law practice  The Senate Judiciary Committee spent several months examining the little known nominee  before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20       Cleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices  These included two judges to the United States circuit courts   nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 30 judges to the United States district courts   Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals  he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies  The other  Benjamin Harrison  was in office at the time that the change was made  Thus  all of Cleveland s appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term  and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second   The Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison of Indiana for President and Levi P  Morton of New York for Vice President  Cleveland was easily renominated at the Democratic convention in St  Louis     Vice President Hendricks died in 1885  so the Democrats chose Allen G  Thurman of Ohio to be Cleveland s running mate     The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign  as Cleveland s campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S  Brice and William H  Barnum   whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matt Quay and John Wanamaker      The Republicans campaigned heavily on the tariff issue  turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North    Further  the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B  Hill   weakening Cleveland s support in that swing state     As in 1884  the election focused on the swing states of New York  New Jersey   Connecticut   and Indiana   But unlike that year  when Cleveland had triumphed in all four  in 1888 he won only two  losing his home state of New York by 14 373 votes    The Republicans won Indiana  largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as Blocks of Five     Republican victory in that state  where Cleveland lost by just 2 348 votes  was sufficient to propel Harrison to victory  despite his loss of the nationwide popular vote    Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life     As Frances Cleveland left the White House  she told a staff member   Now  Jerry  I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house  for I want to find everything just as it is now  when we come back again   When asked when she would return  she responded   We are coming back four years from today     In the meantime  the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs  Stetson   Tracy  and MacVeigh  This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement  though quite compatible  Cleveland s law practice brought only a moderate income  perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple s vacation home Grey Gables at Buzzard Bay  where fishing became his obsession    While they lived in New York  the Clevelands  first child  Ruth  was born in 1891     The Harrison administration worked with Congress to pass the McKinley Tariff   an aggressively protectionist measure and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act   which increased money backed by silver    these were among policies Cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nation s financial health    At first he refrained from criticizing his successor  but by 1891 Cleveland felt compelled to speak out  addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in New York    The  silver letter  thrust Cleveland s name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching     Cleveland s enduring reputation as chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination    His leading opponent was David B  Hill   a Senator for New York    Hill united the anti Cleveland elements of the Democratic partysilverites  protectionists  and Tammany Hallbut was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination    Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill  Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the convention in Chicago    For vice president  the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E  Stevenson of Illinois  a silverite    Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P  Gray of Indiana for vice president  they accepted the convention favorite    As a supporter of greenbacks and Free Silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts  Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard money   gold standard ticket headed by Cleveland     The Republicans re nominated President Harrison  making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier  Unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876  1884  and 1888  the 1892 election was  according to Cleveland biographer Allan Nevins    the cleanest  quietest  and most creditable in the memory of the post war generation     in part because Harrison s wife  Caroline  was dying of tuberculosis    Harrison did not personally campaign at all  Following Caroline Harrison s death on October 25  two weeks before the national election  Cleveland and all of the other candidates stopped campaigning  thus making Election Day a somber and quiet event for the whole country as well as the candidates   The issue of the tariff worked to the Republicans  advantage in 1888  The legislative revisions of the past four years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business    Many Westerners  traditionally Republican voters  defected to James Weaver   the candidate of the new Populist Party   Weaver promised Free Silver  generous veterans  pensions  and an eight hour work day     The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket  allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York    At the campaign s end  many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co    The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes  and it was Cleveland s third consecutive popular vote plurality     Shortly after Cleveland s second term began  the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market  and he soon faced an acute economic depression     The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the increased coinage of silver  and Cleveland called Congress into special session to deal with the problem    The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever  and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act     Even so  the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago  and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin    In the Senate  the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious  Cleveland  forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal  convinced enough Democrats  and along with eastern Republicans  they formed a 4837 majority for repeal    Depletion of the Treasury s gold reserves continued  at a lesser rate  and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold    At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites  but it marked the beginning of the end of silver as a basis for American currency     Having succeeded in reversing the Harrison administration s silver policy  Cleveland sought next to reverse the effects of the McKinley tariff   The Wilson Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L  Wilson in December 1893    After lengthy debate  the bill passed the House by a considerable margin    The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff  especially on raw materials    The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above  4 000    US 105 000 today       The bill was next considered in the Senate  where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland  who insisted on more protection for their states  industries than the Wilson bill allowed    The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms    The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer    Cleveland was outraged with the final bill  and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests    Even so  he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature     In 1892  Cleveland had campaigned against the Force Bill     which would have strengthened the voting rights protections of the Enforcement Act of 1871   That law provided for a detailed federal supervision of the electoral process  from registration to the certification of returns  Cleveland succeeded in ushering in its repeal in 1894  ch  25  28 Stat  36      The pendulum thus swung from attempting to protect voting rights more strongly to repealing protections of voting rights  this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in Giles v  Harris   189 U S  475  1903   and Giles v  Teasley   193 U S  146  1904    The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor conditions across the United States  and the victory of anti silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers    A group of workingmen led by Jacob S  Coxey began to march east toward Washington  D C  to protest Cleveland s policies    This group  known as Coxey s Army   agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen  and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts    By the time they reached Washington  only a few hundred remained  and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the United States Capitol   the group scattered    Even though Coxey s Army may not have been a threat to the government  it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies     The Pullman Strike had a significantly greater impact than Coxey s Army  A strike began against the Pullman Company over low wages and twelve hour workdays  and sympathy strikes  led by American Railway Union leader Eugene V  Debs   soon followed    By June 1894  125 000 railroad workers were on strike  paralyzing the nation s commerce    Because the railroads carried the mail   and because several of the affected lines were in federal receivership   Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate    Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court  and when the strikers refused to obey it  he sent federal troops into Chicago and 20 other rail centers     If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago   he proclaimed   that card will be delivered     Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat John P  Altgeld of Illinois  who became his bitter foe in 1896  Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland s actions  but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration     Just before the 1894 election  Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson  an advisor   The warning was appropriate  for in the Congressional elections  Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades  taking full control of the House  while the Populists lost most of their support  Cleveland s factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state  including full control in Illinois and Michigan  and made major gains in Ohio  Indiana  Iowa and other states  Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland s allies  The opposition Democrats were close to controlling two thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention  which they needed to nominate their own candidate  They failed for lack of unity and a national leader  as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President     When Cleveland took office he faced the question of Hawaiian annexation  In his first term  he had supported free trade with Hawai i and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in Pearl Harbor     In the intervening four years  Honolulu businessmen of European and American ancestry had denounced Queen Liliuokalani as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government  In early 1893 they overthrew her   set up a republican government under Sanford B  Dole   and sought to join the United States    The Harrison administration had quickly agreed with representatives of the new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval    Five days after taking office on March 9  1893  Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman James Henderson Blount to Hawai i to investigate the conditions there     Cleveland agreed with Blount s report  which found the populace to be opposed to annexation    Liliuokalani initially refused to grant amnesty as a condition of her reinstatement  saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu  but Dole s government refused to yield their position    By December 1893  the matter was still unresolved  and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress    In his message to Congress  Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non intervention  see excerpt at right     The Senate  under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland  commissioned and produced the Morgan Report   which contradicted Blount s findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair    Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen  and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii      Closer to home  Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine that not only prohibited new European colonies  but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere    When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana   Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested    British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington  Julian Pauncefote misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to the American government and prolongied the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration      A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter  and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana    But by standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power  Cleveland improved relations with the United States  southern neighbors  and at the same time  the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain     In the midst of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893  Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor  Dr  O Reilly  about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater like edge ulcer with a granulated surface on the left side of Cleveland s hard palate   Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the army medical museum  The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer  but instead an epithelioma      Cleveland decided to have surgery secretly  to avoid further panic that might worsen the financial depression    The surgery occurred on July 1  to give Cleveland time to make a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session    Under the guise of a vacation cruise  Cleveland and his surgeon  Dr  Joseph Bryant   left for New York  The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida   a yacht owned by Cleveland s friend E  C  Benedict   as it sailed off Long Island     The surgery was conducted through the President s mouth  to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery    The team  sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether   successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate    The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland s mouth disfigured    During another surgery  Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance    A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated    Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation  the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland s vacation    In 1917  one of the surgeons present on the Oneida   Dr  William W  Keen   wrote an article detailing the operation     Cleveland enjoyed many years of life after the tumor was removed  and there was some debate as to whether it was actually malignant  Several doctors  including Dr  Keen  stated after Cleveland s death that the tumor was a carcinoma     Other suggestions included ameloblastoma   or a benign salivary mixed tumor  also known as a pleomorphic adenoma      In the 1980s  analysis of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be verrucous carcinoma     a low grade epithelial cancer with a low potential for metastasis      Cleveland s trouble with the Senate hindered the success of his nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term  In 1893  after the death of Samuel Blatchford   Cleveland nominated William B  Hornblower to the Court    Hornblower  the head of a New York City law firm  was thought to be a qualified appointee  but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator David B  Hill his enemy    Further  Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee  leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved    The Senate rejected Hornblower s nomination on January 15  1894  by a vote of 30 to 24     Cleveland continued to defy the Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill s machine in that state    Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham s confirmation  and on February 16  1894  the Senate rejected the nomination by a vote of 32 to 41    Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R  Coudert   but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice  that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana   whose nomination was accepted unanimously    Later  in 1896  another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again  but he declined to be nominated    Instead  Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham   the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham  and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily     In Cleveland s first term  no new states had been admitted in more than a decade  owing to Congressional Democrats  reluctance to admit states they believed would send Republican members  When Harrison took office  he and the Republican Congress admitted six states North Dakota   South Dakota   Montana   Washington   Idaho   and Wyoming all of which were expected to send Republican delegations  Utah   however  was believed to be Democratic  This  combined with uncertainty about Mormon polygamy  disavowed in 1890   led it to be excluded from the new states  When Cleveland won election to a second term  he and the Democratic majority in the 53rd United States Congress passed an Enabling Act in 1894 that permitted Utah to apply for statehood    Utah joined the Union as the 45th state on January 4  1896   Cleveland s agrarian and silverite enemies gained control of the Democratic party in 1896   repudiated his administration and the gold standard  and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform       Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats  third party ticket that promised to defend the gold standard   limit government and oppose high tariffs  but he declined their nomination for a third term    The party won only 100 000 votes in the general election  and William McKinley   the Republican nominee  triumphed easily over Bryan    Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900   In 1904 the conservatives  with Cleveland s support  regained control of the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B  Parker      After leaving the White House on March 4  1897  Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate  Westland Mansion   in Princeton  New Jersey     For a time he was a trustee of Princeton University   and was one of the majority of trustees who preferred Dean West s plans for the Graduate School and undergraduate living over those of Woodrow Wilson   then president of the university    Cleveland consulted occasionally with President Theodore Roosevelt  19011909   but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the Coal Strike of 1902     Cleveland still made his views known in political matters  In a 1905 article in The Ladies Home Journal   Cleveland weighed in on the women s suffrage movement  writing that  sensible and responsible women do not want to vote  The relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence      In 1906  a group of New Jersey Democrats promoted Cleveland as a possible candidate for the United States Senate   The incumbent  John F  Dryden   was not seeking re election  and some Democrats felt that the former President could attract the votes of some disaffected Republican legislators who might be drawn to Cleveland s statesmanship and conservatism     Cleveland s health had been declining for several years  and in the autumn of 1907 he fell seriously ill    In 1908  he suffered a heart attack and died    His last words were   I have tried so hard to do right     He is buried in the Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church      In his first term in office  Cleveland sought a summer house to escape the heat and smells of Washington  D C   near enough the capital  He secretly bought a farmhouse  Oak View  or Oak Hill   in a rural upland part of the District of Columbia  in 1886  and remodeled it into a Queen Anne style summer estate  He sold Oak View upon losing his bid for re election in 1888  Not long thereafter  suburban residential development reached the area  which came to be known as Oak View  and then Cleveland Heights  and eventually Cleveland Park

Further reading    William Henry Harrison  February 9  1773  April 4  1841  was the ninth President of the United States  1841   an American military officer and politician   and the last President born as a British subject   He was also the first president to die in office  He was 68 years  23 days old when inaugurated  the oldest president to take office until Ronald Reagan in 1981  Harrison died on his 32nd day in office   a   of complications from pneumonia   serving the shortest tenure in United States presidential history  His death sparked a brief constitutional crisis   but its resolution left unsettled many questions following the presidential line of succession in regards to constitution up until the passage of the 25th Amendment in 1967  He was the grandfather of Benjamin Harrison   who was the 23rd President from 1889 to 1893   Before election as president  Harrison served as the first territorial congressional delegate from the Northwest Territory   governor of the Indiana Territory   and later as a U S  representative and senator from Ohio   He originally gained national fame for leading U S  forces against American Indians at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811    where he earned the nickname  Tippecanoe   or  Old Tippecanoe    As a general in the subsequent War of 1812   his most notable action was in the Battle of the Thames in 1813  which brought an end to hostilities in his region  This battle resulted in the death of Tecumseh and the dissolution of the Indian coalition which he led     After the war  Harrison moved to Ohio  where he was elected to the United States House of Representatives   In 1824  the state legislature elected him to the U S  Senate   He served a truncated term after being appointed as Minister Plenipotentiary to Colombia in May 1828  In Colombia  he spoke with Simn Bolvar   urging his nation to adopt American style democracy   Returning to his farm in Ohio  Harrison lived in relative retirement until he was nominated for the presidency in 1836  Defeated  he retired again to his farm  He was elected president in 1840  and died of pneumonia in April 1841  a month after taking office     William Henry Harrison was born February 9  1773  the youngest of Benjamin Harrison V and Elizabeth Bassett s seven children  They were a prominent political family who lived on Berkeley Plantation in Charles City County  Virginia   where he was born    He was the last president born as a British subject before American Independence   His father was a planter and a delegate to the Continental Congress  17741777   who signed the Declaration of Independence   The senior Harrison was governor of Virginia between 1781 and 1784  during and after the American Revolutionary War     William s older brother  Carter Bassett Harrison   was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Virginia     In 1787  at the age of 14  Harrison entered the Presbyterian HampdenSydney College     He attended the school until 1790  becoming well versed in Latin and basic French  He was removed by his Episcopalian father  possibly because of a religious revival occurring at the school  He briefly attended a boys  academy in Southampton County   He allegedly was influenced by antislavery Quakers and Methodists at the school   Angered  his proslavery father had him transfer to Philadelphia for medical training  where Harrison boarded with Robert Morris   The young Harrison entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1790  where he studied medicine under Dr  Benjamin Rush     As Harrison later told his biographer  he did not enjoy the subject  Shortly after Harrison started these studies  his father died in 1791  leaving him without funds for further schooling  Eighteen years old  Harrison was left in the guardianship of Morris     Governor Henry Lee of Virginia  a friend of Harrison s father  learned of Harrison s situation after his father s death and persuaded him to join the army  Within 24hours of meeting Lee  Harrison was commissioned as an ensign in the U S  Army   1st Infantry Regiment at the age of 18  He was first assigned to Cincinnati in the Northwest Territory   where the army was engaged in the ongoing Northwest Indian War      General  Mad Anthony  Wayne took command of the western army in 1792 following a disastrous defeat under its previous commander  Arthur St  Clair   Harrison was promoted to lieutenant that summer because of his strict attention to discipline  and the following year  he was promoted to serve as aide de camp   From Wayne  Harrison learned how to successfully command an army on the American frontier   Harrison participated in Wayne s decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794  which brought the Northwest Indian War to a successful close for the United States    After the war  Lieutenant Harrison was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Greenville in 1795  which forced cession of lands by Native Americans and opened much of present day Ohio to settlement by European Americans         After the death of his mother in 1793  Harrison inherited a portion of the family s estate  including about 3 000 acres  12km 2   of land and several slaves  Still in the army at the time  Harrison sold his land to his brother     In 1795 at the age of 22  Harrison met Anna Tuthill Symmes   of North Bend  Ohio   She was a daughter of Anna Tuthill and Judge John Cleves Symmes   a prominent figure in the state and former representative to the Congress of the Confederation     When Harrison asked the judge for permission to marry Anna  he was refused  The pair waited until Symmes left on business  then they eloped and married on November 25  1795    They married at the North Bend home of Dr  Stephen Wood  Treasurer of the Northwest Territory  The couple honeymooned at Fort Washington   as Harrison was still on duty  Two weeks later  at a farewell dinner for General Wayne  Symmes confronted his new son in law for the first time since the wedding  sternly demanding to know how Harrison intended to support a family  Harrison responded   by my sword  and my own right arm  sir     Afterward  still concerned about Harrison s ability to provide for Anna  Symmes sold the young couple 160 acres  65ha  of land in North Bend    Symmes did not come to accept Harrison until he had achieved fame on the battlefield    Together  the Harrisons had 10 children  Nine lived into adulthood and one died in infancy  Anna was frequently in poor health during the marriage  primarily due to her many pregnancies  She nonetheless outlived William by 23 years  dying at age 88 on February 25  1864     In a biography of Walter Francis White   the noted African American civil rights leader and president of the NAACP in the mid 20th century  historian Kenneth Robert Janken notes that White s mother Madeline Harrison traced some of her mixed race white ancestry to Harrison in Virginia  Her family holds that Dilsia  a female slave belonging to William Henry Harrison  had six children by him  born into slavery  Four were said to be sold to a planter in La Grange  Georgia   including a daughter  Marie Harrison  Marie was Madeline s mother     Harrison resigned from the army in 1798   and began campaigning among his friends and family for a post in the Northwest Territorial government  With the aid of his close friend  Secretary of State Timothy Pickering   he was recommended to replace the outgoing Secretary of the Territory  Harrison was appointed to the position  and frequently acted as governor during the absences of Governor Arthur St  Clair      Harrison had many friends in the elite eastern social circles  and quickly gained a reputation among them as a frontier leader  He ran a successful horse breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory  He championed for lower land prices  a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time  The U S  Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs  a policy disliked by many of the territory s residents  When Harrison ran for Congress  he campaigned to work to alter the situation to encourage migration to the territory     In 1799  at age 26  Harrison defeated the son of Arthur St  Clair and was elected as the first delegate representing the Northwest Territory in the Sixth United States Congress   He served from March 4  1799  to May 14  1800      As a delegate from a territory  not a state  he had no authority to vote on bills  but was permitted to serve on a committee  submit legislation  and debate     As delegate   Harrison successfully promoted the passage of the Harrison Land Act   This made it easier for the average settler to buy land in the Northwest Territory by allowing land to be sold in small tracts   The availability of inexpensive land was an important factor in the rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory    Harrison also served on the committee that decided how to divide the Northwest Territory  The committee recommended splitting the territory into two segments  creating the Ohio Territory and the Indiana Territory   The bill  2 Stat  58   passed and the two new territories were established in 1800     Without informing Harrison  President John Adams nominated him to become governor of the new territory  based on his ties to  the west  and seemingly neutral political stances  Harrison was confirmed by the Senate the following day    Caught unaware  Harrison accepted the position only after receiving assurances from the Jeffersonians that he would not be removed from office after they gained power in the upcoming elections    He then resigned from Congress    The Indiana Territory consisted of the future states of Indiana   Illinois   Michigan   Wisconsin   and the eastern portion of Minnesota      Harrison moved to Vincennes   the capital of the newly established Indiana Territory   on January 10  1801    While in Vincennes  Harrison built a plantation style home he named Grouseland for its many birds  It was one of the first brick structures in the territory  The home  which has been restored and has become a popular modern tourist attraction  served as the center of social and political life in the territory    He also built a second home near Corydon   the second capital  at Harrison Valley      As governor  Harrison had wide ranging powers in the new territory  including the authority to appoint all territorial officials  and the territorial legislature  and to control the division of the territory into political districts  A primary responsibility was to obtain title to Indian lands  This would allow European American settlement to expand and increase U S  population to enable the region to gain statehood    Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well  as his political fortunes were tied to Indiana s rise to statehood  In 1803  President Thomas Jefferson granted Harrison authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians   Harrison supervised the development of 13 treaties  through which the territory bought more than 60 000 000 acres  240 000km 2   of land from Indian leaders  including much of present day southern Indiana   The 1804 Treaty of St  Louis with Quashquame led to the surrender by the Sauk and Meskwaki of much of western Illinois and parts of Missouri   This treaty and loss of lands were greatly resented by many of the Sauk  especially Black Hawk   It was the primary reason the Sauk sided with the United Kingdom during the War of 1812   Harrison thought the Treaty of Grouseland in 1805 appeased some of the issues for Indians  but tensions remained high on the frontier   The 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne raised new tensions  Harrison purchased from the Miami tribe   who claimed ownership of the land  more than 2 500 000acres  10 000km  of land inhabited by Shawnee   Kickapoo   Wea   and Piankeshaw peoples  Harrison rushed the process by offering large subsidies to the tribes and their leaders so that he could have the treaty in place before President Jefferson left office and the administration changed      The tribes living on the lands were furious and sought to have the treaty overturned  but were unsuccessful   In 1803  Harrison lobbied Congress to repeal Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance   to permit slavery in the Indiana Territory  He claimed it was necessary to make the region more appealing to settlers and would make the territory economically viable    Congress suspended the article for 10 years  during which time the territories covered by the ordinance were granted the right to decide for themselves whether to permit slavery  That year  Harrison had the appointed territorial legislature authorize indenturing     He attempted to have slavery legalized outright  in both 1805 and 1807  This caused a significant stir in the territory  When in 1809 the legislature was popularly elected for the first time  Harrison found himself at odds with them as the abolitionist party came to power  They immediately blocked his plans for slavery and repealed the indenturing laws he had passed in 1803     President Jefferson  the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance  had made a secret compact with James Lemen to defeat the proslavery movement led by Harrison  Although a slaveholder  he did not want slavery to expand into the Northwest Territory  as he believed the institution should end  Under the  Jefferson Lemen compact   Jefferson donated money to Lemen to found churches in Illinois and Indiana to stop the proslavery movement  In Indiana   the founding of an antislavery church led to citizens  signing a petition and organizing politically to defeat Harrison s efforts to legalize slavery  Jefferson and Lemen were both instrumental in defeating Harrison s attempts in 1805 and 1807 to secure approval of slavery in the territory     An Indian resistance movement against U S  expansion had been growing through the leadership of the Shawnee brothers  Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa  The Prophet   The conflict became known as Tecumseh s War   Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers  He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man s ways  including their clothing  muskets  and especially whiskey  which was becoming known as evil for American Indians     In August 1810  Tecumseh led 400 armed warriors down the Wabash River to meet with Harrison in Vincennes  As the warriors were dressed in war paint  their sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes  The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland  where they met Harrison  Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate  He argued that no one tribe could sell land without the approval of the other tribes  he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty  Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms  and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly    Harrison said the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose  He rejected Tecumseh s claim that all the Indians formed one nation  He said each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to  Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one nation     Tecumseh launched an  impassioned rebuttal   but Harrison was unable to understand his language    A Shawnee friendly to Harrison cocked his pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh s speech was leading to trouble  Some witnesses reported that Tecumseh was encouraging the warriors to kill Harrison  Many of the warriors began to pull their weapons  representing a substantial threat to Harrison and the town  which held a population of only 1 000  Harrison pulled his sword  Tecumseh s warriors backed down after the officers had pulled their firearms in defense of Harrison    Chief Winnemac   who was friendly to Harrison  countered Tecumseh s arguments and told the warriors that since they had come in peace  they should return home in peace  Before leaving  Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the treaty were nullified  he would seek an alliance with the British    After the meeting  Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region  hoping to create a confederation to battle the United States     In 1811  while Tecumseh was traveling  Harrison was authorized by Secretary of War William Eustis to march against the nascent confederation as a show of force  Harrison led an army of more than 1 000 men north to try to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace  Instead  the tribes launched a surprise attack on Harrison s army early on the morning of November 6  in what became known as the Battle of Tippecanoe   Harrison defeated the tribal forces at Prophetstown   next to the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers   Harrison was hailed as a national hero and the battle became famous  However  his troops had greatly outnumbered the attackers  and suffered many more casualties during the battle     When reporting to Secretary Eustis  Harrison informed him the battle occurred near the Tippecanoe River  which led to its naming   and he feared an imminent reprisal attack  The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict  and the secretary at first interpreted it as a defeat  The follow up dispatch made the US victory clear  When no second attack came  the defeat of the Shawnee was more certain  Eustis demanded to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against attacks  Harrison countered by saying he had considered the position strong enough  The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War that continued into the War of 1812     The press did not cover the battle at first  and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison s dispatch to Eustis to mean he was defeated    By December  as most major American papers carried stories on the battle  public outrage over the Shawnee attack grew  At a time of high tensions with the United Kingdom   many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms  In response  Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs  A few months later  the U S  declared war against UK     The outbreak of war with the British in 1812 led to continued conflict with Indians in the Old Northwest  and Harrison was kept in command of the army in Indiana  After the loss of Detroit   General James Winchester became the commander of the Army of the Northwest   He offered Harrison the rank of brigadier general   which he refused  as he wanted sole command of the army  President James Madison removed Winchester and made Harrison the commander on September 17  1812  Harrison inherited an army of fresh recruits  which he endeavored to drill  Initially  he was greatly outnumbered by the British with their Indian allies  In the winter of 181213  Harrison constructed a defensive position at the rapids on the Maumee River in northwest Ohio  He named it Fort Meigs in honor of the Ohio governor  Return J  Meigs  Jr   After receiving reinforcements in 1813  Harrison took the offensive  He led the army north to battle the Shawnee and their new British allies  He won victories in Indiana and Ohio  and recaptured Detroit  before invading Canada  He defeated the British at the Battle of the Thames   in which Tecumseh was killed    The Battle of the Thames was considered one of the great American victories in the war  second only to the Battle of New Orleans        Secretary of War John Armstrong divided the command of the army  assigning Harrison to a  backwater  post and giving control of the front to one of Harrison s subordinates  Armstrong and Harrison had disagreed over the lack of coordination and effectiveness in the invasion of Canada  When Harrison was reassigned  he promptly resigned from the army  His resignation was accepted in the summer of 1814     After the war ended  Congress investigated Harrison s resignation  It determined that he had been mistreated by the Secretary of War during his campaign and that his resignation was justified  They awarded Harrison a gold medal for his services during the War of 1812   Harrison returned to North Bend after he was replaced as Governor of Indiana Territory  and he returned his farm to cultivation and enlarged the log cabin farmhouse    In 1814  he was appointed by President Madison to serve as a commissioner to negotiate two treaties with the Indian tribes in the Northwest  Both treaties were advantageous to the United States  as the tribes ceded a large tract of land in the west  It provided more land for American purchase and settlement     Harrison was elected to the U S  House of Representatives to finish the term of John McLean of Ohio  serving from October 8  1816  to March 4  1819  He was elected to and served in the Ohio State Senate from 1819 to 1821  having lost the election for Ohio governor in 1820  In 1822  he ran for the U S  House  but lost by only 500 votes to James W  Gazlay   In 1824  he was elected to the U S  Senate  where he served until May 20  1828  Fellow westerners in Congress called Harrison a  Buckeye   a term of affection related to the native Ohio buckeye tree    He was an Ohio presidential elector in 1820 for James Monroe     and an Ohio presidential elector in 1824 for Henry Clay     In 1817  Harrison declined to serve as Secretary of War under President Monroe   Appointed as minister plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia   Harrison resigned from Congress and served in his new post until March 8  1829    He arrived in Bogot on December 22  1828  He found the condition of Colombia saddening  Harrison reported to the Secretary of State that the country was on the edge of anarchy and he thought Simn Bolvar was about to become a military dictator  While minister in Colombia  Harrison wrote a rebuke to Bolvar  stating     the strongest of all governments is that which is most free   He called on Bolvar to encourage the development of a democracy  In response  Bolvar wrote   The United States    seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom   a sentiment that achieved fame in Latin America    When the new administration of President Andrew Jackson took office in March 1829  Harrison was recalled so the new president could make his own appointment to the position  He returned to the United States in June     After Harrison returned to the United States in 1829  he settled on his farm in North Bend  Ohio   his adopted home state  There  he lived in relative retirement after nearly 40years of continuous government service  Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime  he subsisted on his savings  a small pension  and the income produced by his farm  Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey  After a brief time in the liquor business  he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers  and closed the distillery  In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831  Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey  and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors     In these early years  Harrison also earned money from his contributions to a biography written by James Hall  entitled A Memoir of the Public Services of William Henry Harrison   published in 1836  That year  he made an unsuccessful run for the presidency as a Whig candidate  Between 1836 and 1840  Harrison served as Clerk of Courts for Hamilton County   This was his job when he was elected president in 1840    By 1840  when Harrison campaigned for president a second time  more than 12 books had been published on his life  He was hailed by many as a national hero     Harrison was the Northern Whig candidate for president in 1836  one of only two times in American history when a major political party intentionally ran more than one presidential candidate  the Democrats ran two candidates in 1860   Vice President Martin Van Buren   the Democratic candidate  was popular and deemed likely to win the election against an individual Whig candidate  The Whig plan was to elect popular Whigs regionally  deny Van Buren the 148 electoral votes needed for election  and force the House of Representatives to decide the election  They hoped the Whigs would control the House after the general elections   This strategy would have failed  as the Democrats retained a majority in the House following the election        Harrison ran in all the free states except Massachusetts  and the slave states of Delaware  Maryland  and Kentucky  Hugh L  White ran in the remaining slave states except for South Carolina  Daniel Webster ran in Massachusetts  and Willie P  Mangum in South Carolina    The plan narrowly failed  as Van Buren won the election with 170 electoral votes  A swing of just over 4 000 votes in Pennsylvania would have given that state s 30 electoral votes to Harrison  and the election would have been decided in the House of Representatives         Harrison was the Whig candidate  and again faced Van Buren  now the incumbent president  in the 1840 election   The Whig party unified behind a single candidate  and Harrison was chosen over more controversial members of the party  such as Clay and Webster  Harrison based his campaign on his military record and on the weak U S  economy  caused by the Panic of 1837   In a ploy to blame Van Buren for the depressed economy  the Whigs nicknamed him  Van Ruin      The Democrats ridiculed Harrison by calling him  Granny Harrison  the petticoat general   because he resigned from the army before the War of 1812 ended  When asking voters whether Harrison should be elected  they asked them what his name backwards was  which happens to be  No Sirrah   Democrats cast Harrison as a provincial  out of touch old man who would rather   sit in his log cabin drinking hard cider   than attend to the administration of the country  This strategy backfired when Harrison and his vice presidential running mate  John Tyler   adopted the log cabin and hard cider as campaign symbols  They used the images in banners and posters  and created bottles of hard cider that were shaped like log cabins  all to connect to the  common man      Although Harrison had come from a wealthy  slaveholding Virginia family  in this campaign he was promoted as a humble frontiersman in the style of the popular Andrew Jackson  A memorable example was the Gold Spoon Oration   delivered by a Whig representative  Van Buren  by contrast  was presented as a wealthy elitist     A Whig chant from the time of the election exhibited the difference between candidates   Old Tip he wore a homespun coat  he had no ruffled shirt  wirt wirt  But Matt he has the golden plate  and he s a little squirt  wirt wirt   People singing the chant would spit tobacco juice while singing  wirt wirt      The Whigs boasted of Harrison s military record and reputation as the hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe  Their campaign slogan    Tippecanoe and Tyler  too    became among the most famous in American politics    On election day  Harrison won a landslide electoral college victory  though the popular vote was much closer  at 53  to 47      When Harrison came to Washington  he wanted to show both that he was still the steadfast hero of Tippecanoe  and that he was a more learned and thoughtful man than the backwoods caricature ascribed to him in the campaign  He took the oath of office on March 4  1841  a cold and wet day    He wore neither an overcoat nor hat  rode on horseback to the ceremony rather than in the closed carriage that had been offered him  and delivered the longest inaugural address in American history    At 8 445 words  it took him nearly two hours to read  although his friend and fellow Whig Daniel Webster had edited it for length  Harrison then rode through the streets in the inaugural parade    and that evening attended three inaugural balls    including one at Carusi s Saloon entitled the  Tippecanoe  ball  which at a price of US 10 per person  equal to  229 today  attracted 1000 guests   The inaugural address was a detailed statement of the Whig agenda  essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren s policies  Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency  Henry Clay s American system    to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters  with sparing use of his veto power  and to reverse Jackson s spoils system of executive patronage  He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff  not to enhance his own standing in government       As leader of the Whigs and a powerful legislator  as well as a frustrated presidential candidate in his own right   Clay expected to have substantial influence in the Harrison administration  He ignored his own platform plank of overturning the  spoils  system  Clay attempted to influence Harrison s actions before and during his brief presidency  especially in putting forth his own preferences for Cabinet offices and other presidential appointments  Harrison rebuffed his aggression  saying  Mr  Clay  you forget that I am the President     The dispute intensified when Harrison named Daniel Webster   Clay s arch rival  for control of the Whig Party  as his Secretary of State  and appeared to give Webster s supporters some highly coveted patronage positions  Harrison s sole concession to Clay was to name his protg John J  Crittenden to the post of Attorney General   Despite this  the dispute continued until the President s death   Clay was not the only one who hoped to benefit from Harrison s election  Hordes of office applicants came to the White House   which was then open to all comers who wanted a meeting with the President  Most of Harrison s business during his month long presidency involved extensive social obligationsan inevitable part of his high position and arrival in Washingtonand receiving visitors at the White House  They awaited him at all hours and filled the Executive Mansion    Harrison wrote in a letter dated March 10   I am so much harassed by the multitude that call upon me that I can give no proper attention to any business of my own     Nevertheless  Harrison sent a number of nominations for office to the Senate for confirmation during his month in office  The new 27th Congress had convened an extraordinary session for the purpose of confirming Harrison s cabinet and other important nominees  since a number of them arrived after Congress  March 15 adjournment  however  John Tyler would ultimately be forced to renominate many of Harrison s selections   Harrison took his pledge to reform executive appointments very seriously  visiting each of the six executive departments to observe its operations and issuing through Webster an order to all departments that electioneering by employees would henceforth be considered grounds for dismissal    As he had with Clay  Harrison resisted pressure from other Whigs over partisan patronage  When a group arrived in his office on March 16 to demand the removal of all Democrats from any appointed office  Harrison proclaimed   So help me God  I will resign my office before I can be guilty of such an iniquity     Harrison s own cabinet attempted to countermand the president s appointment of John Chambers as Governor of Iowa in favor of Webster s friend  General James Wilson   when Webster attempted to press this decision at a March 25 cabinet meeting  however  Harrison asked him to read aloud a handwritten note  which said simply  William Henry Harrison  President of the United States    then announced that  William Henry Harrison  President of the United States  tells you  gentlemen  that  by God  John Chambers shall be governor of Iowa      Harrison s only official act of consequence was to call Congress into a special session  Henry Clay and he had disagreed over the necessity of such a session  and when on March 11 Harrison s cabinet proved evenly divided  the president vetoed the idea  When Clay pressed Harrison on the special session on March 13  the president rebuffed his counsel and told him not to visit the White House again  but to address him only in writing    A few days later  however  Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing reported to Harrison that federal funds were in such trouble that the government could not continue to operate until Congress  regularly scheduled session in December  Harrison thus relented  and on March 17 proclaimed the special session in the interests of  the condition of the revenue and finance of the country   The session was scheduled to begin on May 31       On March 26  Harrison became ill with a cold   According to the prevailing medical misconception of that time  his illness was believed to be directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration  however  Harrison s illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event     The cold worsened  rapidly turning to pneumonia and pleurisy     He sought to rest in the White House  but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers  His extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce     Harrison s doctors tried cures  applying opium   castor oil   leeches   and Virginia snakeweed   but the treatments only made Harrison worse  and he became delirious  He died nine days after becoming ill    at 12 30am on April 4  1841  Harrison s doctor  Thomas Miller  diagnosed Harrison s cause of death as  pneumonia of the lower lobe of the right lung   but a 2014 medical analysis concluded that he instead died of enteric fever   The authors base their findings on the president s symptoms and the close proximity of the White House to a dumping ground for sewage and human waste       He was the first United States president to die in office  His last words were to his doctor  but assumed to be directed at John Tyler   Sir  I wish you to understand the true principles of the government  I wish them carried out  I ask nothing more   Harrison served the shortest term of any American president  March 4 April 4  1841  30 days  12 hours  and 30 minutes       Harrison s funeral took place in the Wesley Chapel in Cincinnati  Ohio  on April 7  1841    His original interment was in the public vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington  D C  He was later buried in North Bend  Ohio   The William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial was erected in his honor     Harrison s death was a disappointment to Whigs   who hoped to pass a revenue tariff and enact measures to support Henry Clay s American system  John Tyler   Harrison s successor and a former Democrat  abandoned the Whig agenda  effectively cutting himself off from the party     Due to the death of Harrison  three Presidents served within a single calendar year   Martin Van Buren   Harrison  Tyler   This has happened on only one other occasion  40 years later in 1881  when Rutherford B  Hayes was succeeded by James A  Garfield   who was assassinated later in that year  With the death of Garfield  Chester A  Arthur stepped into the presidency     Harrison s death revealed the flaws in the constitution s clauses on presidential succession    Article II of the Constitution states   In case of the removal of the President from office  or of his death  resignation  or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office  the same shall devolve on the Vice President    and  the Vice President  shall act accordingly  until the disability be removed  or a President shall be elected   Scholars at the time disagreed whether the vice president would become president or merely acting President  The Constitution did not stipulate whether the Vice President could serve the remainder of the President s term  until the next election  or if emergency elections should be held   Harrison s cabinet insisted that Tyler was  Vice President acting as President   After the cabinet consulted with the Chief Justice Roger Taney   they decided that if Tyler took the presidential Oath of Office   he would assume the office of President  Tyler obliged and was sworn in on April 6  In May  Congress convened  After a short period of debate in both houses  it passed a resolution that confirmed Tyler in the presidency for the remainder of Harrison s term  Once established  this precedent of presidential succession remained in effect until the Twenty fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967      Following the assassination of John F  Kennedy and the succession of Lyndon B  Johnson to the presidency in 1963  the Twenty fifth Amendment dealt with the finer points of succession  It defined in what situations the Vice President was acting President  and in what situation the Vice President could become President   Harrison was the first sitting President to have his photograph taken  on Inauguration Day in 1841  Photographs exist of John Quincy Adams   Andrew Jackson   and Martin van Buren   but those images were all taken after these men had ceased to be President  The Harrison image was also the first of these photographs to be taken  The original daguerreotype   made in Washington on his Inauguration Day  has been lostalthough at least one early photographic copy exists in the archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art      Harrison s chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods  which laid the foundation for the modern presidential campaign tactics    Harrison died nearly penniless  Congress voted to give his wife a Presidential widow s pension   a payment of  25 000    one year of Harrison s salary  This is equivalent to  571 532 today  She also received the right to mail letters free of charge     Harrison s son John Scott Harrison served in the U S  House of Representatives from Ohio between 1853 and 1857    Harrison s grandson  Benjamin Harrison of Indiana  was the 23rd president  from 1889 to 1893  making them the only grandparentgrandchild pair of Presidents     Numerous places were named after Harrison   Three schools were named William Henry Harrison High School  in Evansville and West Lafayette   Indiana and Harrison  Ohio   in his honor         During the American Civil War   the Union Army named a post near Cincinnati Camp Harrison      and a military fort in Montana was named for him    Because of his short service  no military vessel was named after him as President   A statue of Harrison was erected on Monument Circle in Indianapolis   Additionally  Harrison is shown  on the left  facing the building  in a pediment on the Tippecanoe County Courthouse   Lafayette  Indiana

was an American statesman who served as the sixth President of the United States from 1825 to 1829  He also served as a diplomat  a Senator and member of the House of Representatives  He was a member of the Federalist   Democratic Republican   National Republican   and later Anti Masonic and Whig parties    In his biography  Samuel Flagg Bemis argues that Adams was able to   gather together  formulate  and practice the fundamentals of American foreign policy  self determination  independence  noncolonization  nonintervention  nonentanglement in European politics  Freedom of the Seas   and  freedom of commerce      John Quincy Adams was the son of former President John Adams and Abigail Adams   As a diplomat  Adams played an important role in negotiating key treaties  most notably the Treaty of Ghent   which ended the War of 1812   As Secretary of State   he negotiated with Britain over the United States  northern border with Canada  negotiated with Spain the annexation of Florida   and drafted the Monroe Doctrine   Historians agree he was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history       As president he sought to modernize the American economy and promote education  Adams enacted a part of his agenda and paid off much of the national debt     However he was stymied time and again by a Congress controlled by his enemies  and his lack of patronage networks helped politicians eager to undercut him  He lost his 1828 bid for re election to Andrew Jackson    Adams is best known as a diplomat who shaped America s foreign policy in line with his ardently nationalist commitment to America s republican values   More recently  he has been portrayed as the exemplar and moral leader in an era of modernization  During Adams  lifetime  technological innovations and new means of communication spread messages of religious revival  social reform  and party politics  Goods  money  and people traveled more rapidly and efficiently than ever before     Adams was elected as U S  Representative from Massachusetts after leaving office  serving for the last 17 years of his life with far greater acclaim than he had achieved as president  Animated by his growing revulsion against slavery     Adams became a leading opponent of the Slave Power   He predicted that if a civil war were to break out  the president could abolish slavery by using his powers   Adams also predicted the Union s dissolution over the slavery issue  but said that if the South became independent there would be a series of bloody slave revolts       John Quincy Adams was born on July 11  1767  to John Adams and his wife Abigail Adams  ne Smith  in a part of Braintree  Massachusetts that is now Quincy     John Quincy Adams did not attend school  but was tutored by his cousin James Thax and his father s law clerk  Nathan Rice    He was named for his mother s maternal grandfather  Colonel John Quincy   after whom Quincy  Massachusetts   is named    His namesake great grandfather died only two days after he was born   Adams first learned of the Declaration of Independence from the letters his father wrote his mother from the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia   In 1779  Adams began a diary that he kept until just before he died in 1848    The massive fifty volumes are one of the most extensive collections of first hand information from the period of the early republic and are widely cited by modern historians     Much of Adams  youth was spent accompanying his father overseas  John Adams served as an American envoy to France from 1778 until 1779 and to the Netherlands from 1780 until 1782  and the younger Adams accompanied his father on these diplomatic missions    Adams acquired an education at institutions such as Leiden University   He matriculated in Leiden January 10  1781      For nearly three years  beginning at the age of 14  he accompanied Francis Dana as a secretary on a mission to Saint Petersburg   Russia   to obtain recognition of the new United States  He spent time in Finland   Sweden   and Denmark and  in 1804  published a travel report of Silesia     During these years overseas  Adams became fluent in French and Dutch and became familiar with German and other European languages  Adams  mainly through the influence of his father  had also excelled in classical studies and reached high fluency of Latin and Greek  Upon entering Harvard he had already translated Virgil  Horace  Plutarch  and Aristotle    He entered Harvard College and was graduated in 1787 with a Bachelor of Arts degree  Phi Beta Kappa     Adams House at Harvard College is named in honor of Adams and his father  He later earned an M A  from Harvard in 1790    He apprenticed as an attorney with Theophilus Parsons in Newburyport  Massachusetts   from 1787 to 1789  He gained admittance to the bar in 1791 and began practicing law in Boston      Adams first won national recognition when he published a series of widely read articles supporting Washington s decision to keep America out of the growing hostilities surrounding the French Revolution   Soon after  George Washington appointed Adams minister to the Netherlands  at the age of 26  in 1793  He did not want the position  preferring to maintain his quiet life of reading in Massachusetts  and probably would have rejected it if his father had not persuaded him to take it  On his way to the Netherlands  he was to deliver a set of documents to John Jay   who was negotiating the Jay Treaty   After spending some time with Jay  Adams wrote home to his father  in support of the emerging treaty because he thought America should stay out of European affairs  Historian Paul Nagel has noted that this letter reached Washington  and that parts of it were used by Washington when drafting his farewell address      While going back and forth between The Hague and London  he met and proposed to his future wife  Louisa Catherine Johnson   Though he wanted to return to private life at the end of his appointment  Washington appointed him minister to Portugal in 1796  where he was soon appointed to the Berlin Legation  Though his talents were far greater than his desire to serve  he was finally convinced to remain in public service when he learned how highly Washington thought of his abilities     Washington called Adams  the most valuable of America s officials abroad   and Nagel believes that it was at this time that Adams first came to terms with a lifetime of public service     He became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1797    When the elder Adams became president  he appointed his son in 1797 as Minister to Prussia at Washington s urging  There Adams signed the renewal of the very liberal Prussian American Treaty of Amity and Commerce after negotiations with Prussian Foreign Minister Count Karl Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein   He served at that post until 1801   While serving abroad  in 1797 Adams also married Louisa Catherine Johnson  the daughter of a poor American merchant  in a ceremony at the church of All Hallows by the Tower   London   Adams remains the only president to have married a First Lady born outside of the United States   On his return to the United States  Adams was appointed a Commissioner of Monetary Affairs in Boston by a Federal District Judge  however  Thomas Jefferson rescinded this appointment  He again tried his hand as an attorney  but shortly afterward entered politics  John Quincy Adams was elected a member of the Massachusetts State Senate in April 1802  In November 1802 he ran as a Federalist for the United States House of Representatives and lost     The Massachusetts General Court elected Adams as a Federalist to the U S  Senate soon after  and he served from March 4  1803  until 1808  when he broke with the Federalist Party  Adams  as a senator  had supported the Louisiana Purchase and Jefferson s Embargo Act  actions which made him very unpopular with Massachusetts Federalists  The Federalist controlled Massachusetts Legislature chose a replacement for Adams on June 3  1808  several months early  On June 8  Adams broke with the Federalists  resigned his Senate seat  and became a Republican     While a member of the Senate  Adams also served as a professor of logic at Brown University     Disowned by the Federalists and not fully accepted by the Republicans   Adams used his Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard as a new base    Adams  devotion to classical rhetoric shaped his response to public issues  He remained inspired by classical rhetorical ideals long after the neo classicalism and deferential politics of the founding generation had been eclipsed by the commercial ethos and mass democracy of the Jacksonian Era  Many of Adams  idiosyncratic positions were rooted in his abiding devotion to the Ciceronian ideal of the citizen orator  speaking well  to promote the welfare of the polis    Adams was influenced by the classical republican ideal of civic eloquence espoused by British philosopher David Hume     Adams adapted these classical republican ideals of public oratory to America  viewing the multilevel political structure as ripe for  the renaissance of Demosthenic eloquence   Adams  Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory  1810  looks at the fate of ancient oratory  the necessity of liberty for it to flourish  and its importance as a unifying element for a new nation of diverse cultures and beliefs  Just as civic eloquence failed to gain popularity in Britain  in the United States interest faded in the second decade of the 19th century as the  public spheres of heated oratory  disappeared in favor of the private sphere     President James Madison appointed Adams as the first ever United States Minister to Russia in 1809  though Francis Dana and William Short had previously been nominated to the post  neither presented his credentials at Saint Petersburg    After resigning his post at Harvard  Adams and his wife Louisa boarded a merchant ship in Boston on Aug  5  1809  Their youngest son was with them during the long and tedious voyage to St  Petersburg  Their voyage was temporarily interrupted outside the southern coast of Norway   due to the Gunboat War   They were at first boarded by a British officer who examined their papers and then  later that day  by a Norwegian officer who ordered the ship to Christiansand   In Christiansand  Adams discovered thirty eight U S  vessels which had been detained by the Norwegians and decided to take whatever action necessary to gain the release of both ships and crew as soon as possible  Norway was under Danish rule at the time  so the officer and pirates were actually Norwegian   The voyage to St  Petersburg resumed but was once again stopped by a British squadron  Adams showed his commission to Admiral Albermarle Bertie   the commander of the Squadron who recognized the usage of nations and Adams as an ambassador  The usage of nations is common laws of nations founded on custom  Because of the many delays  the Adams  did not arrive in St  Petersburg until October 23  1809   Count Nikolay Rumyantsev   Chancellor of the empire  formally received Adams  and requested a copy of his credential letter  Romanzoff assured Adams that his appointment pleased him personally  Adams presentation to the emperor was postponed however because of the temporary indisposition of Alexander I   Rumyantsev immediately invited Adams to a diplomatic dinner which included the French ambassador  Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt   Duke of Vicenza  numerous foreign ministers then at the Russian Court  and many of the nobility  This was the same mansion Adams had dined in 1781  as secretary of Francis Dana   Tsar Alexander I received Adams alone in his cabinet where he expressed his pleasure at Adams  appointment  Adams told Alexander that  the President of the United States had desired him to express the hope that his mission would be considered as a proof of respect for the person and character of his majesty  as an acknowledgment of the many testimonies of good will he had already given to the United States  and of a desire to strengthen commercial relations between them and his provinces   Alexander replied  that   in everything depending on him  he should be happy to contribute to the increase of their friendly relations  that it was his wish to establish a just system of maritime rights  and that he should adhere invariably to those he had declared     After these official diplomatic greetings  Alexander and Adams discussed several other issues such as the policies of the different European powers  trade and commerce  and other mutually beneficial prospects  and that the Russian and U S  could be very useful to each other   Adams was also given private audiences with the empress and the dowager empress  who also received Louisa Adams  While not officially a diplomat  Louisa Adams did serve an invaluable role as wife of diplomat  becoming a favorite of the czar and making up for her husband s utter lack of charm  She was an indispensable part of the American mission     Adams requested Rumyantsev to ask Alexander to act on behalf of the United States in securing the release of the American sailors and ships being held by the Danish  The Tsar ordered the Chancellor to request the release of the American property as soon as possible  which the Danish government complied with  Adams spent a great deal of time securing the release of American vessels and seamen from various  seizures and sequestrations    In 1811  Adams received a commission from the Secretary of State as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States  Adams immediately declined and remained in St  Petersburg  In 1812  Adams reported the news of Napoleon s invasion of Russia and Napoleon s disastrous retreat  Also in 1812  Rumyantsev asked if he should request Alexander to mediate a pacification of hostilities between the United States and Great Britain  The U S  accepted the offer and in July 1813  two associates of Adams  Albert Gallatin and James A  Bayard arrived in St  Petersburg to begin negotiations under mediation by Alexander  Gallatin was at that time Secretary of Treasury and the Senate rejected his appointment to the diplomatic mission as incompatible under the Constitution  However  this rejection did not occur until after Gallatin and Bayard had already left for St  Petersburg  In September  Lord William Cathcart delivered a British memoir to Alexander explaining their reasons for declining the mediation  Thus ended President Madison s hope that Alexander could end the war     Adams was well liked by the Russian Court and often would be met on walks by Alexander  The tsar asked Adams if he would be taking a house in the country over the summer  When Adams hesitated  the emperor stated with good humor that perhaps it was a financial consideration and Adams was able to respond in kind that it was in large part  Adams was a man who endeavored to live within the means provided by the American government     The Adams  were also provided with several invitations to various entertainments   The formalities of these court presentations   Mr  Adams remarked   are so trifling and insignificant in themselves  and so important in the eyes of princes and courtiers  that they are much more embarrassing to an American than business of greater importance  It is not safe or prudent to despise them  nor practicable for a person of rational understanding to value them     Adams was concerned that the various balls and parties given by the Tsar and the foreign ministers  took too much time away from his official duties  Often these events would last until 4 a m   so Adams stopped attending those he was able to avoid  The numerous diplomatic visits also annoyed Adams who wrote  I have been engaged the whole forenoon  and though I rise at six o clock  I am sometimes unable to find time to write only part of a private letter in the course of the day  These visits take up so much of my time  that I sometimes think of taking a resolution not to receive them  but  on the other hand  so much information important to be possessed  and particularly relative to current political events  is to be collected from them  that they are rather to be encouraged than discountenanced    In 1814  Adams was recalled from Russia to serve as chief negotiator of the U S  commission for the Treaty of Ghent   which ended the War of 1812 between the United States and United Kingdom   Finally  he was sent to be minister to the Court of St  James s   Britain   from 1815 until 1817  a post that was first held by his father    The name is derived from its location at St  James s Palace   In London  Adams was part of a U S  Legation consisting of himself  two young secretaries and a small office in Craven Street  London WC2    Since they were not particularly well paid  Adams and his wife Louisa lived in Ealing   at that time a village in the countryside  in order to maintain the expensive carriages and liveries which social appearance demanded     Adams served as Secretary of State in the Cabinet of President James Monroe from 1817 until 1825  Typically  his views concurred with those espoused by Monroe  As Secretary of State  he negotiated the AdamsOns Treaty  which acquired Florida for the United States   the Treaty of 1818   and wrote the Monroe Doctrine   Many historians regard him as one of the greatest Secretaries of State in American history       The Floridas  still a Spanish territory but with no Spanish presence to speak of  became a refuge for runaway slaves and native Americans  Monroe sent in General Andrew Jackson who pushed the Seminole south  executed two British merchants who were supplying weapons  deposed one governor and named another  and left an American garrison in occupation    President Monroe and all his cabinet  except Adams  believed Jackson had exceeded his instructions  Adams argued that since Spain had proved incapable of policing her territories  the United States was obliged to act in self defense  Adams so ably justified Jackson s conduct that he silenced protests from either Spain or Britain  Congress refused to punish Jackson  Adams used the events that had unfolded in Florida to negotiate the Florida Treaty with Spain in 1819 that turned Florida over to the U S  and resolved border issues regarding the Louisiana Purchase     With the ongoing Oregon boundary dispute   Adams sought to negotiate a settlement with England to decide the border between the western United States and Canada  This would become the Treaty of 1818   Along with the RushBagot Treaty of 1817  this marked the beginning of improved relations between the British Empire and its former colonies  and paved the way for better relations between the U S  and Canada   The treaty had several provisions  but in particular it set the boundary between British North America and the United States along the 49th parallel through the Rocky Mountains   This settled a boundary dispute caused by ignorance of actual geography in the boundary agreed to in the 1783 Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolutionary War   That earlier treaty had used the Mississippi River to determine the border  but assumed that the river extended further north than it did  and so that earlier settlement was unworkable   By the time Monroe became president  several European powers  in particular Spain  were attempting to re establish control over South America    On Independence Day 1821  in response to those who advocated American support for independence movements in many South American countries    Adams gave a speech in which he said that American policy was moral support for independence movements but not armed intervention  Adams foresaw what would befall the United States if it sacrificed its republican spirit on the altar of empire  He stated that America  goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy  lest she  involve herself beyond power of extrication  in all wars of interest and intrigue  of individual avarice  envy  and ambition  which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom  The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force   The United States  Adams warned  might  become the dictatress of the world  but  she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit     From this  Adams authored what came to be known as the Monroe Doctrine  which was introduced on December 2  1823  It stated that further efforts by European countries to colonize land or interfere with states in the Americas would be viewed as acts of aggression requiring U S  intervention    The United States  reflecting concerns raised by Great Britain  ultimately hoped to avoid having any European power take over Spain s colonies    It became a defining moment in the foreign policy of the United States and one of its longest standing tenets  and would be invoked by many U S  statesmen and several U S  presidents  including Theodore Roosevelt   Calvin Coolidge   Herbert Hoover   John F  Kennedy   Ronald Reagan and others   As the 1824 election drew near people began looking for candidates  New England voters admired Adams  patriotism and political skills and it was mainly due to their support that he entered the race  The old caucus system of the Democratic Republican Party had collapsed  indeed the entire First Party System had collapsed and the election was a fight based on regional support  Adams had a strong base in New England  His opponents included John C  Calhoun   William H  Crawford   Henry Clay   and the hero of New Orleans  Andrew Jackson   During the campaign Calhoun dropped out  and Crawford fell ill giving further support to the other candidates  When Election Day arrived  Andrew Jackson won  although narrowly  pluralities of the popular and electoral votes  but not the necessary majority of electoral votes    With just over one fourth voter turnout for the election  combined with Adams receiving less than one third of the popular vote  Adams scored only 113 142 votes   Under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment   the presidential election fell to the House of Representatives  which was to choose from the top three candidates  Jackson  Adams  and Crawford  Clay had come in fourth place and thus was not on the ballot  but he retained considerable power and influence as Speaker of the House   Clay s personal dislike for Jackson and the similarity of his American System to Adams  position on tariffs and internal improvements caused him to throw his support to Adams  who was elected by the House on February 9  1825  on the first ballot  Adams  victory shocked Jackson  who had won the most electoral and popular votes and fully expected to be elected president  When Adams appointed Clay as Secretary of Statethe position that Adams and his three predecessors had held before becoming president Jacksonian Democrats were outraged  and claimed that Adams and Clay had struck a   corrupt bargain    This contention overshadowed Adams  term and greatly contributed to Adams  loss to Jackson four years later  in the 1828 election      Adams served as the sixth President of the United States from March 4  1825  to March 4  1829  He took the oath of office on a book of constitutional law   instead of the more traditional Bible   Adams proposed an elaborate program of internal improvements  roads  ports and canals   a national university  and federal support for the arts and sciences  He favored a high tariff to encourage the building of factories  and restricted land sales to slow the movement west  Opposition from the states  rights faction of a hostile congress killed many of his proposals    He also reduced the national debt from  16 million to  5 million  the remainder of which was paid off by his immediate successor  Andrew Jackson      Paul Nagel argues that his political acumen was not any less developed than others were in his day  and notes that Henry Clay   one of the era s most astute politicians  was a principal adviser to Adams and supporter throughout his presidency  Nagel argues that Adams  political problems were the result of an unusually hostile Jacksonian faction  and Adams  own dislike of the office    Although a product of the political culture of his day  he refused to play politics according to the usual rules and was not as aggressive in courting political support as he could have been  He was attacked by the followers of Jackson   who accused him of being a partner to a   corrupt bargain   to obtain Clay s support in the election and then appoint him Secretary of State     Jackson defeated Adams in 1828  and created the modern Democratic party thus inaugurating the Second Party System      During his term  Adams worked on transforming America into a world power through   internal improvements    as a part of the   American System    It consisted of a high tariff to support internal improvements such as road building  and a national bank to encourage productive enterprise and form a national currency  In his first annual message to Congress  Adams presented an ambitious program for modernization that included roads  canals  a national university    an astronomical observatory    and other initiatives  The support for his proposals was mixed  mainly due to opposition from Jackson s followers     Some of his proposals were adopted  specifically the extension of the Cumberland Road into Ohio with surveys for its continuation west to St  Louis   the beginning of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal   the construction of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and the Louisville and Portland Canal around the falls of the Ohio   the connection of the Great Lakes to the Ohio River system in Ohio and Indiana  and the enlargement and rebuilding of the Dismal Swamp Canal in North Carolina     One of the issues which divided the administration was protective tariffs  of which Henry Clay was a leading advocate  After Adams lost control of Congress in 1827  the situation became more complicated  By signing into law the Tariff of 1828   quite unpopular in parts of the south  he further antagonized the Jacksonians     Adams  generous policy toward Native Americans caused him trouble  Settlers on the frontier  who were constantly seeking to move westward  cried for a more expansionist policy  When the federal government tried to assert authority on behalf of the Cherokees  the governor of Georgia took up arms  Adams defended his domestic agenda as continuing Monroe s policies  In contrast  Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren instigated the policy of Indian removal to the west  i e  the Trail of Tears       Adams is regarded as one of the greatest diplomats in American history  and during his tenure as Secretary of State   he was the chief designer of the Monroe Doctrine     He had witnessed the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War against the Arab pirates of North Africa  and the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Turks  Public opinion in the U S  strongly favored the Greek cause and such leaders as Henry Clay called for intervention  Adams strongly opposed any entanglement in European affairs    According to Charles Edel  Adams believed that   Intervention would accomplish little  retard the cause of republicanism  and distract the country from its primary goal of continental expansion   Moreover  fearful that U S  intentions would outstrip its capabilities  Adams thought that projecting U S  power abroad would weaken its gravitational force on the North American continent     On July 4  1821  he gave an address to Congress       But she  the United States of America  goes not abroad  in search of monsters to destroy  She is the well wisher to the freedom and independence of all  She is the champion and vindicator only of her own     During his term as president  however  Adams achieved little of long term consequence in foreign affairs  A reason for this was the opposition he faced in Congress  where his rivals prevented him from succeeding    Among his diplomatic achievements were treaties of reciprocity with a number of nations  including Denmark   Mexico   the Hanseatic League   the Scandinavian countries  Prussia and Austria   However  thanks to the successes of Adams  diplomacy during his previous eight years as secretary of state  most of the foreign policy issues he would have faced had been resolved by the time he became president     John Quincy Adams left office on March 4  1829  after losing the election of 1828 to Andrew Jackson   Adams did not attend the inauguration of his successor  Andrew Jackson  who had openly snubbed him by refusing to pay the traditional  courtesy call  to the outgoing president during the weeks before his own inauguration    He was one of only four presidents who chose not to attend their respective successor s inauguration  the others were his father   Andrew Johnson   and Richard Nixon   After the inauguration of Adams in 1825  Jackson resigned from his senate seat  For four years he worked hard  with help from his supporters in Congress  to defeat Adams in the presidential election of 1828   The campaign was very much a personal one  As was the tradition of the day and age in American presidential politics  neither candidate personally campaigned  but their political followers organized many campaign events  Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press  This reached a low point when the press accused Jackson s wife Rachel of bigamy  She died a few weeks after the elections  Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him  but he would never forgive the ones who had attacked his wife   Adams lost the election by a decisive margin  He won all the same states that his father had won in the election of 1800   the New England states  New Jersey   and Delaware   as well as parts of New York and a majority of Maryland  Jackson won the rest of the states  picking up 178 electoral votes to Adams  83 votes  and succeeded him  Adams and his father were the only U S  presidents to serve a single term during the first 48 years of the Presidency  17891837   Historian Thomas Bailey observed   Seldom has the public mind been so successfully poisoned against an honest and high minded man      Adams did not retire after leaving office  Instead he ran for and won a seat in the United States House of Representatives in the 1830 elections   This went against the generally held opinion that former Presidents should not run for public office  He was the first President to serve in Congress after his term of office  and one of only two former presidents to do so   Andrew Johnson later served in the Senate    He was elected to nine terms  serving as a Representative for 17 years  from 1831 until his death   Adams ran for Governor of Massachusetts in 1833 on the Anti Masonic ticket    Incumbent National Republican Governor Levi Lincoln Jr  was retiring and Adams faced National Republican John Davis   Democrat Marcus Morton and Samuel L  Allen of the Working Men s Party   Davis won a plurality  40   and Adams took 29  with Morton taking 25  and Allen 6   Because no candidate had won a majority  the election was sent to the state legislature to decide  Adams withdrew and endorsed Davis  preferring him over Morton  and Davis was chosen by the legislature in January 1834   In authoring a change to the Tariff of 1828   he was instrumental to the compromise that ended the Nullification Crisis   When James Smithson died and left his estate to the U S  government to build an institution of learning  many in Congress wanted to use the money for other purposes  Adams was key to ensuring that the money was instead used to build the Smithsonian Institution      In Congress  he was chair of the Committee on Commerce and Manufactures   the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs      A longtime opponent of slavery  Adams used his new role in Congress to fight it  In 1836  Southern Representatives voted in a   gag rule   that immediately tabled any petitions about slavery  thus preventing any discussion or debate of the slavery issue  He became a forceful opponent of this rule and conceived a way around it  attacking slavery in the House for two weeks     The gag rule prevented him from bringing slavery petitions to the floor  but he brought one anyway  It was a petition from a Georgia citizen urging disunion due to the continuation of slavery in the South  Though he certainly did not support it and made that clear at the time  his intent was to antagonize the pro slavery faction of Congress into an open fight on the matter    The plan worked   The petition infuriated his Congressional enemies  many of whom were agitating for disunion themselves  They moved for his censure over the matter  enabling Adams to discuss slavery openly during his subsequent defense  Taking advantage of his right to defend himself  Adams delivered prepared and impromptu remarks against slavery and in favor of abolition    Knowing that he would probably be acquitted  he changed the focus from his own actions to those of the slaveholders  speaking against the slave trade and the ownership of slaves    He decided that if he were censured  he would merely resign  run for the office again  and probably win easily    When his opponents realized that they played into his political strategy  they tried to bury the censure  Adams made sure this did not happen  and the debate continued  He attacked slavery and slaveholders as immoral and condemned the institution while calling for it to end    After two weeks  a vote was held  and he was not censured  He delighted in the misery he was inflicting on the slaveholders he so hated  and prided himself on being  obnoxious to the slave faction      Although the censure of Adams over the slavery petition was ultimately abandoned  the House did address the issue of petitions from enslaved persons at a later time  Adams again argued that the right to petition was a universal right  granted by God  so that those in the weakest positions might always have recourse to those in the most powerful  Adams also called into question the actions of a House that would limit its own ability to debate and resolve questions internally  After this debate  the gag rule was ultimately retained     The discussion ignited by his actions and the attempts of others to quiet him raised questions of the right to petition  the right to legislative debate  and the morality of slavery    During the censure debate  Adams said that he took delight in the fact that southerners would forever remember him as  the acutest  the astutest  the archest enemy of southern slavery that ever existed      In 1844  he chaired a committee for reform of the rules of Congress  and he used this opportunity to try once again to repeal the gag rule  He spent two months building support for this move  but due to northern opposition  the rule narrowly survived    He fiercely criticized northern Representatives and Senators  in particular Stephen A  Douglas   who seemed to cater to the slave faction in exchange for southern support    His opposition to slavery made him  along with Henry Clay   one of the leading opponents of Texas annexation and the MexicanAmerican War   He correctly predicted that both would contribute to civil war     After one of his reelection victories  he said that he must  bring about a day prophesied when slavery and war shall be banished from the face of the earth     He wrote in his private journal in 1820     The discussion of this Missouri question has betrayed the secret of their souls  In the abstract they admit that slavery is an evil  they disclaim it  and cast it all upon the shoulder ofGreat Britain  But when probed to the quick upon it  they show at the bottom of their souls pride and vainglory in their condition of masterdom  They look down upon the simplicity of a Yankees manners  because he has no habits of overbearing like theirs and cannot treat negroes like dogs  It is among the evils of slavery that it taints the very sources of moral principle  It establishes false estimates of virtue and vice  for what can be more false and heartless than this doctrine which makes the first and holiest rights of humanity to depend upon the color of the skin   In 1841  at the request of Lewis Tappan and Ellis Gray   Adams joined the case of United States v  The Amistad   Adams went before the Supreme Court on behalf of African slaves who had revolted and seized the Spanish ship Amistad   Adams appeared on 24 February 1841  and spoke for four hours  His argument succeeded  the Court ruled in favor of the Africans  who were declared free and returned to their homes     In 1843  Adams sat for the earliest confirmed photograph still in existence of a U S  president  although other sources contend that William Henry Harrison had posed even earlier for his portrait  in 1841    The original daguerreotype is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution      Although there is no indication that the two were close  Adams met Abraham Lincoln during the latter s sole term as a member of the House of Representatives  from 1847 until Adams  death    Thus  it has been suggested that Adams is the only major figure in American history who knew both the Founding Fathers and Abraham Lincoln  though Martin Van Buren met Founding Fathers Thomas Jefferson and John Adams   knew Founder Aaron Burr  Van Buren s mentor   and met the young Lincoln while on a campaign trip through Illinois     Besides his opposition to slavery and the gag rule  discussed above   his congressional career is remembered for several other key accomplishments  Shortly after Adams entered Congress  the Nullification Crisis threatened civil war over the Tariff of 1828   Adams authored an alteration to the tariff  which weakened it and diffused the crisis  Congress also passed the Force Bill which authorized President Andrew Jackson to use military force if Adams  compromise bill did not force the belligerent states to capitulate  There was no need  however  because Adams  compromise defused the issue  The compromise actually did not alter the tariff as much as the southern states had hoped  though they agreed not to continue pursuing the issue for fear of civil war     Adams also became a leading force for the advancement of science  As president  he had proposed a national observatory  which did not win much support  In 1829 British scientist James Smithson died  and left his fortune for the  increase and diffusion of knowledge   In Smithson s will  he stated that should his nephew  Henry James Hungerford  die without heirs  the Smithson estate would go to the government of the United States to create an  Establishment for the increase   diffusion of Knowledge among men   After the nephew died without heirs in 1835  President Andrew Jackson informed Congress of the bequest  which amounted to about US  500 000   75 000 000 in 2008 U S  dollars after inflation   Adams realized that this might allow the United States to realize his dream of building a national institution of science and learning  Adams thus became Congress  primary supporter of what would become the Smithsonian Institution   He also relentlessly pursued support for astronomical efforts and observatories  seeking a national observatory for the United States      His efforts eventually led to what is now the United States  oldest  still operational scientific institution  the United States Naval Observatory   In 1825 Adams signed a bill for the creation of a national observatory just before leaving presidential office  which became the Naval Observatory  Adams in fact spent many nights at the Observatory  with celebrated national astronomer and oceanographer Matthew Fontaine Maury   watching and charting the stars  which had always been one of Adams  avocations   As for efforts to found the Smithsonian Institution   the money was invested in shaky state bonds  which quickly defaulted  After heated debate in Congress  Adams successfully argued to restore the lost funds with interest    Though Congress wanted to use the money for other purposes  Adams successfully persuaded Congress to preserve the money for an institution of science and learning    Congress also debated whether the federal government had the authority to accept the gift  though with Adams leading the initiative  Congress decided to accept the legacy bequeathed to the nation and pledged the faith of the United States to the charitable trust on July 1  1836     In 1846  the 78 year old former president suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed  After a few months of rest  he made a full recovery and resumed his duties in Congress  When Adams entered the House chamber  everyone  stood up and applauded     On February 21  1848  the House of Representatives was discussing the matter of honoring U S  Army officers who served in the MexicanAmerican War   Adams had been a vehement critic of the war  and as Congressmen rose up to say   Aye   in favor of the measure  he instead yelled   No     He rose to answer a question put forth by the Speaker of the House    Immediately thereafter  Adams collapsed  having suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage     Two days later  on February 23  he died with his wife and youngest son at his side in the Speaker s Room inside the Capitol Building in Washington  D C  His last words were  This is the last of earth  I am content   He died at 7 20p m     His original interment was temporary  in the public vault at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington  D C  Later  he was interred in the family burial ground in Quincy  Massachusetts  across from the First Parish Church  called Hancock Cemetery   After Louisa s death in 1852  his son Charles Francis Adams had his parents reinterred in the expanded family crypt in the United First Parish Church across the street  next to John and Abigail  Both tombs are viewable by the public  Adams  original tomb at Hancock Cemetery is still there and marked simply  J Q  Adams      John Quincy Adams and Louisa Catherine Adams had three sons and a daughter  Their daughter  Louisa  was born in 1811 but died in 1812 while the family was in Russia  They named their first son George Washington Adams  18011829  after the first president  Both George and their second son  John  18031834   led troubled lives and died in early adulthood       George committed suicide and John was expelled from Harvard before his 1823 graduation    Adams  youngest son  Charles Francis Adams  who named his own son John Quincy    also pursued a career in diplomacy and politics  In 1870 Charles Francis built the first memorial presidential library in the United States  to honor his father  The Stone Library includes over 14 000 books written in twelve languages  The library is located in the   Old House   at Adams National Historical Park in Quincy  Massachusetts    John Adams and John Quincy Adams were the only father and son to serve as presidents until George H  W  Bush  19891993  and George W  Bush  20012009    Adams has been determined to have the highest I Q  of any U S  President       John Quincy Adams Birthplace is now part of Adams National Historical Park and open to the public  The name Quincy has been used for at least nineteen other places in the United States  Those places were either directly or indirectly named for John Quincy Adams  for example  Quincy  Illinois   was named in honor of Adams while Quincy  California   was named for Quincy  Illinois    Adams was the first president to have his photograph taken    He also became the first president to adopt a short haircut instead of long hair tied in a queue and to regularly wear long trousers instead of knee breeches   He is probably best known as a diplomat who shaped America s foreign policy in accordance with his ardently nationalist views  and is widely considered by historians to have been one of the greatest diplomats in American history    He was key to the negotiation of several important treaties  such as the Treaty of Ghent  which ended the War of 1812   and the Florida Treaty  which resulted in the annexation of Florida   He also formulated the Monroe Doctrine   which is still evoked to the present day  He is viewed by many as the exemplar and moral leader in an era of modernization  During this era  new technologies and networks of infrastructure and communication brought to the people messages of religious revival  social reform  and party politics  as well as moving goods  money  and people ever more rapidly and efficiently     Though he was always quite hostile to slavery  nearly to be point of being an abolitionist  although he doubted the abolitionists could successfully end slavery   he grew even more hostile to it later in life    Adams became a leading opponent of slave power and articulated a theory whereby the president could abolish slavery by using his war powers   a correct prediction of Abraham Lincoln  s use of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863  Adams predicted the likelihood of the Union s dissolution over the slavery issue  and was a key opponent of the MexicanAmerican War for this reason    Though he later described his presidency as the unhappiest time of his life    scholars rate John Quincy Adams in the second quartile in the majority of historical presidential rankings    Historians have often included Adams among the leading conservatives of his day            Russell Kirk   however  sees Adams as a flawed conservative who was imprudent in opposing slavery     One of Adams  most important legacies is his massive diary    which he began at age 11 with the simple entry  A journal  by me  J Q A   The Diary  housed at the Massachusetts Historical Society   covers  in extraordinary detail  Adams  life and experiences up to his death in 1848    The massive fifty volumes are one of the most extensive collections of first hand information from that period of the early American republic  and are cited by historians in a wide range of matters pertaining to that period     Adams  personality was much like that of his father  as were his political beliefs    Throughout his life  he always preferred reading in seclusion to attending social engagements  and several times had to be pressured by others to remain in public service  Historian Paul Nagel argues that  like Abraham Lincoln after him  Adams suffered from depression for much of his life  Early in his life he sought some form of treatment  Adams thought his depression was due to the high expectations demanded of him by his father and mother  Throughout his life he felt inadequate and socially awkward because of his depression  and was constantly bothered by his physical appearance    He was closer to his father  whom he spent much of his early life with abroad  than he was to his mother  When he was younger and the American Revolution was going on  his mother told her children what their father was doing  and what he was risking  and because of this Adams grew to greatly respect his father    His relationship with his mother was rocky  she had high expectations of him and was afraid her children might end up a dead alcoholic like her brother    As Abigail Adams had feared  John Quincy s brother  Charles  would eventually follow this fate   John Quincy fell in love shortly after he finished school  but his mother did not approve of his considering marriage when he was still dependent on his parents for support  and the relationship ended  When he fell in love with his future wife  Louisa Johnson   his mother disapproved of this relationship as well  His biographer  Nagel  concludes that this disapproval motivated him to marry Johnson in 1797  despite Adams  reservations that Johnson  like his mother  had a strong a personality     Marquis de Lafayette once gave Adams an alligator as a gift  which he lodged for months in the unfinished East Room of the White House  before building it its own lodge  Reports indicate he enjoyed showing it to visitors       Before 1820  Adams was best known as an exponent of American nationalism  Later in life  especially after his election to the House  he was famous as the most prominent national leader opposing slavery  He was not an abolitionist  say biographers Nagel and Parsons      Remini notes that Adams thought the end of slavery would come by either civil war or the consent of the slave South  but definitely not through the work of abolitionists     The turning point came with the debate on the Missouri Compromise in 1820 when he broke with his friend John C  Calhoun   who became the most outspoken national leader in favor of slavery  They became bitter enemies  Adams vilified slavery as a terrible evil and preached total abolition  while Calhoun countered that the right to own slaves had to be protected from interference from the federal government to keep the nation alive  Adams said slavery contradicted the principles of republicanism   while Calhoun said that slavery was essential to American democracy  for it made all white men equal  Both men pulled away from nationalism  and started to consider dissolution of the Union as a way of resolving the slavery predicament  Adams predicted that if the South formed a new nation  it would be torn apart by an extremely violent slave insurrection  If the two nations went to war  Adams predicted the president of the United States would use his war powers to abolish slavery  The two men became ideological leaders of the North and the South    In the House Adams became a champion of free speech  demanding that petitions against slavery be heard despite a  gag rule  that said they could not be heard     In 1841  Adams had the case of a lifetime  representing the defendants in United States v  The Amistad Africans in the Supreme Court of the United States   He successfully argued that the Africans  who had seized control of a Spanish ship on which they were being transported illegally as slaves  should not be extradited or deported to Cuba  a Spanish colony where slavery was legal  but should be considered free  Under President Martin Van Buren   the government argued the Africans should be deported for having mutinied and killed officers on the ship  Adams won their freedom  with the chance to stay in the United States or return to Africa  Adams made the argument because the U S  had prohibited the international slave trade  although it allowed internal slavery  He never billed for his services in the Amistad case    The speech was directed not only at the justices of this Supreme Court hearing the case  but also to the broad national audience he instructed in the evils of slavery     Adams repeatedly spoke out against the   Slave Power    that is the organized political power of the slave owners who dominated all the southern states and their representation in Congress    He vehemently attacked the annexation of Texas  1845  and the Mexican War  184648  as part of a  conspiracy  to extend slavery     Adams occasionally is featured in the mass media  In the PBS miniseries The Adams Chronicles  1976   he was portrayed by David Birney   William Daniels   Marcel Trenchard  Steven Grover and Mark Winkworth  He was also portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in the 1997 film Amistad   and again by Ebon Moss Bachrach and Steven Hinkle in the 2008 HBO television miniseries John Adams   the HBO series received criticism for needless historical and temporal distortions in its portrayal     ", "Obama": "Early life and career Community organizer and Harvard Law School University of Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney Legislative career 2C

he was black as pitch  my mother white as milkbarely registered in my mind     He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage    Reflecting later on his years in Honolulu  Obama wrote   The opportunity that Hawaii offeredto experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respectbecame an integral part of my world view  and a basis

reelection as president  Obama said his views had evolved  and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same sex marriage  becoming the first sitting U S  president to do so       During his second inaugural address on January 21  2013    Obama called for full equality for gay Americans   Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the lawfor if we are truly created equal  then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well   This was a historic moment  being the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word  gay  in an inaugural address      In 2013  the Obama administration filed briefs urging the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v

S  government a temporary 60percent equity stake in the company  with the Canadian government taking a 12percent stake    In June 2009  dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus  Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment    He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System   known colloquially as  Cash for Clunkers   that temporarily boosted the economy         Spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about  11 5trillion  but only  3trillion was spent by the end of November 2009    Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be  1 5trillion or 10 6percent of the nation s gross domestic product  GDP  compared to the 2009 deficit of  1 4trillion or 9 9percent of GDP      For 2011  the administration predicted the deficit will slightly shrink to  1 34trillion  while the 10 year deficit will increase to  8 53trillion or 90percent of GDP    The most recent increase in the U S  debt ceiling to  17 2trillion took effect in February 2014    On August 2  2011  after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation s debt limit  Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011   The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021  establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit  creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least  1 5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years  and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as  1 2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings    By passing the legislation  Congress was able to prevent a U S  government default on its obligations     As it did throughout 2008  the unemployment rate rose in 2009  reaching a peak in October at 10 0percent and averaging 10 0percent in the fourth quarter  Following a decrease to 9 7percent in the first quarter of 2010  the unemployment rate fell to 9 6percent in the second quarter  where it remained for the rest of the year    Between February and December 2010  employment rose by 0 8percent  which was less than the average of 1 9percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries    By November 2012  the unemployment rate fell to 7 7percent    decreasing to 6 7percent in the last month of 2013    During 2014  the unemployment rate continued to decline  falling to 6 3percent in the first quarter    GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009  expanding at a rate of 1 6percent  followed by a 5 0percent increase in the fourth quarter    Growth continued in 2010  posting an increase of 3 7percent in the first quarter  with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year    In July 2010  the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase  but its pace had slowed  and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was  unusually uncertain     Overall  the economy expanded at a rate of 2 9percent in 2010     The Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama s stimulus plan for economic growth      The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 12 1million          while conceding that  It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package     Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation  over a similar January survey  for the first time in two years  73percent of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment    The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II     The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States and the austerity measures in the European Union     Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections   Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary  two year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates   a one year payroll tax reduction  continuation of unemployment benefits  and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes     The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties  and the resulting  858billion Tax Relief  Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization  and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17  2010     In December 2013  Obama declared that growing income inequality is a  defining challenge of our time  and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages  This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast food workers and Pope Francis   criticism of inequality and trickle down economics      On April 20  2010  an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico   causing a major sustained oil leak   The well s operator  BP   initiated a containment and cleanup plan  and began drilling two relief wells intended to stop the flow  Obama visited the Gulf on May 2 among visits by members of his cabinet  and again on May 28 and June 4  On May 22  he announced a federal investigation and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards  after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings  On May 27  he announced a six month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases  pending regulatory review    As multiple efforts by BP failed  some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident  and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government     In July 2013  Obama expressed reservations and stated he  would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution  or  greenhouse emissions       Obama s advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013    On February 24  2015  Obama vetoed a bill that would authorize the pipeline    It was the third veto of Obama s presidency and his first major veto     Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States   a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal    He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured  to cap premium increases  and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs  His proposal was to spend  900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan  also known as the public option   to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care  It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre existing conditions   and require every American to carry health coverage  The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans       On July 14  2009  House Democratic leaders introduced a 1 017 page plan for overhauling the U S  health care system  which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009    After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009  Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals    In March 2009  Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research     On November 7  2009  a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House      On December 24  2009  the Senate passed its own billwithout a public optionon a party line vote of 6039    On March 21  2010  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  ACA  passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212    Obama signed the bill into law on March 23  2010     The ACA includes health related provisions to take effect over four years  including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133percent of the federal poverty level  FPL  starting in 2014    subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400percent of the FPL   88 000 for family of four in 2010  so their maximum  out of pocket  payment for annual premiums will be from 2 to 9 5percent of income      providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits  prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre existing conditions  establishing health insurance exchanges   prohibiting annual coverage caps  and support for medical research  According to White House and Congressional Budget Office figures  the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level       The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes  fees  and cost saving measures  such as new Medicare taxes for those in high income brackets   taxes on indoor tanning   cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare  and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies    there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance  unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons    In March 2010  the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by  143billion over the first decade     The law faced several legal challenges  primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional  On June 28  2012  the Supreme Court ruled by a 54 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v  Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U S  Congress s taxing authority    In Burwell v  Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that  closely held  for profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives  In June 2015  the Court ruled 63 in King v  Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges  not only those purchasing plans  established by the State   as the statute reads     Prior to June 2014  Obama offered substantial support for a broadly based  All of the above  approach to

Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy    Obama s approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as

minister Benjamin Netanyahu          Since the spring of 2013 secret meetings were conducted  in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City   between the United States and Cuba     The Vatican

from 1865 to 1869  Johnson became president as he was vice president at the time of President Abraham Lincoln s assassination   A Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket  Johnson came to office as the Civil War concluded  The new president favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union  His plans did not give protection to the former slaves   and he came into conflict with the Republican  dominated Congress  culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives  The first American president to be impeached  he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote   Johnson was born in poverty in Raleigh  North Carolina   Apprenticed as a tailor  he worked in several frontier towns before settling in Greeneville  Tennessee   He served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1835  After brief service in the Tennessee Senate   Johnson was elected to the federal House of Representatives in 1843  where he served five two year terms  He became Governor of Tennessee for four years  and was elected by the legislature to the Senate in 1857  In his congressional service  he sought passage of the Homestead Bill   which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862   As Southern slave states   including Tennessee  seceded to form the Confederate States of America   Johnson remained firmly with the Union  In 1862  Lincoln appointed him as military governor of Tennessee after it had been retaken  In 1864  Johnson  as a War Democrat and Southern Unionist   was a logical choice as running mate for Lincoln  who wished to send a message of national unity in his re election campaign  their ticket easily won  When Johnson was sworn in as vice president in March 1865  he gave a rambling speech  He later secluded himself to avoid public ridicule  Six weeks later  the assassination of Lincoln made him president   Johnson implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction  a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re form their civil governments  When Southern states returned many of their old leaders  and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties  Congress refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions  Johnson vetoed their bills  and Congress overrode him  setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency    Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment   which gave citizenship to former slaves  As the conflict between the branches of government grew  Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act   restricting Johnson s ability to fire Cabinet officials  When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton   he was impeached by the House of Representatives  and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office  Returning to Tennessee after his presidency  Johnson sought political vindication  and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the Senate again in 1875  the only former president to serve there   just months before his death  Although Johnson s ranking has fluctuated over time  he is generally considered among the worst American presidents for his opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African Americans      Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh  North Carolina   on December 29  1808  to Jacob Johnson  17781812  and Mary   Polly   McDonough  17831856   a laundress  His parents were of English and Scots Irish ancestry    He had a brother William  four years his senior  and an older sister Elizabeth  who died in childhood  Johnson s having been born in a log cabin was a political asset in the mid 19th century  and Johnson years later would frequently remind voters of his humble origins    Jacob Johnson was a poor man  as had been his father  William Johnson  but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family  He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell  shortly after rescuing three drowning men when his son Andrew was three    Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family  Her occupation was then looked down on  as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied  There were even rumors that Andrew  who did not resemble his brother or sister  had been fathered by another man  Polly Johnson eventually remarried  to Turner Doughtry  who was as poor as she was     Johnson s mother apprenticed her son William to a tailor  James Selby  Andrew also became an apprentice in Selby s shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday  Johnson lived with his mother for part of his service  and one of Selby s employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills    His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby s shop to read to the tailors as they worked  Even before he became an apprentice  Johnson came to listen  The readings caused a lifelong love of learning  and one of his biographers  Annette Gordon Reed   suggests that Johnson  later a gifted public speaker  learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth     Andrew Johnson was not happy at James Selby s  and after about five years  both he and his brother ran away  Selby responded by placing a reward for their return   Ten Dollars Reward  Ran away from the subscriber  two apprentice boys  legally bound  named William and Andrew Johnson     payment  to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in Raleigh  or I will give the above reward for Andrew Johnson alone     The brothers went to Carthage  North Carolina   where Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor for several months  Fearing he would be arrested and returned to Raleigh  Johnson moved to Laurens  South Carolina   He found work quickly  met his first love  Mary Wood  and made her a quilt as a gift  However  she rejected his marriage proposal  He returned to Raleigh  hoping to buy out his apprenticeship  but could not come to terms with Selby  Unable to stay in Raleigh  where he risked being apprehended for abandoning Selby  he decided to move west       Johnson left North Carolina for Tennessee  traveling mostly on foot  After a brief period in Knoxville   he moved to Mooresville  Alabama       He then worked as a tailor in Columbia  Tennessee   but was called back to Raleigh by his mother and stepfather  who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west  Johnson and his party traveled through the Blue Ridge Mountains to Greeneville  Tennessee   Andrew Johnson fell in love with the town at first sight  and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration     In Greeneville  Johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home  In 1827  at the age of 18  he married 16 year old Eliza McCardle   the daughter of a local shoemaker  The pair were married by Justice of the Peace Mordecai Lincoln  first cousin of Thomas Lincoln   whose son would become president  The Johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children  Martha  1828   Charles  1830   Mary  1832   Robert  1834   and Andrew Jr   1852   Though she suffered from consumption   Eliza supported her husband s endeavors  She taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing      Shy and retiring by nature  Eliza Johnson usually remained in Greeneville during Johnson s political rise  She was not often seen during her husband s presidency  their daughter Martha usually served as official hostess     Johnson s tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage  enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate    He later boasted of his talents as a tailor   my work never ripped or gave way     He was a voracious reader  Books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue  and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views  He also took part in debates at Greeneville College      Johnson helped organize a mechanics   working men s  ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election  He was elected town alderman  along with his friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln      Following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion   a state convention was called to pass a new constitution  including provisions to disenfranchise free people of color  The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates  and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee s infrastructure  The constitution was submitted for a public vote  and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption  the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure  On January 4  1834  his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville       In 1835  Johnson made a bid for election to the  floater  seat which Greene County shared with neighboring Washington County in the Tennessee House of Representatives   According to his biographer  Hans L  Trefousse   Johnson  demolished  the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin      Soon after taking his seat  Johnson purchased his first slave  Dolly  aged 14  Dolly had three children over the years  Johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly  and the fact that Dolly was dark skinned  and her offspring much lighter  led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father    During his Greeneville days  Johnson joined the Tennessee Militia as a member of the 90th Regiment  He attained the rank of colonel   though while an enrolled member  Johnson was fined for an unknown offense    Afterwards  he was often addressed or referred to by his rank   In his first term in the legislature  which met in the state capital of Nashville  Johnson did not consistently vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party   though he revered President Andrew Jackson   a Democrat and Tennessean  The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals  with the party system in a state of flux  The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson  fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government  Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads  while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation  After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re election in 1837  Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years  In 1839  he sought to regain his seat  initially as a Whig  but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination  he ran as a Democrat and was elected  From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County      Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party  noted for his oratory  and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it  people flocked to hear him     In 1840  Johnson was selected as a presidential elector for Tennessee  giving him more statewide publicity  Although Democratic President Martin Van Buren was defeated by former Ohio senator William Henry Harrison   Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column    He was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1841  where he served a two year term    He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business  but sold it to concentrate on politics  He had also acquired additional real estate  including a larger home and a farm  where his mother and stepfather took residence   and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves     Having served in both houses of the legislature  Johnson saw election to Congress as the next step in his political career  He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support  including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville  and defeated Jonesborough lawyer John A  Aiken by 5 495 votes to 4 892      In Washington  he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives  Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor  maintained an anti  abolitionist stance  argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs    With Eliza remaining in Greeneville  Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the Library of Congress     Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat  James K  Polk   was elected president in 1844  and Johnson had campaigned for him  the two men had difficult relations  and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions     Johnson believed  as did many Southern Democrats  that the Constitution protected private property  including slaves  and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery    He won a second term in 1845 against Wiliam G  Brownlow   presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy  In his second term  Johnson supported the Polk administration s decision to fight the Mexican War   seen by some Northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward  and opposed the Wilmot Proviso   a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from Mexico  He introduced for the first time his Homestead Bill  to grant 160 acres  65ha  to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it      This issue was especially important to Johnson because of his own humble beginnings       In the presidential election of 1848   the Democrats split over the slavery issue  and abolitionists formed the Free Soil Party   with former president Van Buren as their nominee  Johnson supported the Democratic candidate  former Michigan senator Lewis Cass   With the party split  Whig nominee General Zachary Taylor was easily victorious  and carried Tennessee    Johnson s relations with Polk remained poor  the President recorded of his final New Year s reception in 1849 that  Among the visitors I observed in the crowd today was Hon  Andrew Johnson of the Ho  Repts   House of Representatives  Though he represents a Democratic District in Tennessee  my own State  this is the first time I have seen him during the present session of Congress  Professing to be a Democrat  he has been politically  if not personally hostile to me during my whole term  He is very vindictive and perverse in his temper and conduct  If he had the manliness and independence to declare his opposition openly  he knows he could not be elected by his constituents  I am not aware that I have ever given him cause for offense     Johnson  due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district  also supported government assistance for the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad      In his campaign for a fourth term  Johnson concentrated on three issues  slavery  homesteads and judicial elections  He defeated his opponent  Nathaniel G  Taylor   in August 1849  with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns  When the House convened in December  the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a Speaker  Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality  some weeks later others took up a similar proposal  and Democrat Howell Cobb was elected     Once the Speaker election had concluded and Congress was ready to conduct legislative business  the issue of slavery took center stage  Northerners sought to admit California  a free state  to the Union  Kentucky s Henry Clay introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions  the Compromise of 1850   to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side  Johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nation s capital    He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators  then elected by state legislatures  and of the president  chosen by the Electoral College    and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years  These were all defeated     A group of Democrats nominated Landon Carter Haynes to oppose Johnson as he sought a fifth term  the Whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the Democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own  The campaign included fierce debates  Johnson s main issue was the passage of the Homestead Bill  Haynes contended it would facilitate abolition  Johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes    Though he was not enamored of the party s presidential nominee in 1852  former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce   Johnson campaigned for him  Pierce was elected  but he failed to carry Tennessee    In 1852  Johnson managed to get the House to pass his Homestead Bill  but it failed in the Senate    The Whigs had gained control of the Tennessee legislature  and  under the leadership of Gustavus Henry   redrew the boundaries of Johnson s First District to make it a safe seat for their party  The Nashville Union termed this  Henry mandering     a     lamented Johnson   I have no political future      If Johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek re election  he soon changed his mind    The congressman s political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor  The Democratic convention unanimously named him  though some party members were not happy at his selection  The Whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections  and still controlled the legislature    That party nominated Henry  making the  Henry mandering  of the First District an immediate issue    The two men debated in county seats the length of Tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the August 1853 election due to illness in Henry s family      Johnson won the election by 63 413 votes to 61 163  some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support Whig Nathaniel Taylor for his old seat in Congress       Tennessee s governor had little powerJohnson could propose legislation but not veto it  and most appointments were made by the Whig controlled legislature  Nevertheless  the office was a bully pulpit that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views    He succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of John Bell   a Whig  for one of the state s U S  Senate seats  In his first biennial speech  Johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system  abolishment of the Bank of Tennessee and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures  the last was passed  Johnson was critical of the Tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes  either statewide or county by countya mixture of the two was passed    Reforms carried out during Johnson s time as governor included the foundation of the State s public library  making books available to all  and its first public school system  and the initiation of regular State fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers     Although the Whig Party was on its final decline nationally  it remained strong in Tennessee  and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor  Feeling that re election as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought  Johnson agreed to make the run  Meredith P  Gentry received the Whig nomination  A series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued  The issues in the campaign were slavery  the prohibition of alcohol  and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party   Johnson favored the first  but opposed the others  Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question  and had gained the support of the Know Nothings  a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society    Johnson was unexpectedly victorious  albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853     When the presidential election of 1856 approached  Johnson hoped to be nominated  some Tennessee county conventions designated him a favorite son   His position that the best interests of the Union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president  He was never a major contender  the nomination fell to former Pennsylvania senator James Buchanan   Though he was not impressed by either  Johnson campaigned for Buchanan and his running mate  John C  Breckinridge   who were elected     Johnson decided not to seek a third term as governor  with an eye towards election to the U S  Senate  In 1857  while returning from Washington  his train derailed  causing serious damage to his right arm  This injury would trouble him in the years to come     The victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would  once they convened in October  elect a United States Senator  Former Whig governor William B  Campbell wrote to his uncle   The great anxiety of the Whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat Andrew Johnson for senator  Should the Democrats have the majority  he will certainly be their choice  and there is no man living to whom the Americans   b   and Whigs have as much antipathy as Johnson     The governor spoke widely in the campaign  and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature    Johnson s final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors  and he made proposals popular among Democrats  Two days later the legislature elected him to the Senate  The opposition was appalled  with the Richmond Whig newspaper referring to him as  the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the Union      Johnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self employed tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee s electorate  He called them the  plebians   he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party  but none could match him as a vote getter  After his death  one Tennessee voter wrote of him   Johnson was always the same to everyone    the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen     Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing  he cut an impressive figure    and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate  Mostly denied the party s machinery  he relied on a network of friends  advisers  and contacts    One friend  Hugh Douglas  stated in a letter to him   you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time  At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none of the rest of us Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you  Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but the people would send you       The new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857  the term of his predecessor  James C  Jones   had expired in March   He came to Washington as usual without his wife and family  Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson s first time as senator  in 1860  Johnson immediately set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate  but as most senators who supported it were Northern  many associated with the newly founded Republican Party    the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue  Southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the Homestead Bill were more likely to be Northern non slaveholders  The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court s ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v  Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories  Johnson  a slaveholding senator from a Southern state  made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible  Nevertheless  Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation  3022      In 1859  it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill  and in 1860  a watered down version passed both houses  only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners    Johnson continued his opposition to spending  chairing a committee to control it   He argued against funding to build Washington  D C  s infrastructure  stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the city s streets  even if it was the seat of government  He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory   arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army     In October 1859  abolitionist John Brown and sympathizers raided the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry   Virginia  today West Virginia   Tensions in Washington between pro  and anti slavery forces increased greatly  Johnson gave a major speech in the Senate in December  decrying Northerners who would endanger the Union by seeking to outlaw slavery  The Tennessee senator stated that  all men are created equal  from the Declaration of Independence did not apply to African Americans  since the Constitution of Illinois contained that phraseand that document barred voting by African Americans       Johnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over the slavery question  Busy with the Homestead Bill during the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston  South Carolina   he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom dealmaking  The convention deadlocked  with no candidate able to gain the required two thirds vote  but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise  The party split  with Northerners backing Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas while Southerners  including Johnson  supported Vice President Breckinridge for president  With former Tennessee senator John Bell running a fourth party candidacy and further dividing the vote  the Republican Party elected its first president  former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln   The election of Lincoln   known to be against the spread of slavery  was unacceptable to many in the South  Although secession from the Union had not been an issue in the campaign  talk of it began in the Southern states       Johnson took to the Senate floor after the election  giving a speech well received in the North   I will not give up this government    No  I intend to stand by it    and I invite every man who is a patriot to    rally around the altar of our common country    and swear by our God  and all that is sacred and holy  that the Constitution shall be saved  and the Union preserved       As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded  he reminded Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis that if Southerners would only hold to their seats  the Democrats would control the Senate  and could defend the South s interests against any infringement by Lincoln    Gordon Reed points out that while Johnson s belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere  he had alienated Southern leaders  including Davis  who would soon be the president of the Confederate States of America   formed by the seceding states  If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy  he would have had small influence in its government     Johnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession  His successor as governor  Isham G  Harris   and the legislature  organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession  when that failed  they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote  Despite threats on Johnson s life  and actual assaults  he campaigned against both questions  sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him  Although Johnson s eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession  the second referendum passed  and in June 1861  Tennessee joined the Confederacy  Believing he would be killed if he stayed  Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap   where his party was in fact shot at  He left his wife and family in Greeneville       As the only member from a seceded state to remain in the Senate and the most prominent Southern Unionist   Johnson had Lincoln s ear in the early months of the war    With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands  Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio  trying in vain to convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee     Johnson s first tenure in the Senate came to a conclusion in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee  Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered  Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area  Lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over Union controlled Southern regions    The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson s nomination along with the rank of brigadier general     In response  the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves  and turned his home into a military hospital    Later in 1862  after his departure from the Senate and in the absence of most Southern legislators  the Homestead Bill was finally enacted  Along with legislation for land grant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad   the Homestead Bill has been credited with opening the American West to settlement     As military governor  Johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state  He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials  and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers  Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands  and the ebb and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville  However  the Confederate allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him      Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could  though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest   Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S  Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863  Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year     When Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863  declaring freedom for all slaves in Confederate held areas  he exempted Tennessee at Johnson s request  The proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war  as not all Unionists supported abolition  Johnson finally decided that slavery had to end  He wrote   If the institution of slavery    seeks to overthrow it  the Government   then the Government has a clear right to destroy it     He reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the Union Army  feeling that African Americans should perform menial tasks to release white Americans to do the fighting    Nevertheless  he succeeded in recruiting 20 000 black soldiers to serve the Union     In 1860  Lincoln s running mate had been Maine Senator Hannibal Hamlin   Vice President Hamlin had served competently  was in good health  and was willing to run  Nevertheless  Johnson emerged as running mate for Lincoln s re election bid in 1864     Lincoln considered several War Democrats for the ticket in 1864  and sent an agent to sound out General Benjamin Butler as a possible running mate  In May 1864  the President dispatched General Daniel Sickles to Nashville on a fact finding mission  Although Sickles denied he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor  Johnson biographer Hans L  Trefousse believes Sickles s trip was connected to Johnson s subsequent nomination for vice president    According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson s presidency  Lincoln was impressed by Johnson s administration of Tennessee    Gordon Reed points out that while the Lincoln Hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860   having Johnson  the southern War Democrat  on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country     Another factor was the desire of Secretary of State William Seward to frustrate the vice presidential candidacy of his fellow New Yorker  former senator Daniel S  Dickinson   a War Democrat  as Seward would probably have had to yield his place if another New Yorker became vice president  Johnson  once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles  visit  was active on his own behalf  giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy     To sound a theme of unity  Lincoln in 1864 ran under the banner of the National Union Party   rather than the Republicans    At the party s convention in Baltimore in June  Lincoln was easily nominated  although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals  After the convention backed Lincoln  former Secretary of War Simon Cameron offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin  but it was defeated  Johnson was nominated for vice president by C M  Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as seconder  On the first ballot  Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson  On the second ballot  Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson  beginning a stampede  Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin s 17 and eight for Dickinson  the nomination was made unanimous  Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result   Andy Johnson  I think  is a good man     When word reached Nashville  a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union     Although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign  Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee  Kentucky  Ohio  and Indiana  He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive  in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy  The Democratic candidate for president  George McClellan   hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation  and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters  Lincoln declined to override Johnson  and their ticket took the state by 25 000 votes  Congress refused to count Tennessee s electoral votes  but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them  having won in most states that had voted  and easily secured the election     Now Vice President elect  Johnson was anxious to complete the work of re establishing civilian government in Tennessee  although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day  March 4  He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task  but was told by Lincoln s advisers that he could not stay  but would be sworn in with Lincoln  In these months  Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee  including Greeneville  Just before his departure  the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution  abolishing slavery  on February 22  1865  One of Johnson s final acts as military governor was to certify the results     Johnson traveled to Washington to be sworn in  although according to Gordon Reed   in light of what happened on March 4  1865  it might have been better if Johnson had stayed in Nashville     He may have been ill  Castel cited typhoid fever    though Gordon Reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis    On the evening of March 3  Johnson attended a party in his honor  he drank heavily  Hung over the following morning at the Capitol  he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey  Hamlin produced a bottle  and Johnson took two stiff drinks  stating  I need all the strength for the occasion I can have   In the Senate Chamber  Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln  the Congress  and dignitaries looked on  Almost incoherent at times  he finally meandered to a halt  whereupon Hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president    Lincoln  who had watched sadly during the debacle  was sworn in  and delivered his acclaimed Second Inaugural Address      In the weeks after the inauguration  Johnson only presided over the Senate briefly  and hid from public ridicule at the Maryland home of a friend  Francis Preston Blair   When he did return to Washington  it was with the intent of leaving for Tennessee to re establish his family in Greeneville  Instead  he remained after word came that General Ulysses S  Grant had captured the Confederate capital of Richmond  Virginia   presaging the end of the war    Lincoln stated  in response to criticism of Johnson s behavior  that  I have known Andy Johnson for many years  he made a bad slip the other day  but you need not be scared  Andy ain t a drunkard      On the afternoon of April 14  1865  Lincoln and Johnson met for the first time since the inauguration  Trefousse states that Johnson wanted to  induce Lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors   Gordon Reed agrees       That night  President Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by John Wilkes Booth   a Confederate sympathizer  The shooting of the President was part of a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln  Johnson  and Seward the same night  Seward barely survived his wounds  while Johnson escaped attack as his would be assassin  George Atzerodt   got drunk instead of killing the vice president  Leonard J  Farwell   a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House  awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln s shooting at Ford s Theatre   Johnson rushed to the President s deathbed  where he remained a short time  on his return promising   They shall suffer for this  They shall suffer for this     Lincoln died at 7 22am the next morning  Johnson s swearing in occurred between 10 and 11am with Chief Justice Salmon P  Chase presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet  Johnson s demeanor was described by the newspapers as  solemn and dignified     Some Cabinet members had last seen Johnson  apparently drunk  at the inauguration    At noon  Johnson conducted his first Cabinet meeting in the Treasury Secretary s office  and asked all members to remain in their positions     The events of the assassination resulted in speculation  then and subsequently  concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him  In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture  Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy  but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse  Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination  Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards  This object was received by Johnson s private secretary  William A  Browning  with an inscription   Are you at home  Don t wish to disturb you  J  Wilkes Booth      Johnson presided with dignity over Lincoln s funeral ceremonies in Washington  before his predecessor s body was sent home to Springfield  Illinois   for burial    Shortly after Lincoln s death  Union General William T  Sherman reported he had  without consulting Washington  reached an armistice agreement with Confederate General Joseph E  Johnston for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power  with private property rights to be respected  This did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery  This was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet who sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals  which he did  Further  Johnson placed a  100 000 bounty on Confederate President Davis  then a fugitive  which gave him the reputation of a man who would be tough on the South  More controversially  he permitted the execution of Mary Surratt for her part in Lincoln s assassination  Surratt was executed with three others  including Atzerodt  on July 7  1865     Upon taking office  Johnson faced the question of what to do with the Confederacy  President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia  Arkansas  Louisiana  and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union  Congress considered this too lenient  its own plan   requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath  passed both houses in 1864  but Lincoln pocket vetoed it     Johnson had three goals in Reconstruction  He sought a speedy restoration of the states  on the grounds that they had never truly left the Union  and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government  To Johnson  African American suffrage was a delay and a distraction  it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote  Second  political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved  plebians   Johnson feared that the freedmen  many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters  might vote at their direction  Johnson s third priority was election in his own right in 1868  a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish     The Republicans had formed a number of factions  The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans  They believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation  and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats  including former rebels  out of influence  They believed that top Confederates should be punished  The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level  and prevent former rebels from resuming power  They were not as enthusiastic about the idea of African American suffrage as their Radical colleagues  either because of their own local political concerns  or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly  Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states  They did not support African American suffrage  which might threaten Democratic control in the South     Johnson was initially left to devise a Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention  as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865    Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union  But Johnson  with the support of other officials including Seward  insisted that the franchise was a state  not a federal matter  The Cabinet was divided on the issue     Johnson s first Reconstruction actions were two proclamations  with the unanimous backing of his Cabinet  on May 29  One recognized the Virginia government led by provisional Governor Francis Pierpont   The second provided amnesty for all ex rebels except those holding property valued at  20 000 or more  it also appointed a temporary governor for North Carolina and authorized elections  Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmen s rights  The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states     As Southern states began the process of forming governments  Johnson s policies received considerable public support in the North  which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South  While he received such support from the white South  he underestimated the determination of Northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing  It was important  in Northern public opinion  that the South acknowledge its defeat  that slavery be ended  and that the lot of African Americans be improved  Voting rights were less importantafter all  only a handful of Northern states  mostly in New England  gave African American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites  and in late 1865  Connecticut  Wisconsin  and Minnesota voted down African American suffrage proposals by large margins  Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson s inaction on black suffrage as an experiment  to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat  Instead  white Southerners felt emboldened  A number of Southern states passed Black Codes   binding African American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit  and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor  Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates  with the most prominent being Georgia Senator designate and former Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens   Congress assembled in early December 1865  Johnson s conciliatory annual message to them was well received  Nevertheless  Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation     Northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant Confederate leaders  such as Stephens  rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw  They saw the Black Codes placing African Americans in a position barely above slavery  Republicans also feared that restoration of the Southern states would return the Democrats to power      In addition  according to David O  Stewart in his book on Johnson s impeachment   the violence and poverty that oppressed the South would galvanize the opposition to Johnson      Congress was reluctant to confront the President  and initially only sought to fine tune Johnson s policies towards the South    According to Trefousse   If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party  it was the period following the return of Congress     The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states  and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there  but made no statement publicly  believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did  even if it was unwise to do so  By late January 1866  he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans  both for the success of Reconstruction and for re election in 1868  He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African Americans in the District of Columbia  a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all white referendum  A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives  but to Johnson s disappointment  stalled in the Senate before he could veto it     Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull   leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  was anxious to reach an understanding with the President  He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen s Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867  and the first Civil Rights Bill  to grant citizenship to the freedmen  Trumbull met several times with Johnson  and was convinced the President would sign the measures  Johnson rarely contradicted visitors  often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord   In fact  the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty  Additionally  both of Trumbull s bills were unpopular among white Southerners  whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party  Johnson vetoed the Freedman s Bureau bill on February 18  1866  to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators  He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day    Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated  and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him  he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly     On February 22  1866  Washington s Birthday   Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the White House and called for an address in honor of the first president   In his hour long speech  he instead referred to himself over 200 times  More damagingly  he also spoke of  men    still opposed to the Union  to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South      When called upon by the crowd to say who they were  Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens   Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner   and abolitionist Wendell Phillips   and accused them of plotting his assassination  Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war  while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson s speech cost the party 200 000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections     Although strongly urged by Moderates to sign the Civil Rights Bill   Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27  In his veto message  he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress  and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites      Within three weeks  Congress had overridden his veto  the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history    The veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1866   often seen as a key mistake of Johnson s presidency  convinced Moderates there was no hope of working with him  Historian Eric Foner in his volume on Reconstruction views it as  the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career   According to Stewart  the veto was  for many his defining blunder  setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency      Congress also proposed the Fourteenth Amendment to the states  Written by Trumbull and others  it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part  though Johnson opposed it  The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution  but also went further  The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States  except Indians on reservations   penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen  and most importantly  created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts  It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts  Further  it disqualified many former Confederates from office  although the disability could be removedby Congress  not the president    Both houses passed the Freedmen s Bureau Act a second time  and again the President vetoed it  this time  the veto was overridden  By the summer of 1866  when Congress finally adjourned  Johnson s method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat  without safeguards for the freedmen  was in deep trouble  His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President s opposition    When Tennessee did so  Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation  embarrassing Johnson     Efforts to compromise failed    and a political war ensued between the united Republicans on one side  and on the other  Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party  North and South  He called a convention of the National Union Party  Republicans had returned to using their previous identifier  Johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term  in 1868    The battleground was the election of 1866   Southern states were not allowed to vote  Johnson campaigned vigorously  undertaking a public speaking tour  known as the   Swing Around the Circle    The trip  including speeches in Chicago  St  Louis  Indianapolis and Columbus  proved politically disastrous  with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ  and engaging in arguments with hecklers  These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency  The Republicans won by a landslide  increasing their two thirds majority in Congress  and made plans to control Reconstruction    Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement     Even with the Republican victory in November 1866  Johnson considered himself in a strong position  The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or border states except Tennessee  and had been rejected in Kentucky  Delaware  and Maryland  As the amendment required ratification by three quarters of the states to become part of the Constitution  he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor  leading to his election in 1868  Once it reconvened in December 1866  an energized Congress began passing legislation  often over a presidential veto  this included the District of Columbia voting bill  Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto  and the Republicans gained two senators  and a state that promptly ratified the amendment  Johnson s veto of a bill for statehood for Colorado Territory was sustained  enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30 000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day     In January 1867  Congressman Stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts  under martial law   The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions  African Americans could vote for or become delegates  former Confederates could not  In the legislative process  Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state s ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment  and completion of the process of adding it to the Constitution  Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise  whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates  and for limited black suffrage  The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment  and the deal fell through  Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty Ninth Congress  he chose to veto it directly on March 2  1867  Congress overruled him the same day  Also on March 2  Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President s veto  in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him  This bill  requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards  was immediately controversial  with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson  whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers     Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was an able and hard working man  but difficult to deal with    Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary  who  in combination with General of the Army Grant  worked to undermine the president s Southern policy from within his own administration  Johnson considered firing Stanton  but respected him for his wartime service as secretary  Stanton  for his part  feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign  despite his public disagreements with his president     The new Congress met for a few weeks in March 1867  then adjourned  leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind  charged with reporting back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached  This committee duly met  examining the President s bank accounts  and summoning members of the Cabinet to testify  When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13  he had been captured shortly after the war   the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution  It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried  A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges  the committee adjourned on June 3     Later in June  Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities  The President had Attorney General Henry Stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not  Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for  and thus endorsing Johnson s position  or against  showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet  Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications  When Congress reconvened in July  it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson s position  waited for his veto  overruled it  and went home  In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals  the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South  With Congress in recess until November  Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders  General Philip Sheridan   who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support  He was initially deterred by a strong objection from Grant  On August 5  the President demanded Stanton s resignation  the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session    Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act  Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army     Grant  under protest  followed Johnson s order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders  Daniel Sickles   who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress s plan  The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates  exempting those who held office under the Confederacy  or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths  Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions  the 1867 elections generally went Democratic  No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling  but the Democrats took control of the Ohio General Assembly   allowing them to defeat for re election one of Johnson s strongest opponents  Senator Benjamin Wade   Voters in Ohio  Connecticut  and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote    The adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson  who was elated by the elections    Nevertheless  once Congress met in November  the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson  After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor  the standard under the Constitution  the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7  1867  by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed     Johnson notified Congress of Stanton s suspension and Grant s interim appointment  In January 1868  the Senate disapproved of his action  and reinstated Stanton  contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act  Grant stepped aside over Johnson s objection  causing a complete break between them  Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed Lorenzo Thomas to replace him  Stanton refused to leave his office  and on February 24  1868  the House impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act  by a vote of 128 to 47  The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment  for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act  and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress     On March 5  1868  the impeachment trial began in the Senate and lasted almost three months  Congressmen George S  Boutwell   Benjamin Butler and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House  or prosecutors  and William M  Evarts   Benjamin R  Curtis and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson s counsel  Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge    The defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration  Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton  the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act  and also argued that the President had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress    Johnson s counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial  nor publicly comment about the proceedings  and except for a pair of interviews in April  he complied     Johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal  for example  he pledged to Iowa Senator James W  Grimes that he would not interfere with Congress s Reconstruction efforts  Grimes reported to a group of Moderates  many of whom voted for acquittal  that he believed the President would keep his word  Johnson also promised to install the respected John Schofield as War Secretary    Kansas Senator Edmund G  Ross received assurances that the new  Radical influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay  an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal    One reason senators were reluctant to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade  the president pro tempore of the Senate  Wade  a lame duck who left office in early 1869  was a Radical who supported such measures as women s suffrage  placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation      Additionally  a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant s ambitions     With the dealmaking  Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict  and in the days leading up to the ballot  newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up  On May 16  the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment  accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension  Thirty five senators voted  guilty  and 19  not guilty   thus falling short by a single vote of the two thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution  Seven RepublicansSenators Grimes  Ross  Trumbull  William Pitt Fessenden   Joseph S  Fowler   John B  Henderson   and Peter G  Van Winkle voted to acquit the President  With Stevens bitterly disappointed at the result  the Senate then adjourned for the Republican National Convention   Grant was nominated for president  The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles  with identical 3519 results  Faced with those results  Johnson s opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings      Stanton  relinquished  his office on May 26  and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield    When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as Attorney General after his service as a defense manager  the Senate refused to confirm him     Allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial  Even when it was in progress  Representative Butler began an investigation  held contentious hearings  and issued a report  unendorsed by any other congressman  Butler focused on a New Yorkbased  Astor House Group   supposedly led by political boss and editor Thurlow Weed   This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson  Butler went so far as to imprison Woolley in the Capitol building when he refused to answer questions  but failed to prove bribery     Soon after taking office as president  Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State William H  Seward that there would be no change in foreign policy  In practice  this meant that Seward would continue to run things as he had under Lincoln  Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860  the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869  At the time of Johnson s accession  the French had intervened in Mexico   sending troops there  While many politicians had indulged in saber rattling over the Mexican matter  Seward preferred quiet diplomacy  warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was not acceptable  Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach  Seward persuaded him to follow his lead  In April 1866  the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages  to conclude by November 1867     Seward was an expansionist  and sought opportunities to gain territory for the United States  By 1867  the Russian government saw its North American colony  today Alaska  as a financial liability  and feared losing control as American settlement reached there  It instructed its minister in Washington  Baron Eduard de Stoeckl   to negotiate a sale  De Stoeckl did so deftly  getting Seward to raise his offer from  5 million  coincidentally  the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept  to  7 million  and then getting  200 000 added by raising various objections    This sum of  7 2 million is equivalent to  121million in present day terms    On March 30  1867  de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty  working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn  Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President s Room in the Capitol  only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment  The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1  that body approved the treaty  372    Emboldened by his success in Alaska  Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere  His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific  which would be officially claimed by the U S  in 1898   He came close with the Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite  but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired     Another treaty that fared badly was the Johnson Clarendon convention  negotiated in settlement of the Alabama Claims   for damages to American shipping from British built Confederate raiders  Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain   former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson   in late 1868  it was ignored by the Senate during the remainder of the President s term  The treaty was rejected after he left office  and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain       Johnson appointed nine Article III federal judges during his presidency  all to United States district courts   he did not appoint a justice to serve on the Supreme Court   In April 1866  he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of John Catron   but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment  and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well  providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office    Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony  Samuel Milligan   to the United States Court of Claims   where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874       Johnson sought nomination by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868  He remained very popular among Southern whites  and boosted that popularity by issuing  just before the convention  a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted  meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial  On the first ballot  Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H  Pendleton   who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864  Johnson s support was mostly from the South  and fell away as the ballots passed  On the 22nd ballot  former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated  and the President received only four votes  all from Tennessee     The conflict with Congress continued  Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six year term and make the president and the Senate directly elected  and for term limits for judges  Congress took no action on them  When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures  Congress passed a bill  again over his veto  requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt  He still delayed as much as he could  but was required  in July 1868  to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution     Seymour s operatives sought Johnson s support  but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign  It was not until October  with the vote already having taken place in some states  that he mentioned Seymour at all  and he never endorsed him  Nevertheless  Johnson regretted Grant s victory  in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair  In his annual message to Congress in December  Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865  all would have been well  He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children  though not including those of President elect Grant  who did not allow his to go     On Christmas Day 1868  Johnson issued a final amnesty  this one covering everyone  including Davis  He also issued  in his final months in office  pardons for crimes  including one for Dr  Samuel Mudd   controversially convicted of involvement in the Lincoln assassination  he had set Booth s broken leg  and imprisoned in Fort Jefferson on Florida s Dry Tortugas      On March 3  the President hosted a large public reception at the White House on his final full day in office  Grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as Johnson  as was customary  and Johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all  Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind  he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last minute business  and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend       After leaving the presidency  Johnson remained for some weeks in Washington  then returned to Greeneville for the first time in eight years  He was honored with large public celebrations along the way  especially in Tennessee  where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners  He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency     Some expected Johnson to seek to be Tennessee s governor again or to attempt a return to the Senate  others that he would become a railroad executive    Johnson found Greeneville boring  and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869    Seeking vindication for himself  and revenge against his political enemies  he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home  Tennessee had gone Republican  but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the Ku Klux Klan kept down the African American vote  leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869  Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election  although hated by Radical Republicans  and also by some Democrats because of his wartime activities  Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature s balloting  the Republicans eventually elected Henry Cooper over Johnson  5451    In 1872  there was a special election for an at large congressional seat for Tennessee   Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination  but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general Benjamin F  Cheatham   decided to run as an independent  The former president was defeated  finishing third  but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally  Horace Maynard      In 1873 Johnson contracted cholera during an epidemic but recovered  that year he lost about  73 000  when the First National Bank of Washington went under  though he was eventually repaid much of the sum    He began looking towards the next Senate election  to take place in the legislature in early 1875  Johnson began to woo the farmers  Grange movement   with his Jeffersonian leanings   he easily gained their support  He spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour  Few African Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee  setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states  the white domination would last almost a century  In the Tennessee legislative elections in August  the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans  eight  and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session  When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20  1875  he led with 30 votes  but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals  one former colonel  and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him  Johnson s opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him  but failed  and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot  with a margin of a single vote  Nashville erupted in rejoicing      remarked Johnson   Thank God for the vindication      Johnson s comeback garnered national attention  with the St  Louis Republican calling it   the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show     At his swearing in in the Senate on March 5  1875  he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president  Hamlin  by that office s current incumbent  Henry Wilson   who as senator had voted for his ousting  Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson  though some  such as Ohio s John Sherman  who had voted for conviction   shook his hand  Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate  He spoke only once in the short session  on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana s Reconstruction government  The former president asked   How far off is military despotism   and concluded his speech   may God bless this people and God save the Constitution      Johnson returned home after the special session concluded  In late July  convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race  he decided to travel there to give speeches  He began the trip on July 28  and broke the journey at his daughter Mary s farm near Elizabethton   where his daughter Martha was also staying  That evening he suffered a stroke  but refused medical treatment until the next day  when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton  He seemed to respond to their ministrations  but suffered another stroke on the evening of July 30  and died early the following morning at the age of 66  President Grant had the  painful duty  of announcing the death of the only surviving past president  Northern newspapers  in their obituaries  tended to focus on Johnson s loyalty during the war  while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president  Johnson s funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville      He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U S  Constitution placed under his head  according to his wishes  The burial ground was dedicated as the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in 1906  and with his home and tailor s shop  is part of the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site      According to Castel   historians  of Johnson s presidency  have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event  Reconstruction      Through the remainder of the 19th century  there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency  Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him  such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator James G  Blaine   depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the South in Reconstruction  but who was frustrated by Congress    According to historian Howard K  Beale in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction   Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth  Thus  Alabama congressman and historian  Hilary Herbert and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies  and Henry Wilson s history was a brief for the North      The turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of Johnson  Leading the wave was Pulitzer Prize winning historian James Ford Rhodes   who wrote of the former president     Johnson acted in accordance with his nature  He had intellectual force but it worked in a groove  Obstinate rather than firm it undoubtedly seemed to him that following counsel and making concessions were a display of weakness  At all events from his December message to the veto of the Civil Rights Bill he yielded not a jot to Congress  The moderate senators and representatives  who constituted a majority of the Union party  asked him for only a slight compromise  their action was really an entreaty that he would unite with them to preserve Congress and the country from the policy of the radicals    His quarrel with Congress prevented the readmission into the Union on generous terms of the members of the late Confederacy    His pride of opinion  his desire to beat  blinded him to the real welfare of the South and of the whole country     Rhodes ascribed Johnson s faults to his personal weaknesses  and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum South    Other early 20th century historians  such as John Burgess   Woodrow Wilson  who later became president himself  and William Dunning   all Southerners  concurred with Rhodes  believing Johnson flawed and politically inept  but concluding that he had tried to carry out Lincoln s plans for the South in good faith    Author and journalist Jay Tolson suggests that Wilson  depict ed Reconstruction  as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists  the so called Carpetbaggers  and cynical white southerners  or Scalawags  who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain      Even as Rhodes and his school wrote  another group of historians was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson  using for the first time primary sources such as his papers  provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901  and the diaries of Johnson s Navy Secretary  Gideon Welles   first published in 1911  The resulting volumes  such as David Miller DeWitt s The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson  1903   presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him  In James Schouler s 1913 History of the Reconstruction Period   the author accused Rhodes of being  quite unfair to Johnson   though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves  These works had an effect  although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency  they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct    A series of highly favorable biographies in the late 1920s and early 1930s that  glorified Johnson and condemned his enemies  accelerated this trend       Beale wondered in 1940   is it not time that we studied the history of Reconstruction without first assuming  at least subconsciously  that carpetbaggers and Southern white Republicans were wicked  that Negroes were illiterate incompetents  and that the whole white South owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of  white supremacy      Despite these doubts  the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time  In 1942  Van Heflin portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the Hollywood film Tennessee Johnson   In 1948  a poll of his colleagues by historian Arthur M  Schlesinger deemed Johnson among the average presidents  in 1956  one by Clinton L  Rossiter named him as one of the near great Chief Executives    Foner notes that at the time of these surveys   the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote      Earlier historians  including Beale  believed that money drives events  and had seen Reconstruction as an economic struggle  They also accepted  for the most part  that reconciliation between North and South should have been the top priority of Reconstruction  In the 1950s  historians began to focus on the African American as central to Reconstruction  They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority  which had marked many earlier historical works  and saw the developing Civil Rights Era as a second Reconstruction  some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights  These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American  and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman  In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as Fawn Brodie   the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman s lot  These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton    Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society       In the early 21st century  Johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in U S  history    According to historian Glenn W  Lafantasie  who believes Buchanan the worst president   Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment    his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy    his bristling personality  and his enormous sense of self importance     Tolson suggests that  Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well being of the newly emancipated African Americans     Gordon Reed notes that Johnson  along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan  are generally listed among the five worst presidents  but states   there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation  The problems these men had to confront were enormous  It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice      Trefousse considers Johnson s legacy to be  the maintenance of white supremacy  His boost to Southern conservatives by undermining Reconstruction was his legacy to the nation  one that would trouble the country for generations to come     Gordon Reed states of Johnson   We know the results of Johnson s failuresthat his preternatural stubbornness  his mean and crude racism  his primitive and instrumental understanding of the Constitution stunted his capacity for enlightened and forward thinking leadership when those qualities were so desperately needed  At the same time  Johnson s story has a miraculous quality to it  the poor boy who systematically rose to the heights  fell from grace  and then fought his

  for his handling of the Iraq War  Hurricane Katrina         and other challenges  Amid this criticism  the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections   In December 2007  the United States entered its longest post  World War II recession  often referred to as the   Great Recession    prompting the Bush Administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country s financial system  Nationally  Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history  having received the highest recorded presidential

earned an M B A  degree  He is the only U S  President to have earned an M B A     In May 1968  Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard     After two years of active duty service while training    he was assigned to Houston  flying Convair F 102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base       Critics  including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe   have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father s political standing as a member of the House of Representatives   citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance    In June 2005  the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush s Texas Air National Guard service  which remain in its official archives     In late 1972 and early 1973  he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard   having moved to Montgomery  Alabama   to work on the unsuccessful U S  Senate campaign of Republican Winton M  Blount       In 1972  Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam    He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21  1974     At a backyard barbecue in 1977  friends introduced him to Laura Lane Welch   a school teacher and librarian  Bush proposed to her after a three month courtship  and they married on November 5 of that year    The couple settled in Midland  Texas  Bush left his family s Episcopal Church to join his wife s United Methodist Church     On November 25  1981  Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters  Barbara Pierce Bush and Jenna Welch Bush     they graduated from high school in 2000 and from Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin   respectively  in 2004   Prior to his marriage  Bush had multiple episodes of alcohol abuse    In one instance  on September 4  1976  he was arrested near his family s summer home in Kennebunkport   Maine  for driving under the influence of alcohol  He pleaded guilty  was fined  150 and had his Maine driver s license briefly suspended    Bush says his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life    and attributes to her influence his 1986 decision to give up alcohol    While Governor of Texas  Bush said of his wife   I saw an elegant  beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful  but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges  and I must confess has smoothed them off over time      Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life  preferring biographies and histories    During his time as president  Bush read the Bible daily    He also read 14 Lincoln biographies and  during the last three years of his presidency  he reportedly read 186 books  A reporter recalls seeing  books by John Fowles   F  Scott Fitzgerald   James Joyce   and Gore Vidal lying about  as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria   in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman  Other hobbies include cigar smoking and golf    Since leaving the White House  Bush has also taken up oil painting     His first granddaughter  Margaret Laura  Mila  Hager  was born to his daughter Jenna Bush on April 14  2013  She is named after her two grandmothers     In 1978  Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas s 19th congressional district   His opponent  Kent Hance   portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans  Bush lost the election by 6 000 votes  6percent  of the 103 000 votes cast    He returned to the oil industry and began a series of small  independent oil exploration companies    He created Arbusto Energy     and later changed the name to Bush Exploration  In 1984  his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7   and Bush became chairman    The company was hurt by decreased oil prices  and it folded into HKN  Inc      Bush served on the board of directors for HKN    Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose  but the Securities and Exchange Commission s  SEC  investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading       Bush moved his family to Washington  D C  in 1988 to work on his father s campaign for the U S  presidency      He served as a campaign adviser and liaison to the media    he assisted his father by campaigning across the country    Returning to Texas after the successful campaign  he purchased a share in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise in April 1989  where he served as managing general partner for five years    He actively led the team s projects and regularly attended its games  often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans    Bush s sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over  15million from his initial  800 000 investment     In December 1991  Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father s 1992 Presidential re election campaign as  campaign advisor     The prior month  his father asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H  Sununu that he should resign     As Bush s brother  Jeb  sought the governorship of Florida  Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election  His campaign focused on four themes  welfare reform  tort reform   crime reduction  and education improvement    Bush s campaign advisers were Karen Hughes   Joe Allbaugh   and Karl Rove      After easily winning the Republican primary  Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards       In the course of the campaign  Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons   Richards had vetoed the bill  but Bush signed it after he became governor    According to The Atlantic Monthly   the race  featured a rumor that she was a lesbian  along with a rare instance of such a tactic s making it into the public recordwhen a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself  perhaps inadvertently  to be quoted criticizing Richards for  appointing avowed homosexual activists   to state jobs     The Atlantic   and others  connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove    but Rove denied being involved    Bush won the general election with 53 5percent against Richards  45 9percent     Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas s largest tax cut   2 billion    He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse  and helping to reduce domestic violence     Critics contended that during his tenure  Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations  Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores     In 1999  Bush signed a state law obliging electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources  RPS          which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U S         In 1998  Bush won re election with a record   69percent of the vote    He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four year terms    For most of Texas history  governors served two year terms  a constitutional amendment extended those terms to four years starting in 1975    In his second term  Bush promoted faith based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings    He proclaimed June 10  2000 to be Jesus Day in Texas  a day on which he  urge d  all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need      Throughout Bush s first term  national attention focused on him as a potential future presidential candidate  Following his re election  speculation soared    Within a year  he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination   In June 1999  while Governor of Texas  Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States  With no incumbent running  Bush entered a large field of candidates for the Republican Party presidential nomination consisting of John McCain   Alan Keyes   Steve Forbes   Gary Bauer   Orrin Hatch   Elizabeth Dole   Dan Quayle   Pat Buchanan   Lamar Alexander   John Kasich   and Robert C  Smith    Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative   implying he was more centrist than other Republicans  He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House  increasing the size of the United States Armed Forces   cutting taxes  improving education  and aiding minorities    By early 2000  the race had centered on Bush and McCain     Bush won the Iowa caucuses   but  although he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary   he trailed McCain by 19percent and lost that primary  Despite this  Bush regained momentum and  according to political observers  effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary   which according to The Boston Globe made history for his campaign s negativity  The New York Times described it as a smear campaign          On July 25  2000  Bush surprised some observers by asking Dick Cheney   a former White House Chief of Staff   U S  Representative   and Secretary of Defense   to be his running mate   Cheney was then serving as head of Bush s Vice Presidential search committee  Soon after  Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the 2000 Republican National Convention    Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas    Bush s campaign criticized his Democratic opponent  incumbent Vice President Al Gore   over gun control and taxation     When the election returns came in on November 7  Bush won 29 states  including Florida  The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount     The initial recount also went to Bush  but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching the U S  Supreme Court     On December 9  in the controversial Bush v  Gore ruling    the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision ordering a third count  and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida s counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment     The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast    Although he received 543 895 fewer individual votes than Gore nationwide  Bush won the election  receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore s 266     In 2004  Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge  He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager  with a political strategy devised by Karl Rove     Bush and the Republican platform included a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan    support for the USA PATRIOT Act     a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same sex marriage       reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts    creation of an ownership society     and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls    Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants    which was criticized by conservatives     The Bush campaign advertised across the U S  against Democratic candidates  including Bush s emerging opponent  Massachusetts Senator John Kerry   Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War   and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth  The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government  The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry s seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq    and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror   In the election  Bush carried 31 of 50 states  receiving a total of 286 electoral votes   He won an outright majority of the popular vote  50 7percent to his opponent s 48 3percent     The previous President to win an outright majority of the popular vote was Bush s father in the 1988 election  Additionally  it was the first time since Herbert Hoover  s election in 1928 that a Republican president was elected alongside re elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress   Though Bush originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda  his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001    Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq with significant domestic debates regarding immigration  healthcare  Social Security  economic policy  and treatment of terrorist detainees  Over an eight year period  Bush s once high approval ratings   steadily declined  while his disapproval numbers increased significantly    In 2007  the United States entered the longest post World War II recession     Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the Dot com bubble     The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy  The Bush administration increased federal government spending from  1 789 trillion to  2 983 trillion  60percent  while revenues increased from  2 025 trillion to  2 524 trillion  from 2000 to 2008   Individual income tax revenues increased by 14percent  corporate tax revenues by 50percent  customs and duties by 40percent  Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107percent  discretionary domestic spending by 62percent  Medicare spending by 131percent  social security by 51percent  and income security spending by 130percent  Cyclically adjusted  revenues rose by 35percent and spending by 65percent     The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B  Johnson     The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91 196     The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was  237 billionthe third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever    In 2001  Bush s budget estimated that there would be a  5 6trillion surplus over the next ten years    Facing congressional opposition  Bush held townhall style meetings across the U S  in order to increase public support for his plan for a  1 35trillion tax cut program one of the largest tax cuts in U S  history    Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers  saying  the surplus is not the government s money  The surplus is the people s money     Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs    Treasury Secretary Paul O Neill   opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security     O Neill disputes the claim  made in Bush s book Decision Points   that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts    By 2003  the economy showed signs of improvement  though job growth remained stagnant    Another tax cut program was passed that year   During the 2001 to 2008 years  GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2 125percent    less than for past business cycles     Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10 587  and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14 000  When Bush left office  the average was at 7 949  one of the lowest levels of his presidency     Unemployment originally rose from 4 2percent in January 2001 to 6 3percent in June 2003  but subsequently dropped to 4 5percent as of July 2007    Adjusted for inflation  median household income dropped by  1 175 between 2000 and 2007    while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that  Median real after tax household income went up 2      The poverty rate increased from 11 3percent in 2000 to 12 3percent in 2006 after peaking at 12 7percent in 2004    By October 2008  due to increases in spending    the national debt had risen to  11 3trillion    an increase of over 100percent from 2000 when the debt was only  5 6trillion      Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the   Bush tax cuts   and increased national security spending    In March 2006  then Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling    The fact that we are here today to debate raising America s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure     By the end of Bush s presidency  unemployment climbed to 7 2percent     In December 2007  the United States entered the longest post World War II recession    which included a housing market correction   a subprime mortgage crisis   soaring oil prices   and a declining dollar value    In February  63 000 jobs were lost  a five year record      To aid with the situation  Bush signed a  170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses  The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003    and after two years  the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate  Many Republican senators  as well as influential members of the Bush Administration  feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector s risky practices        In September 2008  the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for  85billion     Many economists and world governments determined that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression       Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial  according to former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan     Bush  meanwhile  proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U S  mortgage market    Vince Reinhardt  a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute   said  it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely   and additionally  that it would have helped  for Congress to have held hearings      In November 2008  over 500 000 jobs were lost  which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years    The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008  1 9million jobs were lost    By the end of 2008  the U S  had lost a total of 2 6million jobs     Bush undertook a number of educational priorities  such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office  and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students  Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006  the first such cut in 36 years  due to rising inflation     One of the administration s early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act   which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance  provide options to parents with students in low performing schools  and target more federal funding to low income schools  This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support  including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts     It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002    Many contend that the initiative has been successful  as cited by the fact that students in the U S  have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed  No Child Left Behind  into law    Critics argue that it is underfunded   and that NCLBA s focus on  high stakes testing  and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive     After being re elected  Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that  according to Jan Crawford Greenburg   resulted in  the greatest expansion in America s welfare state in forty years   the bill s costs approached  7trillion    In 2007  Bush opposed and vetoed State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  legislation  which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress  The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low income families from about sixmillion to tenmillion children  It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax    Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care   and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as  83 000 per year who did not need the help     Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003   Bush signed the bill  which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs  while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits    The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement  Bush said the law  estimated to cost  400billion over the first ten years  would give the elderly  better choices and more control over their health care      Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social Security    which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005  Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U S  Congress    In his 2005 State of the Union Address   Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program  which included partial privatization of the system  personal Social Security accounts  and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax   FICA   into secured investments    Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system     Bush embarked on a 60 day national tour  campaigning for his initiative in media events known as  Conversations on Social Security   in an attempt to gain public support    Nevertheless  public support for the proposal declined   and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda    The proposal s legislative prospects were further diminished by the political fallout from Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005    After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections   there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office   Upon taking office in 2001  Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol   an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  citing that the treaty exempted 80percent of the world s population   and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year    He also cited that the Senate had voted 950 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol   In May 2001  Bush signed an executive order to create an inter agency task force to streamline energy projects    and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues     In 2002  Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003     aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs  Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal    The initiative was introduced to Congress  but failed to make it out of committee   Bush has said that he believes that global warming is real   and has noted that it is a serious problem  but he asserted there is a  debate over whether it s man made or naturally caused     The Bush Administration s stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities  Critics have alleged that the administration   misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming     In his 2006 State of the Union Address   Bush declared   America is addicted to oil  and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research     That same year  Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument  creating the largest marine reserve to date  The Papah naumoku kea Marine National Monument comprises 84million acres  340 000km 2   and is home to 7 000 species of fish  birds  and other marine animals  many of which are specific to only those islands    The move was hailed by conservationists for  its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area      In his 2007 State of the Union Address   Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production    Amid high gasoline prices in 2008  Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling     However  the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling  Bush said   This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U S  Congress     Bush had said in June 2008   In the long run  the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies  My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells      In the short run  the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil  And that means we need to increase supply  especially here at home  So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production      In his 2008 State of the Union Address   Bush announced that the U S  would commit  2billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change  saying   Along with contributions from other countries  this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner  more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China  and help leverage substantial private sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive   He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States  commitment to work with major economies  and  through the UN  to complete an international agreement that will slow  stop  and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases  he stated   This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride      Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the Dickey Wicker Amendment by Congress and the signature of President Bill Clinton     Bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research  However  Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research    On August 9  2001  Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing  lines  of stem cells    but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned  Testing can only be done on 12 of the original lines  and all of the approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells  which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines    On July 19  2006  Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   The bill would have repealed the Dickey Wicker Amendment  thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo     On May 21  2008 President George W  Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act  GINA       The bill protects Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment  The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law  It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research   Nearly 8million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005  more than in any other five year period in the nation s history    Almost half entered illegally    In 2006  Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a  temporary guest worker program   Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6 000 National Guard troops to the MexicoUnited States border     From May to June 2007  Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007   which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration    The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants  with an eventual path to citizenship  establishing a guest worker program  a series of border and work site enforcement measures  a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point based  merit  system for green cards  elimination of   chain migration   and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa   and other measures  Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U S  laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation  and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor    Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty     A heated public debate followed  which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party  most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions    The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28  2007  when a cloture motion failed on a 4653 vote    Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives    The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law     On September 19  2010  former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100 000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority     Hurricane Katrina   one of the most damaging natural disasters in U S  history  struck early in Bush s second term  Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north central Gulf Coast of the United States   particularly New Orleans     Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27    and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day    he authorized the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  and Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to manage the disaster  but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action    The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29  and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches  later that day  Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana    officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort   On August 30  DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it  an incident of national significance     triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan   Three days later  on September 2  National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans    The same day  Bush toured parts of Louisiana  Mississippi   and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was  not enough      As the disaster in New Orleans intensified  critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration s role in what they saw as a flawed response  Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA  notably Michael D  Brown     it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War   and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods        Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government s failures in its handling of the emergency    It has been argued that with Katrina  Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover     During Bush s second term  a controversy arose over the Justice Department s midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys     The White House maintained that the U S  attorneys were fired for poor performance    Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue  along with other senior members of the Justice Department      The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter  but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas  invoking his right of executive privilege   Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice  The Justice Department determined that the President s order was legal     Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U S  Attorney positions for political advantage  no official findings have been released  On March 10  2008  the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas    On July 31  2008  a United States district court judge ruled that Bush s top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas     In all  twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress  They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales   and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson     Gonzales  liaison to the White House Monica Goodling     aide to the president Karl Rove   and his senior aide Sara M  Taylor     In addition  legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers   and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten   were both found in contempt of Congress      In 2010  the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings    the firings were  inappropriately political   but not criminal  According to the prosecutors  there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense     In July 2001  Bush visited Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo     During his Presidential campaign  Bush s foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America   especially Mexico   and a reduction of involvement in   nation building   and other small scale military engagements  The administration pursued a national missile defense     Bush was an advocate of China s entry into the World Trade Organization      In his 2002 State of the Union Address  Bush referred to an axis of evil including Iraq   Iran and North Korea     After the September 11 attacks on New York  Bush launched the War on Terror  in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan   In 2003  Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq   searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction  which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism    Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq   Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations  He appointed long time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign  Bush lauded the pro democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine    citation needed    In March 2006  a visit to India led to renewed ties between the two countries  reversing decades of U S  policy    The visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter terrorism cooperation  discussions that would lead eventually to the U S  India Civil Nuclear Agreement      This is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor  Clinton  whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring  The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush s tenure     Midway through Bush s second term  it was questioned whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda  highlighted in policy changes toward some oil rich former Soviet republics in central Asia     In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20  2001  Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks  He specifically thanked U K  Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington to show  unity of purpose with America   and said  America has no truer friend than Great Britain      The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush s presidency  That evening  he addressed the nation from the Oval Office   promising a strong response to the attacks  He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims  On September 14  he visited Ground Zero   meeting with Mayor Rudy Giuliani   firefighters  police officers  and volunteers  Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of rubble  to much applause   I can hear you  The rest of the world hears you  And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon      In a September 20 speech  Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al Qaeda   and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan  where bin Laden was operating  to  hand over the terrorists  or     share in their fate      After September 11  Bush announced a global War on Terror  The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with Osama bin Laden  so Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime    In his January 29  2002 State of the Union Address   he asserted that an   axis of evil   consisting of North Korea  Iran  and Iraq was  arming to threaten the peace of the world  and  pose d  a grave and growing danger     The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war   or preventive war     This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks     Dissent and criticism of Bush s leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued        In 2006  a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the   cause clbre for jihadists         On October 7  2001  U S  and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13  The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban   drive al Qaeda out of Afghanistan  and capture key al Qaeda leaders  In December 2001  the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated    but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al Qaeda leaders    Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai       In 2002  based on UNICEF figures  Nicholas Kristof reported that  our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade  as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid     Efforts to kill or capture al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora   which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U S  ground troops    It was not until May 2011  two years after Bush left office  that bin Laden was killed by U S  forces  Bin Laden s successor  Ayman al Zawahiri   as well as the leader of the Taliban  Mohammed Omar   remain at large   Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul  by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping  amassing new funds and recruits    The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned    In 2006  the Taliban insurgency appeared larger  fiercer and better organized than expected  with large scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success        As a result  Bush commissioned 3 500 additional troops to the country in March 2007     Beginning with his January 29  2002 State of the Union address   Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq  which he labeled as part of an   axis of evil   allied with terrorists and posing  a grave and growing danger  to U S  interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction        In the latter half of 2002  CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein  s intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs  not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons   and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions      Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq s weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president       In late 2002 and early 2003  Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates  precipitating a diplomatic crisis   In November 2002  Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq  but were advised by the U S  to depart the country four days prior to the U S  invasion  despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks    The U S  initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries     More than 20 nations  most notably the United Kingdom   designated the   coalition of the willing   joined the United States   in invading Iraq  They launched the invasion on March 20  2003  The Iraqi military was quickly defeated  The capital  Baghdad   fell on April 9  2003  On May 1  Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq  The initial success of U S  operations increased his popularity  but the U S  and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups  Bush s   Mission Accomplished   speech was later criticized as premature    From 2004 until 2007  the situation in Iraq deteriorated further  with some observers arguing that there was a full scale civil war in Iraq     Bush s policies met with criticism  including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq  The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group   led by James Baker   concluded that the situation in Iraq was  grave and deteriorating   While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq    he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy       In January 2005  free  democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years    According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al Rubaie    This is the greatest day in the history of this country     Bush praised the event as well  saying that the Iraqis  have taken rightful control of their country s destiny     This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as President and Nouri al Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq  A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005  supported by most Shiites and many Kurds      On January 10  2007  Bush announced a surge of 21 500 more troops for Iraq   as well as a job program for Iraqis  more reconstruction proposals  and  1 2billion for these programs    On May 1  2007  Bush used his second ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U S  troops    saying the debate over the conflict was  understandable  but insisting that a continued U S  presence there was crucial     In March 2008  Bush praised the Iraqi government s  bold decision  to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army   calling it  a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq     He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008  He also praised the Iraqis  legislative achievements  including a pension law  a revised de Baathification law  a new budget  an amnesty law  and a provincial powers measure that  he said  set the stage for the Iraqi elections     By July 2008  American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began    and due to increased stability in Iraq  Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces     Following the events of September 11  Bush issued an executive order authorizing the President s Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U S and parties within the U S  without obtaining a warrant as required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act     As of 2009  the other provisions of the program remained highly classified    Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war  the program was subsequently re authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists     The program proved to be controversial   as critics of the administration  as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association   argued that it was illegal    In August 2006  a U S  district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional    but on July 6  2007  that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing     On January 17  2007  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U S  Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President  but would be subjected to judicial oversight    Later in 2007  the NSA launched a replacement for the program  referred to as PRISM   that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court     This program was not publicly revealed until reports by the Washington Post   and The Guardian   emerged in June 2013     Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding as one of several enhanced interrogation techniques         Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques  such as waterboarding  to be legal based on a secret Justice Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions   ban on torture and Vice President Cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal      The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General  though that memo was later withdrawn    While not permitted by the U S  Army Field Manuals which assert  that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information     the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations  provided critical information  to preserve American lives    Critics  such as former CIA officer Bob Baer  have stated that information was suspect   you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture s bad enough      On October 17  2006  Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act of 2006     a law enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court s decision in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld   548 U S  557  2006     which allows the U S  government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial  The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees  but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture     On March 8  2008  Bush vetoed H R  2082    a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations   saying that  the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror     In April 2009  the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration s interrogation tactics    One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department     Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong il of North Korea  naming North Korea one of three states in an   axis of evil    and saying that  the United States of America will not permit the world s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world s most destructive weapons     Within months   both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U S  DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994      North Korea s October 9  2006  detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush s foreign policy  which centered for both terms of his presidency on   preventing  the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical  biological  or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world     Bush condemned North Korea s position  reaffirmed his commitment to  a nuclear free Korean Peninsula   and stated that  transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States   for which North Korea would be held accountable    On May 7  2007  North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account  This was a result of a series of three way talks initiated by the United States and including China    On September 2  2007  North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007    By May 2009  North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea     On June 22  2010   While South Korea prospers  the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly   he said  adding that   communism had resulted in dire poverty  mass starvation and brutal suppression   In recent years   he went on to say   the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea s precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs      Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria    In early 2007  the Treasury Department   acting on a June 2005 executive order   froze American bank accounts of Syria s Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology  Electronics Institute  and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory  Bush s order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction   and being supportive of terrorism    Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007  the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians  accusing them of activities to  undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon  in November 2007  Those designated included  Assaad Halim Hardan  a member of Lebanon s parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party  Wi am Wahhab  a former member of Lebanon s government  Minister of the Environment  under Prime Minister Omar Karami  20042005   Hafiz Makhluf  a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al Assad   and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik  identified as a close adviser to Assad     Bush initiated the President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Program  PEPFAR   The U S  government has spent some  44 billion on the project since 2003  a figure that includes  7 billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis  and Malaria  a multilateral organization     saving an estimated 5 million lives    According to New York Times correspondent Peter Baker    Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since      On May 10  2005  Vladimir Arutyunian   a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians   threw a live hand grenade toward a podium where Bush was speaking at Freedom Square in Tbilisi  Georgia  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby  It landed in the crowd about 65 feet  20m  from the podium after hitting a girl  but it did not detonate  Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005  confessed  was convicted and was given a life sentence in January 2006     Bush withdrew U S  support for several international agreements  including the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty  ABM  with Russia  He also signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia   Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence  but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas   Bush supported Sharon s unilateral disengagement plan  and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat s death   Bush also expressed U S  support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand off in April 2001 with the People s Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident   when an EP 3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People s Liberation Army Air Force jet  leading to the detention of U S  personnel  From 2003 to 2004  Bush authorized U S  military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U S  interests  Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide    Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur  but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court    In his State of the Union address in January 2003  Bush outlined a five year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief  the President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief   Bush announced  15billion for this effort   which directly supported life saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3 2 million men  women and children worldwide     On June 10  2007  he met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania    Bush has voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo    Bush opposed South Ossetia  s independence    On August 15  2008  Bush said of Russia s invasion of the country of Georgia    Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century      Bush opened the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City  Departing from previous practice  he stood among a group of U S  athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box  saying   On behalf of a proud  determined  and grateful nation  I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City  celebrating the Olympic Winter Games     In 2008  in the course of a good will trip to Asia  he attended the Summer Olympics in Beijing     Bush twice invoked Section 3 of the Twenty fifth Amendment   which allows a President to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the Vice President who then becomes Acting President   On June 29  2002  Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment  making Vice President Dick Cheney the Acting President  The medical procedure began at 7 09a m  EDT and ended at 7 29a m  EDT  Bush woke up twenty minutes later  but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9 24a m  EDT after the president s doctor  Richard Tubb   conducted an overall examination  Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects  On July 21  2007  Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy  again making Vice President Cheney the Acting President  Bush invoked Section 3 at 7 16a m  EDT  He reclaimed his powers at 9 21a m  EDT  In both cases  Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers     Following the announcement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O Connor  s retirement on July 1  2005  Bush nominated John Roberts to succeed her  On September 5  following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist   this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist  Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29  2005   On October 3  2005  Bush nominated long time White House Counsel Harriet Miers for O Connor s position  After facing significant opposition from both parties  who found her to be ill prepared and uninformed on the law    Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27  Four days later  on October 31  Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito   Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31  2006     In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments  Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts   Each of these numbers  along with his total of 324 judicial appointments  is third in American history  behind both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton   Bush experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies   Debate during one confirmation session lasted  39 stupefying hours  according to The New York Times   On August 3  2001  the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in status quo   returning 40 judicial nominations  and 164 total nominations         At the outset  Judicature magazine noted that the  Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings  before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate  It then cites the New York Times as saying  Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr  Bush s judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny      The Senate only confirmed 8 out of 60 judicial nominations by October 2001  In February 2003  the Democrats successfully filibustered the nomination of Miguel Estrada      Bush s upbringing in West Texas   his accent  his vacations on his Texas ranch  and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy  American cowboy image       I think people look at him and think John Wayne    said Piers Morgan   editor of the British Daily Mirror     It has been suggested that Bush s accent was an active choice  as a way of distinguishing himself from Northeastern intellectuals and anchoring himself to his Texas roots    Both supporters and detractors have pointed to his country persona as reasons for their support or criticism     Bush has been parodied by the media    comedians  and other politicians      Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches  which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms     Some pundits labeled Bush  the worst president ever             In contrast to his father  who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme  Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks    Tony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is  ludicrous  and that Bush is  very smart     In an interview with Playboy   New York Times columnist David Brooks said George W  Bush  was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public  He doesn t want anybody to think he s smarter than they are  so puts on a Texas act      Bush began his presidency with approval ratings near 50percent    After the September 11 attacks   Bush gained an approval rating of 90percent    maintaining 80 to 90percent approval for four months after the attacks  It remained over 50percent during most of his first term   and then fell to as low as 19percent in his second term     In 2000 and again in 2004  Time magazine named George W  Bush as its Person of the Year   a title awarded to someone who the editors believe  has done the most to influence the events of the year     In May 2004  Gallup reported that 89percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush    However  the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans  frustration with him on issues of spending  illegal immigration  and Middle Eastern affairs     Within the United States armed forces  according to an unscientific survey  the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections    While 73percent of military personnel said that they would vote for Bush  18percent preferred his Democratic rival  John Kerry     According to Peter D  Feaver   a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U S  military  members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq     Bush s approval rating went below the 50percent mark in AP   Ipsos polling in December 2004    Thereafter  his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped  Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War   his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse   NSA warrantless surveillance   the Plame affair   and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies    There were calls for Bush s impeachment   though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action    The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy    the Bush administration s justification for the war in Iraq    and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions     Representative Dennis Kucinich  D  OH    who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign  introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9  2008  but Speaker Nancy Pelosi  D  CA   declared that impeachment was  off the table      Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37percent approval ratings for Bush    the lowest for any second term president at that point of his term since Harry S  Truman in March 1951  when Truman s approval rating was 28percent       which contributed to what Bush called the  thumping  of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid term elections     Throughout most of 2007  Bush s approval rating hovered in the mid thirties    the average for his entire second term was 37percent  according to Gallup     By the beginning of 2008  his final year in office  Bush s approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19percent  largely from the loss of support among Republicans    Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being  the worst president       Bush would say   I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles  I frankly don t give a damn about the polls      In the spring of that year  Bush s disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70 year history of the Gallup poll   with 69percent of those polled in April 2008 disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28percent approvingalthough the majority  66percent  of Republicans still approved of his job performance     In polls conducted in the fall  just before the 2008 election  his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20percent      while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67percent to as high as 75percent      In polling conducted January 911  2009  his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34percent  which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry Truman   the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30 s   Richard Nixon  s final Gallup approval rating was even lower  at 24percent     According to a CBS News   New York Times poll conducted January 1115  2009  Bush s final approval rating in office was 22percent     Early in his presidency  following the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  he had achieved the highest job approval rating of any American president since World War II  at 90percent      but Bush left the White House as one of the most unpopular presidents  second in overall unpopularity only to Richard Nixon       Bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti war and anti globalization campaigns for his administration s foreign policy      Views of him within the international community were more negative than those of most previous American Presidents  even from close ally France     Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the UK and Vicente Fox of Mexico  although formal relations were sometimes strained        Other leaders  such as Afghan president Hamid Karzai     Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni     Spanish prime minister Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero     and Venezuelan president Hugo Chvez     openly criticized the president  Later in Bush s presidency  tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin   which led to a cooling of their relationship     In 2006  most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush  Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security      In 2007  the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency  attitudes towards the United States  and towards Americans  became less favorable around the world     A March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked leader in the Arab world     The Pew Research Center  s 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that out of 47 countries  in only nine countries did most respondents express  a lot of confidence  or  some confidence  in Bush  Ethiopia  Ghana  India  Israel  Ivory Coast  Kenya  Mali  Nigeria  and Uganda     During a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim   Albania   Bush was greeted enthusiastically  Albania has a population of 2 8million    has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan  and the country s government is highly supportive of American foreign policy    A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him      A shirt sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushe Kruje   a few kilometers northwest of Tirana     The Bush administration s support for the independence of Albanian majority Kosovo  while endearing him to the Albanians   has troubled U S  relations with Serbia  leading to the February 2008 torching of the U S  embassy in Belgrade      On May 7  2005  during an official state visit to Latvia  Bush was awarded the Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira V  e Freiberga     A few places outside the United States bear Bush s name  In 2005  the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street in honor of the U S  president    Previously known as Melaani Drive  the street links the Georgian capital s airport with the city center and was used by Bush s motorcade during his visit four months earlier    A street in Tirana   formerly known as Rruga Puntort e Rilendjes   situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament   was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007    In Jerusalem   a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush     In 2012  Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO     Following the inauguration of Barack Obama   Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland  Texas   following which they returned to their ranch in Crawford  Texas     They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas   Texas  where they settled down     He makes regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas Fort Worth area  most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys first game in the team s new stadium in Arlington   and an April 2009 visit to a Texas Rangers game  where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation    He also attended every home playoff game for the Texas Rangers 2010 season and  accompanied by his father  threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 2010 World Series on October 31  2010     On August 6  2013  Bush was successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent   The blockage had been found during an annual medical examination      Since leaving office  Bush has kept a relatively low profile   though he has made public appearances  most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011  In March 2009  he delivered his first post presidency speech in Calgary   Alberta      appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which he praised U S  troops for earning a  special place in American history     and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy     Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the  Get Motivated  seminar in Dallas    In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting that took place on November 5  2009  in Texas  the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and victims  families the day following the shooting  having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage     Bush released his memoirs  Decision Points   on November 9  2010  During a pre release appearance promoting the book  Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping  the country safe amid a real danger   and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of Social Security reform     He also made news defending his administration s enhanced interrogation techniques  specifically the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed   saying   I d do it again to save lives      In 2012  he wrote the foreword of The 4  Solution  Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs   an economics book published by the George W  Bush Presidential Center         He also presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas  Texas     Bush appeared on NBC  s The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19  2013  along with the former First Lady   When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration   Bush said   I don t think it s good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor     Despite this statement  on Saturday  April 25  2015  Bush criticized President Barack Obama at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas  Bush criticized Obama s handling of Iran  specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal  saying   You think the Middle East is chaotic now  Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren  Thats how Americans should view the deal   Bush also attacked Obama s withdrawal of U S  troops from Iraq in 2011  calling it a  strategic blunder   borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham      Alongside the 2014 United StatesAfrica Leaders Summit   Bush  Michelle Obama   the State Department  and the George W  Bush Institute hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit  Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV AIDS more difficult     Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries       On November 2  2014  Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W  Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming Museum of the Bible in Washington D C       Bush published a biography of his father  George H W  Bush   called 41  A Portrait of My Father   It was released on November 11  2014     In an interview published by Israel Hayom magazine on June 12  2015  Bush said that he thought you would  need boots on the ground  in order to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant  ISIS   He added that people had said during his Presidency that he should get out of Iraq  but he chose the opposite  sending 30 000 more troups in order to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq   and Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated  Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer  stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President Barack Obama      At President Obama s request  Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier in January     On May 2  2011  President Obama called Bush  who was at a restaurant with his wife  to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed     The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11  2001  terrorist attacks  At the Ground Zero memorial  Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War     After serving as president  Bush began painting as a hobby   Subjects have included dogs and still life     He has also painted self portraits and portraits of world leaders  including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair         His paintings have been met with a middling reception by art critics  Bill Arning  director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston   called his portraits  thickly painted in what I would call  high amateur  mode  and wrote   I would say they need to be less based on photographic reproduction  You can tell when someone is taking a found photograph and making a painting out of it       I think he d be well advised to work from other  multiple photographic sources or the real person to get a little bit more liveliness going on      George W  Bush s legacy remains a contested one  with both liberals and conservatives holding strong views on his overall place in history  Supporters credit Bush s counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring after 9 11 and also praise individual policies such as the No Child Left Behind Act   the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR   Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War   specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion as well as his handling of tax policy   Hurricane Katrina and the 2008 financial crisis as proof that George W  Bush was unfit to be president      The No Child Left Behind Act has also become an area of criticism in recent years  as many academics   who    have argued that states  increasing reliance on standardized testing which resulted from the legislation has worsened American education    citation needed    Despite the ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives  several historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history  Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush s presidency as a  transformative  one  and said that  some people hate him  some people love him  but I do think he ll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on     Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as  the most noteworthy president since FDR   and said that the Patriot Act  increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable  as evidence    Bush s administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration     and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society     Much of these policies has endured in the administration of Bush s Democratic successor  Barack Obama        Among the public  his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009  In February 2012  Gallup reported that  Americans still rate George W  Bush among the worst presidents  though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office     Gallup had earlier noted that Bush s favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office  from 40percent in January 2009 and 35percent in March 2009  to 45percent in July 2010  a period during which he had remained largely out of the news    Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush s personal favorability since the end of his presidency    In April 2013  Bush s approval rating stood at 47percent approval and 50percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for the Washington Post and ABC   his highest approval rating since December 2005  Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors  non college whites  and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office  although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy  53percent  and the Iraq War  57percent     His 47percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama s in the same polling period    A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55percent of Americans said Bush s presidency had been a failure  with 80percent of Republican calling it a success  but only 43percent of independents calling it a success and nearly 90percent of Democrats calling it a failure     While President Bush s approval rating among the public has seen an improvement  the most recent survey of the opinions of historians  political scientists  and Presidential scholars  conducted in 2010 by the Siena Research Institute   ranked him 39th out of 43 Presidents  The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U S  economy  communication  ability to compromise  foreign policy accomplishments  and

18811885   he succeeded James A  Garfield upon the latter s assassination   At the outset  Arthur struggled to overcome a slightly negative reputation  which stemmed from his early career in politics as part of New York s Republican political machine   He succeeded by embracing the cause of civil service reform  His advocacy for  and subsequent enforcement of  the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was the centerpiece of his administration   Arthur was born in Fairfield  Vermont   grew up in upstate New York   and practiced law in New York City  He served as quartermaster general in the New York Militia during the American Civil War   Following the war  he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in the political machine run by New York Senator Roscoe Conkling   Appointed by President Ulysses S  Grant to the lucrative and politically powerful post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871  Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party  In 1878 the new president  Rutherford B  Hayes   fired Arthur as part of a plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York  When Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880  Arthur  an eastern Stalwart  was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket    After just half a year as vice president  Arthur found himself in the executive mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor  To the surprise of reformers  Arthur took up the cause of reform  though it had once led to his expulsion from office  He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions  He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive  He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus  which had been accumulating since the end of the Civil War   Suffering from poor health  Arthur made only a limited effort to secure the Republican Party s nomination in 1884  he retired at the close of his term  Journalist Alexander McClure later wrote   No man ever entered the Presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur  and no one ever retired    more generally respected  alike by political friend and foe     Although his failing health and political temperament combined to make his administration less active than a modern presidency  he earned praise among contemporaries for his solid performance in office  The New York World summed up Arthur s presidency at his death in 1886   No duty was neglected in his administration  and no adventurous project alarmed the nation     Mark Twain wrote of him    I t would be hard indeed to better President Arthur s administration     Over the 20th and 21st centuries  however  Arthur s reputation mostly faded among the public  Although some have praised his economic policies  present day historians and scholars list him among the bottom half when ranking the American presidents     Chester Alan Arthur was born October5  1829  in Fairfield  Vermont     a   His father  William Arthur  was born just outside the village of Cullybackey   County Antrim   Ireland  now Northern Ireland    William Arthur emigrated to Dunham   Lower Canada    in present day Quebec   in 1818 or 1819  after graduating from Belfast College     Arthur s mother  Malvina Stone  was born in Vermont   the daughter of George Washington Stone and Judith Stevens  Malvina s family was primarily of English descent  and her grandfather  Uriah Stone  fought in the Continental Army during the American Revolution     Arthur s mother met his father while William Arthur was teaching at a school in Dunham  just over the border from her native Vermont  The two married in Dunham on April 12  1821  soon after meeting    After their first child  Regina  was born  the Arthurs moved to Vermont  They quickly moved from Burlington to Jericho   and finally to Waterville   as William received positions teaching at different schools    William Arthur also spent a brief time working to join the legal profession  While still in Waterville  William departed from his legal studies  as well as his Presbyterian upbringing  to join the Free Will Baptists   spending the rest of his life as a minister in that sect    William became an outspoken abolitionist  which often made him unpopular with members of his congregations and contributed to the family s frequent moves    In 1828  the family moved again  to Fairfield  where Chester Alan Arthur was born the following year  he was the fifth of nine children      He was named  Chester  after Chester Abell  the physician and family friend who assisted in his birth  and  Alan  for his paternal grandfather    b   The family remained in Fairfield until 1832  when William s profession took them on the road again  to several towns in Vermont and upstate New York  The family finally settled in the Schenectady  New York   area     The family s frequent moves later spawned accusations that Chester Arthur was not a native born citizen of the United States  When Arthur was nominated for vice president in 1880   a New York attorney and political opponent  Arthur P  Hinman  initially speculated that Arthur was born in Ireland and did not come to the United States until he was fourteen years old  Had that been true  opponents might have argued that Arthur was constitutionally ineligible for the vice presidency under the United States Constitution  s natural born citizen clause       c     When Hinman s original story did not take root  he spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada  This claim  too  failed to gain credence     Arthur spent some of his childhood years living in the New York towns of York   Perry   Greenwich   Schenectady   and Hoosick     One of his first teachers said Arthur was a boy  frank and open in manners and genial in disposition     During his time at school  he gained his first political inclinations and supported the Whig Party   He joined other young Whigs in support of Henry Clay   even participating in a brawl against students who supported James K  Polk     Arthur also supported the Fenian Brotherhood   an Irish republican organization founded in America  he showed this support by wearing a green coat    Arthur enrolled at Union College   in Schenectady  New York  in 1845  where he studied the traditional classical curriculum     As a senior   he was president of the debate society and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa     During his winter breaks  Arthur served as a teacher at a school in Schaghticoke      After graduating  Arthur returned to Schaghticoke and became a full time teacher  but soon began to pursue an education in the law    While studying law  he continued teaching  moving closer to home by taking a job at a school in North Pownal  Vermont     Coincidentally  future president James A  Garfield taught penmanship at the same school three years later  but the two did not cross paths during their teaching careers    In 1852  Arthur moved again  to Cohoes  New York   to become the principal of a school at which his sister  Malvina  was a teacher    In 1853  after studying at State and National Law School in Ballston Spa  New York   and then saving enough money to relocate  Arthur moved to New York City to read law at the law office of Erastus D  Culver   an abolitionist lawyer and family friend    When Arthur was admitted to the bar in 1854  he joined Culver s firm  which was subsequently renamed Culver  Parker  and Arthur     When Arthur joined the firm  Culver and New York attorney John Jay  the grandson of the Founding Father of the same name   were pursuing a habeas corpus action against Jonathan Lemmon  a Virginia slaveholder who was passing through New York with his eight slaves    In Lemmon v  New York   Culver argued that  as New York law did not permit slavery  any slave arriving in New York was automatically freed    The argument was successful  and after several appeals was upheld by the New York Court of Appeals in 1860    Campaign biographers would later give Arthur much of the credit for the victory  in fact his role was minor  although he was certainly an active participant in the case    In another civil rights case in 1854  Arthur was the lead attorney representing Elizabeth Jennings Graham after she was denied a seat on a streetcar because she was black    He won the case  and the verdict led to the desegregation of the New York City streetcar lines     In 1856  Arthur courted Ellen Herndon   the daughter of William Lewis Herndon   a Virginia naval officer    The two were soon engaged to be married    Later that year  he started a new law partnership with a friend  Henry D  Gardiner  and traveled with him to Kansas to consider purchasing land and setting up a law practice there    At that time  the state was the scene of a brutal struggle between pro slavery and anti slavery forces  and Arthur lined up firmly with the latter    The rough frontier life did not agree with the genteel New Yorkers  after three or four months the two young lawyers returned to New York City  where Arthur comforted his fiance after her father was lost at sea in the wreck of the SS Central America     In 1859  they were married at Calvary Episcopal Church in Manhattan    After his marriage  Arthur devoted his efforts to building his law practice  but also found time to engage in Republican party politics  He also indulged his military interest by becoming Judge Advocate General for the Second Brigade of the New York Militia     In 1860  Arthur was appointed to the military staff of Governor Edwin D  Morgan as engineer in chief    The office was a patronage appointment of minor importance until the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861  when New York and the other northern states were faced with raising and equipping armies of a size never before seen in American history    Arthur was given the rank of brigadier general and assigned to the quartermaster department    He was so efficient at housing and outfitting the troops that poured into New York City that he was promoted within the state militia to inspector general in February 1862  and then to quartermaster general that July    He had an opportunity to serve at the front when the 9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment elected him colonel early in the war  but at Governor Morgan s request  he turned it down to remain at his post in New York    He also turned down command of four New York City regiments organized as the Metropolitan Brigade  again at Morgan s request    The closest Arthur came to the front was when he traveled south to inspect New York troops near Fredericksburg   Virginia  in May 1862  shortly after forces under Major General Irwin McDowell seized the town during the Peninsula Campaign     That summer  he and other representatives of northern governors met with Secretary of State William H  Seward in New York to coordinate the raising of additional troops  and spent the next few months enlisting New York s quota of 120 000 men    Arthur received plaudits for his work  but his post was a political appointment  and he was relieved of his militia duties in January 1863 when Governor Horatio Seymour   a Democrat   took office     Arthur later joined the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States  MOLLUS  as a Third Class Companion  the honorary membership category for militia officers and civilians who made significant contributions to the war effort    In addition  Grand Army of the Republic posts in Ogdensburg  Wisconsin and Medford  Oregon were named in his honor       Arthur returned to his law practice in 1863 and  with the help of additional contacts made in the military  he and the firm of Arthur   Gardiner flourished    Even as his professional life improved  however  Arthur and his wife experienced a personal tragedy as their only child  William  died suddenly that year at the age of three    The couple took their son s death hard  and when they had another son  Chester Alan Jr   in 1864  they lavished attention on him    They also had a daughter  Ellen  in 1871  Both children survived to adulthood     Arthur s political prospects improved along with his law practice when his patron  ex Governor Morgan  was elected to the United States Senate     He was hired by Thomas Murphy   a Republican politician  but also a friend of William M  Tweed   the boss of the Tammany Hall Democratic organization  Murphy was also a hatter who sold goods to the Union Army  and Arthur represented him in Washington  The two became associates within New York Republican party circles  eventually rising in the ranks of the conservative branch of the party dominated by Thurlow Weed     In the presidential election of 1864   Arthur and Murphy raised funds from Republicans in New York and attended Abraham Lincoln  s inauguration in 1865      The end of the Civil War meant new opportunities for the men in Morgan s Republican machine   including Arthur    Morgan leaned toward the conservative wing of the New York Republican party  as did the men who worked for him  including Weed  Seward  who continued in office under President Andrew Johnson    and Roscoe Conkling  an eloquent Utica Congressman and rising star in the party     Arthur rarely articulated his own political ideas during his time as a part of the machine  as was common at the time  loyalty and hard work on the machine s behalf was more important than actual political sympathies     At the time  U S  Custom Houses were managed by political appointees who served as Collector  Naval Officer and Surveyor  In 1866  Arthur unsuccessfully attempted to secure the position of Naval Officer at the New York Custom House   a lucrative job subordinate only to the Collector    He continued his law practice  now a solo practitionership after Gardiner s death  and his role in politics  becoming a member of the prestigious Century Club in 1867    Conkling  elected in 1867 to the United States Senate  noticed Arthur and facilitated his rise in the party  and Arthur became chairman of the New York City Republican executive committee in 1868    His ascent in the party hierarchy kept him busy most nights  and his wife resented his continual absence from the family home on party business     Conkling s machine was solidly behind General Ulysses S  Grant s candidacy for president  and Arthur raised funds for Grant s election in 1868    The opposing Democratic machine in New York City  known as Tammany Hall   worked for Grant s opponent  former New York Governor Horatio Seymour  while Grant was victorious in the national vote  Seymour narrowly carried the state of New York    Arthur began to devote more of his time to politics and less to law  and in 1869 he became counsel to the New York City tax commission  appointed when Republicans controlled the state legislature  He remained at the job until 1870 at a salary of  10 000 a year      d   Arthur resigned after Democrats controlled by William M  Tweed of Tammany Hall won a legislative majority  which meant they could name their own appointee     Shortly thereafter  President Grant gave control over the New York Custom House patronage to Conkling  Having become friendly with Murphy over their shared love of horses  Grant appointed him to Collector s position    Murphy s reputation as a war profiteer and his association with Tammany Hall made him unacceptable to many of his own party  but Conkling convinced the Senate to confirm him    The Collector was responsible for hiring hundreds of workers to collect the tariffs due at the United States  busiest port  Typically  these jobs were dispensed to adherents of the political machine responsible for hiring the Collector  Employees were required to make political contributions  known as  assessments   back to the machine  which made the job a highly coveted political plum    Murphy s unpopularity only increased as he replaced workers loyal to Senator Reuben Fenton  s faction of the Republican party with those loyal to Conkling s    Eventually  the pressure to replace Murphy grew too great  and Grant asked for his resignation in 1871    Grant offered the position to John Ashley Griswold and William Orton   each of whom declined and recommended Arthur    Grant then nominated Arthur  with the New York Times commenting   his name very seldom rises to the surface of metropolitan life and yet moving like a mighty undercurrent this man during the last 10 years has done more to mold the course of the Republican Party in this state than any other one man in the country      The Senate confirmed Arthur s appointment  as Collector he controlled nearly a thousand jobs and received compensation as great as any federal officeholder    Arthur s salary was  6 500  but senior customs employees were compensated additionally by the  moiety  system  which awarded them a percentage of the fines levied on importers who attempted to evade the tariff    In total  his income came to more than  50 000more than the president s salary  and more than enough for him to enjoy fashionable clothes and a lavish lifestyle      e   Among those who dealt with the Custom House  Arthur was one of the era s more popular collectors    He got along with his subordinates and  since Murphy had already filled the staff with Conkling s adherents  he had few occasions to fire anyone    He was also popular within the Republican party as he efficiently collected campaign assessments from the staff and placed party leaders  friends in jobs as positions became available    Arthur had a better reputation than Murphy  but reformers still criticized the patronage structure and the moiety system as corrupt    A rising tide of reform within the party caused Arthur to rename the financial extractions from employees as  voluntary contributions  in 1872  but the concept remained  and the party reaped the benefit of controlling government jobs    In that year  reform minded Republicans formed the Liberal Republican party and voted against Grant  but he was re elected in spite of their opposition    Nevertheless  the movement for civil service reform continued to chip away at Conkling s patronage machine  in 1874 Custom House employees were found to have improperly assessed fines against an importing company as a way to increase their own incomes  and Congress reacted  repealing the moiety system and putting the staff  including Arthur  on regular salaries    As a result  his income dropped to  12 000 a year     Arthur s four year term expired on December10  1875  and Conkling  then among the most powerful politicians in Washington  arranged his protg s reappointment by President Grant    By 1876  Conkling was considering a run for the presidency himself  but the selection of reformer Rutherford B  Hayes by the 1876 Republican National Convention preempted the machine boss    Arthur and the machine gathered campaign funds with their usual zeal  but Conkling limited his own campaign activities to a few speeches    Hayes s opponent  New York Governor Samuel J  Tilden   carried New York and won the popular vote nationwide  but after the resolution of several months of disputes over twenty electoral votes  from the states of Florida  Louisiana  Oregon  and South Carolina   he lost the presidency     Hayes entered office with a pledge to reform the patronage system  in 1877  he and Treasury Secretary John Sherman made Conkling s machine the primary target    Sherman ordered a commission led by John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House    Jay  with whom Arthur had collaborated in the Lemmon case two decades earlier  suggested that the Custom House was overstaffed with political appointments  and that 20  of the employees were expendable    Sherman was less enthusiastic about the reforms than Hayes and Jay  but he approved the commission s report and ordered Arthur to make the personnel reductions    Arthur appointed a committee of Custom House workers to determine where the cuts were to be made and  after a written protest  carried them out    Notwithstanding his cooperation  the Jay Commission issued a second report critical of Arthur and other Custom House employees  and subsequent reports urging a complete reorganization     Hayes further struck at the heart of the spoils system by issuing an executive order that forbade assessments and barred federal office holders from  tak ing  part in the management of political organizations  caucuses  conventions  or election campaigns     Arthur and his subordinates  Naval Officer Alonzo B  Cornell and Surveyor George H  Sharpe   refused to obey the president s order  Sherman encouraged Arthur to resign  offering him appointment by Hayes to the consulship in Paris in exchange  but Arthur refused    In September 1877  Hayes demanded the three men s resignations  which they refused to give    Hayes then submitted the appointment of Theodore Roosevelt  Sr    L  Bradford Prince   and Edwin Merritt  all supporters of Conkling s rival William M  Evarts   to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements    The Senate s Commerce Committee  chaired by Conkling  unanimously rejected all the nominees  the full Senate rejected Roosevelt and Prince by a vote of 3125  and confirmed Merritt only because Sharpe s term had expired     Arthur s job was only spared until July 1878  when Hayes took advantage of a Congressional recess to fire him and Cornell  replacing them with the recess appointment of Merritt and Silas W  Burt       f   Hayes again offered Arthur the position of consul general in Paris as a face saving consolation  Arthur again declined  as Hayes knew he probably would    Conkling opposed the confirmation of Merritt and Burt when the Senate reconvened in February 1879  but Merritt was approved by a vote of 3125  as was Burt by 3119  giving Hayes his most significant civil service reform victory    Arthur immediately took advantage of the resulting free time to work for the election of Edward Cooper as New York City s next mayor    In the state elections of 1879  he and Conkling worked to ensure that the Republican nominees for state offices would be men of Conkling s faction  who had become known as Stalwarts    They were successful  but narrowly  as Cornell was nominated for governor by a vote of 234216    Arthur and Conkling campaigned vigorously for the Stalwart ticket and  owing partly to a splintering of the Democratic vote  were victorious    Arthur and the machine had rebuked Hayes and their intra party rivals  but Arthur had only a few days to enjoy his triumph when  on January12  1880  his wife died suddenly while he was in Albany organizing the political agenda for the coming year    Arthur felt devastated  and perhaps guilty  and never remarried     Conkling and his fellow Stalwarts  including Arthur  wished to follow up their 1879 success at the 1880 Republican National Convention by securing the nomination for their ally  ex President Grant    Their opponents in the Republican party  known as Half Breeds   concentrated their efforts on James G  Blaine   a Senator from Maine who was more amenable to civil service reform    Neither candidate commanded a majority of delegates and  deadlocked after thirty six ballots  the convention turned to a dark horse   James A  Garfield  an Ohio Congressman and Civil War General who was neither Stalwart nor Half Breed     Garfield and his supporters knew they would face a difficult election without the support of the New York Stalwarts and decided to offer one of them the vice presidential nomination    Levi P  Morton   the first choice of Garfield s supporters  consulted with Conkling  who advised him to decline  which he did    They next approached Arthur  and Conkling advised him to also reject the nomination  believing the Republicans would lose    Arthur thought otherwise and accepted  According to a purported eyewitness account by journalist William C  Hudson  Conkling and Arthur argued  with Arthur telling Conkling   The office of the Vice President is a greater honor than I ever dreamed of attaining       g   Conkling eventually relented  and campaigned for the ticket      As expected  the election was close  The Democratic nominee  General Winfield Scott Hancock   was popular and  having avoided taking definitive positions on most issues of the day  he had not offended any pivotal constituencies    As Republicans had done since the end of the Civil War  Garfield and Arthur initially focused their campaign on the   bloody shirt  the idea that returning Democrats to office would undo the victory of the Civil War and reward secessionists     With the war fifteen years in the past and Union generals at the head of both tickets  the tactic was less effective than the Republicans hoped    Realizing this  they adjusted their approach to claim that Democrats would lower the country s protective tariff   which would allow cheaper manufactured goods to be imported from Europe  and thereby put thousands out of work    This argument struck home in the swing states of New York and Indiana  where many were employed in manufacturing    Hancock did not help his own cause when  in an attempt to remain neutral on the tariff  he said that   t he tariff question is a local question   which only served to make him appear uninformed about an important issue    Candidates for high office did not personally campaign in those days  but Arthur played a part in the campaign in his usual fashion  raising money    The funds were crucial in the close election  and his home state of New York was crucial    The Republicans carried New York by 20 000 votes and  in an election with the largest turnout of qualified voters ever recorded78 4 they won the nationwide popular vote by just 7 018 votes    The electoral college result was more decisive214 to 155and Garfield and Arthur were elected     After the election  Arthur worked in vain to persuade Garfield to fill certain positions with his fellow New York Stalwartsespecially that of the Secretary of the Treasury  the Stalwart machine received a further rebuke when Garfield appointed Blaine  Conkling s arch enemy  as Secretary of State    The running mates  never close  detached as Garfield continued to freeze out the Stalwarts from his patronage  Arthur s status in the administration diminished when  a month before inauguration day  he gave a speech before reporters suggesting the election in Indiana  a swing state   had been won by illegal voting    Garfield ultimately appointed a Stalwart  Thomas Lemuel James   to be Postmaster General  but the cabinet fight and Arthur s ill considered speech left the President and Vice President clearly estranged when they took office on March4  1881     The Senate in the 47th United States Congress was divided among 37 Republicans  37 Democrats  one independent   David Davis   who caucused with the Democrats  one Readjuster   William Mahone    and four vacancies    Immediately  the Democrats attempted to organize the Senate  knowing that the vacancies would soon be filled by Republicans    As vice president  Arthur cast tie breaking votes in favor of the Republicans when Mahone opted to join their caucus    Even so  the Senate remained deadlocked for two months over Garfield s nominations because of Conkling s opposition to some of them    Just before going into recess in May 1881  the situation became more complicated when Conkling and the other Senator from New York  Thomas C  Platt   resigned in protest of Garfield s continuing opposition to their faction     With the Senate in recess  Arthur had no duties in Washington and returned to New York City    Once there  he traveled with Conkling to Albany   where the former Senator hoped for a quick re election to the Senate  and with it  a defeat for the Garfield administration      h   The Republican majority in the state legislature was divided on the question  to Conkling and Platt s surprise  and an intense campaign in the state house ensued      i    While in Albany on July 2  Arthur learned that Garfield had been shot    The assassin  Charles J  Guiteau   was a deranged office seeker who believed that Garfield s successor would appoint him to a patronage job  indeed  he proclaimed to onlookers   I am a Stalwart  and Arthur will be President     Despite claims to the contrary  Guiteau was proven mentally unstable and unconnected with the Vice President     More troubling was the lack of legal guidance on presidential succession   as Garfield lingered near death  no one was sure who  if anyone  could exercise presidential authority    Also  after Conkling s resignation  the Senate had adjourned without electing a president pro tempore   who would normally follow Arthur in the succession    Arthur was reluctant to be seen acting as president while Garfield lived  and for the next two months there was a void of authority in the executive office  with Garfield too weak to carry out his duties  and Arthur reluctant to assume them    Through the summer  Arthur refused to travel to Washington and was at his Lexington Avenue home when  on the night of September19  he learned that Garfield had died    Judge John R  Brady of the New York Supreme Court administered the oath of office in Arthur s home at 2 15a m  the following day  He boarded a train for the nation s capital two days later    Before leaving New York  he ensured the presidential line of succession by preparing and mailing to the White House a proclamation calling for a Senate special session  This step ensured that the Senate had legal authority to convene immediately and choose a Senate president pro tempore  who would be able to assume the presidency if Arthur died  Once in Washington he destroyed the mailed proclamation and issued a formal call for a special session     Arriving in Washington  D C  on September22  Arthur s oath of office was replicated  this time before Chief Justice Morrison R  Waite   to assure procedural compliance   He initially took up residence at the home of Senator John P  Jones   pending significant remodeling at the White House that he ordered  this included the addition of an elaborate fifty foot glass screen made by Louis Comfort Tiffany     His sister  Mary Arthur McElroy   served as White House hostess for her widowed brother    Arthur became Washington s most eligible bachelor and his social life became the subject of rumors  though romantically  he remained singularly devoted to the memory of his late wife    His son  Chester Jr   was then a freshman at Princeton University and his daughter  Nell  stayed in New York with a governess until 1882  when she arrived  Arthur shielded her from the intrusive press as much as he could     Arthur quickly came into conflict with Garfield s cabinet  most of whom represented his opposition within the party  He asked the cabinet members to remain until December  when Congress would reconvene  but Treasury Secretary William Windom submitted his resignation in October to enter a Senate race in his home state of Minnesota    Arthur replaced him with Charles J  Folger   his friend and fellow New York Stalwart    Attorney General Wayne MacVeagh was next to resign  believing that  as a reformer  he had no place in an Arthur cabinet    Despite Arthur s personal appeal to remain  MacVeagh resigned in December 1881 and Arthur replaced him with Benjamin H  Brewster   a Philadelphia lawyer and machine politician reputed to have reformist leanings    Blaine  nemesis of the Stalwart faction  remained Secretary of State until Congress reconvened  then departed immediately    Conkling expected Arthur to appoint him in Blaine s place  but the President chose Frederick T  Frelinghuysen of New Jersey  a Stalwart recommended by ex President Grant    Frelinghuysen advised Arthur not to fill any future vacancies with Stalwarts  but when Postmaster General James resigned in January 1882  Arthur selected Timothy O  Howe   a Wisconsin Stalwart    Navy Secretary William H  Hunt was next to resign  in April 1882  and Arthur attempted a more balanced approach by appointing William E  Chandler to the post  on Blaine s recommendation    Finally  when Interior Secretary Samuel J  Kirkwood resigned that same month  Arthur appointed Henry M  Teller   a Colorado Stalwart to the office    Of the Cabinet members Arthur had inherited from Garfield  only Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln remained for the entirety of Arthur s term     In the 1870s  a scandal was exposed  in which contractors for star postal routes were greatly overpaid for their services with the connivance of government officials  including Second Assistant Postal Secretary Thomas J  Brady and former Senator Stephen Wallace Dorsey      Reformers feared Arthur  as a former supporter of the spoils system  would not commit to continuing the investigation into the scandal    But Arthur s Attorney General  Brewster  did in fact continue the investigations begun by MacVeigh  and hired notable Democratic lawyers William W  Ker and Richard T  Merrick to strengthen the prosecution team and forestall the skeptics    Although Arthur had worked closely with Dorsey before his presidency  once in office he supported the investigation and forced the resignation of officials suspected in the scandal    An 1882 trial of the ringleaders resulted in convictions for two minor conspirators and a hung jury for the rest    After a juror came forward with allegations that the defendants attempted to bribe him  the judge set aside the guilty verdicts and granted a new trial    Before the second trial began  Arthur removed five federal office holders who were sympathetic with the defense  including a former Senator    The second trial began in December 1882 and lasted until July 1883 and  again  did not result in a guilty verdict    Failure to obtain a conviction tarnished the administration s image  but Arthur did succeed in putting a stop to the fraud     Garfield s assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the public demand for civil service reform    Both Democratic and Republican leaders realized that they could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system and  by 1882  a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform    In 1880  Democratic Senator George H  Pendleton of Ohio introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination     In his first annual presidential address to Congress in 1881  Arthur requested civil service reform legislation and Pendleton again introduced his bill  but Congress did not pass it    Republicans lost seats in the 1882 congressional elections  in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue    As a result  the lame duck session of Congress was more amenable to civil service reform  the Senate approved Pendleton s bill 385 and the House soon concurred by a vote of 15547    Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January16  1883    In just two years  time  an unrepentant Stalwart had become the president who ushered in long awaited civil service reform     At first  the act applied only to 10  of federal jobs and  without proper implementation by the president  it could have gone no further    Even after he signed the act into law  its proponents doubted Arthur s commitment to reform    To their surprise  he acted quickly to appoint the members of the Civil Service Commission that the law created  naming reformers Dorman Bridgeman Eaton   John Milton Gregory   and Leroy D  Thoman as commissioners    The chief examiner  Silas W  Burt   was a long time reformer who had been Arthur s opponent when the two men worked at the New York Customs House    The commission issued its first rules in May 1883  by 1884  half of all postal officials and three quarters of the Customs Service jobs were to be awarded by merit    That year  Arthur expressed satisfaction with the new system  praising its effectiveness  in securing competent and faithful public servants and in protecting the appointing officers of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public employment      With high revenue held over from wartime taxes  the federal government had collected more than it spent since 1866  by 1882 the surplus reached  145 million    Opinions varied on how to balance the budget   the Democrats wished to lower tariffs  in order to reduce revenues and the cost of imported goods  while Republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining  They preferred the government spend more on internal improvements and reduce excise taxes    Arthur agreed with his party  and in 1882 called for the abolition of excise taxes on everything except liquor  as well as a simplification of the complex tariff structure    In May of that year  Representative William D  Kelley of Pennsylvania introduced a bill to establish a tariff commission    the bill passed and Arthur signed it into law but appointed mostly protectionists to the committee  Republicans were pleased with the committee s make up but were surprised when  in December 1882  they submitted a report to Congress calling for tariff cuts averaging between 20 and 25   The commission s recommendations were ignored  however  as the House Ways and Means Committee   dominated by protectionists  provided a 10  reduction    After conference with the Senate  the bill that emerged only reduced tariffs by an average of 1 47   The bill passed both houses narrowly on March3  1883  the last full day of the 47th Congress  Arthur signed the measure into law  with no effect on the surplus     Congress attempted to balance the budget from the other side of the ledger  with increased spending on the 1882 Rivers and Harbors Act in the unprecedented amount of  19 million    While Arthur was not opposed to internal improvements  the scale of the bill disturbed him  as did its narrow focus on  particular localities   rather than projects that benefited a larger part of the nation    On August1  1882  Arthur vetoed the bill to widespread popular acclaim    in his veto message  his principal objection was that it appropriated funds for purposes  not for the common defense or general welfare  and which do not promote commerce among the States     Congress overrode his veto the next day   and the new law reduced the surplus by  19 million  Republicans considered the law a success at the time  but later concluded that it contributed to their loss of seats in the elections of 1882     During the Garfield administration   Secretary of State James G  Blaine attempted to invigorate United States diplomacy in Latin America  urging reciprocal trade agreements and offering to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations    Blaine  venturing a greater involvement in affairs south of the Rio Grande  proposed a Pan American conference in 1882 to discuss trade and an end to the War of the Pacific being fought by Bolivia   Chile  and Peru     Blaine did not remain in office long enough to see the effort through  and when Frederick T  Frelinghuysen replaced him at the end of 1881  the conference efforts lapsed    Frelinghuysen also discontinued Blaine s peace efforts in the War of the Pacific  fearing that the United States might be drawn into the conflict    Arthur and Frelinghuysen continued Blaine s efforts to encourage trade among the nations of the Western Hemisphere  a treaty with Mexico providing for reciprocal tariff reductions was signed in 1882 and approved by the Senate in 1884    Legislation required to bring the treaty into force failed in the House  however  rendering it a dead letter     Similar efforts at reciprocal trade treaties with Santo Domingo and Spain s American colonies were defeated by February 1885  and an existing reciprocity treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii was allowed to lapse     The 47th Congress spent a great deal of time on immigration  and at times was in accord with Arthur    In July 1882 Congress easily passed a bill regulating steamships that carried immigrants to the United States    To their surprise  Arthur vetoed it and requested revisions  which they made and which Arthur then approved    He also signed in August of that year the Immigration Act of 1882   which levied a 50 cent tax on immigrants to the United States  and excluded from entry the mentally ill   the intellectually disabled   criminals  or any other person potentially dependent upon public assistance     A more contentious debate materialized over the status of Chinese immigrants  in January 1868  the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China  allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese into the country  As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873   Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen s wages  in reaction Congress in 1879 attempted to abrogate the 1868 treaty by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act  but President Hayes vetoed it    Three years later  after China had agreed to treaty revisions  Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants  Senator John F  Miller of California introduced another Chinese Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty year period    The bill passed the Senate and House by overwhelming margins  but this as well was vetoed by Arthur  who concluded the 20 year ban to be a breach of the renegotiated treaty of 1880  That treaty allowed only a  reasonable  suspension of immigration  Eastern newspapers praised the veto  while it was condemned in the Western states  Congress was unable to override the veto  but passed a new bill reducing the immigration ban to ten years  Although he still objected to this denial of citizenship to Chinese immigrants  Arthur acceded to the compromise measure  signing the Chinese Exclusion Act into law on May6  1882      j    In the years following the Civil War  American naval power declined precipitously  shrinking from nearly 700 vessels to just 52  most of which were obsolete    The nation s military focus over the fifteen years before Garfield and Arthur s election had been on the Indian wars in the West  rather than the high seas  but as the region was increasingly pacified  many in Congress grew concerned at the poor state of the Navy    Garfield s Secretary of the Navy  William H  Hunt   advocated reform of the Navy and his successor  William E  Chandler   appointed an advisory board to prepare a report on modernization    Based on the suggestions in the report  Congress appropriated funds for the construction of three steel protected cruisers   Atlanta   Boston   and Chicago   and an armed dispatch steamer   Dolphin    collectively known as the  ABCD Ships  or the   Squadron of Evolution      Congress also approved funds to rebuild four monitors   Puritan   Amphitrite   Monadnock   and Terror     which had lain uncompleted since 1877    The contracts to build the ABCD ships were all awarded to the low bidder  John Roach   Sons of Chester   Pennsylvania    even though Roach once employed Secretary Chandler as a lobbyist    Democrats turned against the  New Navy  projects and  when they won control of the 48th Congress   refused to appropriate funds for seven more steel warships    Even without the additional ships  the state of the Navy improved when  after several construction delays  the last of the new ships entered service in 1889     Like his Republican predecessors  Arthur struggled with the question of how his party was to challenge the Democrats in the South and how  if at all  to protect the civil rights of black southerners    Since the end of Reconstruction   conservative white Democrats  or   Bourbon Democrats    had regained power in the South  and the Republican party dwindled rapidly as their primary supporters in the region  blacks  were disenfranchised     One crack in the solidly Democratic South emerged with the growth of a new party  the Readjusters   in Virginia    Having won an election in that state on a platform of more education funding  for black and white schools alike  and abolition of the poll tax and the whipping post   many northern Republicans saw the Readjusters as a more viable ally in the South than the moribund southern Republican party    Arthur agreed  and directed the federal patronage in Virginia through the Readjusters rather than the Republicans    He followed the same pattern in other Southern states  forging coalitions with independents and Greenback Party members    Some black Republicans felt betrayed by the pragmatic gambit  but others  including Frederick Douglass and ex Senator Blanche K  Bruce   endorsed the administration s actions  as the Southern independents had more liberal racial policies than the Democrats    Arthur s coalition policy was only successful in Virginia  however  and by 1885 the Readjuster movement began to collapse with the election of a Democratic president     Other federal action on behalf of blacks was equally ineffective  when the Supreme Court struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in an 1883 decision   Arthur expressed his disagreement with the decision in a message to Congress  but was unable to persuade Congress to pass any new legislation in its place    Arthur did  however  effectively intervene to overturn a court martial ruling against a black West Point cadet  Johnson Whittaker   after the Judge Advocate General of the Army   David G  Swaim   found the prosecution s case against Whittaker to be illegal and based on racism    The administration faced a different challenge in the West  where the LDS Church was under government pressure to stop the practice of polygamy in Utah Territory     Garfield had believed polygamy was criminal behavior and was morally detrimental to family values  and Arthur s views were  for once  in line with his predecessor s    In 1882  he signed the Edmunds Act into law  the legislation made polygamy a federal crime  barring polygamists both from public office and the right to vote     The Arthur administration was challenged by changing relations with western American Indian tribes    The Indian Wars were winding down  and public sentiment was shifting toward more favorable treatment of Native Americans  Arthur urged Congress to increase funding for Indian education  which it did in 1884  although not to the extent he wished    He also favored a move to the allotment system   under which individual Native Americans  rather than tribes  would own land  Arthur was unable to convince Congress to adopt the idea during his administration but  in 1887  the Dawes Act changed the law to favor such a system    The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time  but eventually proved detrimental to Native Americans as most of their land was resold at low prices to white speculators     During Arthur s presidency  settlers and cattle ranchers continued to encroach on Indian territory    Arthur initially resisted their efforts  but after Secretary of the Interior Henry M  Teller   an opponent of allotment  assured him that the lands were not protected  Arthur opened up the Crow Creek Reservation in the Dakota Territory to settlers by executive order in 1885    Arthur s successor  Grover Cleveland   finding that title belonged to the Indians  revoked Arthur s order a few months later     Shortly after becoming president  Arthur was diagnosed with Bright s disease   a kidney ailment now referred to as nephritis     He attempted to keep his condition private  but by 1883 rumors of his illness began to circulate  he had become thinner and more aged in appearance  and struggled to keep the pace of the presidency    To rejuvenate his health outside the confines of Washington  Arthur and some political friends traveled to Florida in April 1883    The vacation had the opposite effect  and Arthur suffered from intense pain before returning to Washington    Later that year  on the advice of Missouri Senator George Graham Vest   he visited Yellowstone National Park     Reporters accompanied the presidential party  helping to publicize the new National Park system     The Yellowstone trip was more beneficial to Arthur s health than his Florida excursion  and he returned to Washington refreshed after two months of travel     As the 1884 presidential election approached  James G  Blaine was considered the favorite for the Republican nomination  but Arthur  too  contemplated a run for a full term as president    In the months leading up to the 1884 Republican National Convention   however  Arthur began to realize that neither faction of the Republican party was prepared to give him their full support  the Half Breeds were again solidly behind Blaine  while Stalwarts were undecided  some backed Arthur  with others considering Senator John A  Logan of Illinois    Reform minded Republicans  friendlier to Arthur after he endorsed civil service reform  were still not certain enough of his reform credentials to back him over Senator George F  Edmunds of Vermont  who had long favored their cause    Business leaders supported him  as did Southern Republicans who owed their jobs to his control of the patronage  but by the time they began to rally around him  Arthur had decided against a serious campaign for the nomination    He kept up a token effort  believing that to drop out would cast doubt on his actions in office and raise questions about his health  but by the time the convention began in June  his defeat was assured    Blaine led on the first ballot  and by the fourth ballot he had a majority    Arthur telegraphed his congratulations to Blaine and accepted his defeat with equanimity    He played no role in the 1884 campaign  which Blaine would later blame for his loss that November to the Democratic nominee  Grover Cleveland     Arthur made appointments to fill two vacancies on the United States Supreme Court   The first vacancy arose in July 1881 with the death of Associate Justice Nathan Clifford   a Democrat who had been a member of the Court since before the Civil War    Arthur nominated Horace Gray   a distinguished jurist from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to replace him  and the nomination was easily confirmed    The second vacancy occurred when Associate Justice Ward Hunt retired in January 1882  Arthur first nominated his old political boss  Roscoe Conkling   he doubted that Conkling would accept  but felt obligated to offer a high office to his former patron    The Senate confirmed the nomination but  as expected  Conkling declined it    the last time a confirmed nominee declined his appointment    Senator George Edmunds was Arthur s next choice  but he declined to be considered    Instead  Arthur nominated Samuel Blatchford   who had been a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for the prior four years    Blatchford accepted  and his nomination was approved within two weeks    Blatchford served on the Court until his death in 1893     Arthur left office in 1885 and returned to his New York City home  Two months before the end of his term  several New York Stalwarts approached him to request that he run for United States Senate  but he declined  preferring to return to his old law practice at Arthur  Knevals   Ransom    His health limited his activity with the firm  and Arthur served only of counsel   He took on few assignments with the firm and was often too ill to leave his house    He managed a few public appearances  until the end of 1885     After summering in New London  Connecticut   in 1886  he returned quite ill and  on November16  ordered nearly all of his papers  both personal and official  burned      k   The next morning  Arthur suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and never regained consciousness  he died the following day at the age of 57    On November22  a private funeral was held at the Church of the Heavenly Rest in New York City  attended by President Cleveland and ex President Hayes  among other notables    Arthur was buried with his family members and ancestors in the Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands  New York   He was laid beside his wife in a sarcophagus on a large corner of the plot    In 1889  a monument was placed on Arthur s burial plot by sculptor Ephraim Keyser of New York  consisting of a giant bronze female angel figure placing a bronze palm leaf on a granite sarcophagus     In 1898  the Arthur memorial statuea fifteen foot  bronze figure of Arthur standing on a Barre Granite pedestalwas created by sculptor George Edwin Bissell and installed at Madison Square   in New York City    The statue was dedicated in 1899 and unveiled by Arthur s sister  Mary Arthur McElroy    At the dedication  Secretary of War Elihu Root described Arthur as  wise in statesmanship and firm and effective in administration   while acknowledging that Arthur was isolated in office and unloved by his own party     Arthur s unpopularity in life carried over into his assessment by historians  and his reputation after leaving office disappeared    By 1935  historian George F  Howe said that Arthur had achieved  an obscurity in strange contrast to his significant part in American history     By 1975  however  Thomas C  Reeves would write that Arthur s  appointments  if unspectacular  were unusually sound  the corruption and scandal that dominated business and politics of the period did not tarnish his administration     As 2004 biographer Zachary Karabell wrote  although Arthur was  physically stretched and emotionally strained  he strove to

States  Assassination and legacy   John Fitzgerald   Jack   Kennedy  May 29  1917  November 22  1963   commonly referred to by his initials JFK   was an American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963  The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty   the establishment of the Peace Corps   developments in the Space Race   the building of the Berlin Wall   the Civil Rights Movement   and increased U S  involvement in the Vietnam War all took place during his presidency   Kennedy s time in office is also marked by high tensions with communist states  and Cuba in particular  An attempt in April 1961 to overthrow the country s dictator  Fidel Castro   was thwarted by armed forces within three days  His administration subsequently rejected plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate false flag attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba   In October 1962  it was discovered Soviet ballistic missiles had been deployed in Cuba  the resulting period of unease  often termed the Cuban Missile Crisis   is seen by many historians as the closest the human race has ever come to nuclear war    After military service as commander of PT boats PT 109 and PT 59 during World War II in the South Pacific   Kennedy represented Massachusetts s 11th congressional district in the U S  House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat   Thereafter  he served in the U S  Senate from that state from 1953 until 1960  Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U S  Presidential Election   At age 43  he was the youngest man to have been elected to the office      a   the second youngest president  after Theodore Roosevelt   who was 42 when he became president after the assassination of William McKinley    Kennedy was the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president    To date  update    Kennedy has been the only Roman Catholic president and the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize      Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas   Texas on November 22  1963  Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested that afternoon and charged with the crime that night  Jack Ruby shot and killed Oswald two days later  before Oswald could be prosecuted  The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin  The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations  HSCA  agreed with the conclusion that Oswald fired the shots that killed the president  but also concluded that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy      Since the 1960s  information concerning Kennedy s private life has come to light  Details of Kennedy s health problems with which he struggled have become better known  especially since the 1990s  Although initially kept secret from the general public  reports of Kennedy being unfaithful in marriage have garnered much press  Kennedy ranks highly in historians  polls of U S  presidents   although a slight gap exists between his public reputation and his standing among academics    with the public generally more commendatory     John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born at 83 Beals Street in Brookline  Massachusetts   on May 29  1917    to businessman politician Joseph Patrick  Joe  Kennedy  Sr   18881969  and philanthropist socialite Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy  18901995   His father was the oldest son of businessman politician Patrick Joseph  P  J   Kennedy  18581929  and Mary Augusta Hickey Kennedy  18571923   His mother was the daughter of Boston Mayor John Francis  Honey Fitz  Fitzgerald  18631950  and Mary Josephine  Josie  Hannon Fitzgerald  18651964   All four of his grandparents were the children of immigrants from Ireland      His brothers were Joseph Patrick  Joe  Kennedy  Jr   19151944   Robert Francis  Bobby  Kennedy  19251968   and Edward Moore  Ted  Kennedy  19322009   Joseph Jr  was killed in action during World War II  Robert was JFK s attorney general and then a senator  Ted was a long serving senator from 1962 until his death in 2009  His sisters were Rose Marie  Rosemary  Kennedy  19182005   Kathleen Agnes  Kick  Kennedy  19201948   Eunice Mary Kennedy  19212009   Patricia Helen  Pat  Kennedy  19242006   and Jean Ann Kennedy  born 1928    Kennedy lived in Brookline for 10 years and attended the Edward Devotion School   the Noble and Greenough Lower School   and the Dexter School through 4th grade  In 1927  the Kennedy family moved to a stately twenty room Georgian style mansion at 5040 Independence Avenue  across the street from Wave Hill   in the Hudson Hill neighborhood of Riverdale  Bronx   New York City  Kennedy attended the Riverdale Country School   a private school for boys  from 5th to 7th grade  Two years later  the family moved to 294 Pondfield Road in the New York City suburb of Bronxville  New York   where Kennedy was a member of Scout Troop 2    The Kennedy family spent summers at their home in Hyannisport  Massachusetts and Christmas and Easter holidays at their winter home in Palm Beach  Florida   In September 1930  Kennedynow 13 years oldattended the Canterbury School in New Milford  Connecticut   In late April 1931  he required an appendectomy   after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home     In September 1931  Kennedy was sent to the The Choate School in Wallingford  Connecticut for 9th through 12th grade  His older brother had already been at Choate for two years as a football player and leading student  He spent his first years at Choate in his older brother s shadow  and compensated for this with rebellious behavior which attracted a coterie  Their most notorious stunt was to explode a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker  In the ensuing chapel assembly  the strict headmaster George St  John brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain  muckers  who would  spit in our sea   The defiant Kennedy took the cue and named his group The Muckers Club   which included roommate and friend Kirk LeMoyne  Lem  Billings      During his Choate years  Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated in 1934 with his emergency hospitalization at Yale New Haven Hospital where doctors thought he might have leukemia    In June 1934  he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  Minnesota   the ultimate diagnosis there was colitis     Kennedy graduated from Choate in June of the following year  For the school yearbook  of which he had been business manager  Kennedy was voted the  most likely to succeed      In September 1935  he made his first trip abroad with his parents and his sister Kathleen to London with the intent of studying under Harold Laski at the London School of Economics  LSE  as his older brother had done  Ill health forced his return to America in October of that year  when he enrolled late and spent six weeks at Princeton University   He was then hospitalized for observation at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston  He convalesced further at the Kennedy winter home in Palm Beach  then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand on the 40 000 acres  160km 2    Jay Six  cattle ranch outside Benson  Arizona     It is reported that ranchman Jack Speiden worked both brothers  very hard    In September 1936  Kennedy enrolled at Harvard College   where he produced that year s annual  Freshman Smoker   called by a reviewer  an elaborate entertainment  which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio  screen and sports world     He tried out for the football  golf  and swimming teams and earned a spot on the varsity swimming team    Kennedy also sailed in the Star class and won the 1936 Nantucket Sound Star Championship    In July 1937  Kennedy sailed to Francebringing his convertibleand spent ten weeks driving through Europe with Billings    In June 1938  Kennedy sailed overseas with his father and older brother to work at the American embassy in London where his father was President Franklin D  Roosevelt  s U S  Ambassador to the Court of St  James s      In 1939  Kennedy toured Europe  the Soviet Union   the Balkans   and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis  He then went to Czechoslovakia and Germany before returning to London on September 1  1939  that was the day Germany invaded Poland   Two days later  the family was in the House of Commons for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom s declaration of war on Germany  Kennedy was sent as his father s representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of the SS Athenia before flying back to the U S  from Foynes  Ireland to Port Washington  New York on his first transatlantic flight   As an upperclassman at Harvard  Kennedy became a more serious student and developed an interest in political philosophy  In his junior year  he made the Dean s List     In 1940  Kennedy completed his thesis   Appeasement in Munich   about British participation in the Munich Agreement   The thesis became a bestseller under the title Why England Slept     He graduated from Harvard College with a Bachelor of Science cum laude in international affairs that year  Kennedy enrolled in and audited classes at the Stanford Graduate School of Business that fall    In early 1941  he helped his father write a memoir of his three years as an American ambassador and then traveled throughout South America     On September 12  1953  Kennedy married Jacqueline Bouvier at St  Mary s Church in Newport  Rhode Island after a one year courtship     In September 1941  after medical disqualification by the Army for his chronic lower back problems  Kennedy joined the U S  Navy   with the influence of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence   former naval attach to Joseph Kennedy    Kennedy was an ensign serving in the office of the Secretary of the Navy when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred  He attended the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps and then voluntarily entered the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville  Rhode Island    His first command was PT 101   from December 7  1942 until February 23  1943  It was a PT boat used for training while Kennedy was an instructor at Melville    He then led three Huckins PT boats  PT 98   PT 99   and PT 101   which were being relocated from MTBRON 4 in Melville  Rhode Island  back to Jacksonville  Florida and the new MTBRON 14  formed February 17  1943   During the transit South  he was briefly hospitalized in Jacksonville after diving in the cold water to unfoul a propeller  Thereafter  he was assigned duty in Panama and later in the Pacific theater   where Kennedy earned the rank of lieutenant  eventually commanding two more patrol torpedo  PT  boats      On August 2  1943  Kennedy s boat  the PT 109   along with the PT 162 and the PT 169   was performing nighttime patrols near New Georgia in the Solomon Islands     when PT 109 was rammed by the Japanese destroyer Amagiri     Kennedy gathered his surviving crew members together in the water around the wreckage  to vote on whether to  fight or surrender   Kennedy stated   There s nothing in the book about a situation like this  A lot of you men have families and some of you have children  What do you want to do  I have nothing to lose   Shunning surrender  the men swam towards a small island     Kennedy  despite re injury to his back in the collision  towed a badly burned crewman through the water with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth    He towed the wounded man to the island  and later to a second island  from where his crew was subsequently rescued    For these actions  Kennedy received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal with the following citation   For extremely heroic conduct as Commanding Officer of Motor Torpedo Boat 109 following the collision and sinking of that vessel in the Pacific War Theater on August 12  1943  Unmindful of personal danger  Lieutenant  then Lieutenant  Junior Grade   Kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations  swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore  His outstanding courage  endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service   In October 1943  Kennedy took command of a PT boat converted into a gunboat  PT 59   which took part in a Marine rescue on Choiseul Island that November    Kennedy then left the PT 59 and returned to the United States in early January 1944  After receiving treatment for his back injury  he was released from active duty in late 1944     Beginning in January 1945  Kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at Castle Hot Springs   a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona       Kennedy was honorably discharged just prior to Japan s surrender in 1945  Kennedy s other decorations in World War II included the Purple Heart   American Defense Service Medal   American Campaign Medal   Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with three bronze service stars   and the World War II Victory Medal     When later asked how he became a war hero  Kennedy joked   It was easy  They cut my PT boat in half      In April 1945  Kennedy s father  who was a friend of William Randolph Hearst   arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers   the assignment kept Kennedy s name in the public eye and  expose d  him to journalism as a possible career     He worked as a correspondent that May  covering the Potsdam Conference and other events     While Kennedy was still serving  his older brother  Joe Jr  was killed in action over the English Channel during World War II  Because his eldest brother had been the family s political standard bearer and tapped by his father to seek the Presidency  his death changed that course and the task now fell to Kennedy     In 1946  U S  Representative James Michael Curley vacated his seat in the strongly Democratic 11th Congressional district in Massachusettsat the urging of Kennedy s fatherto become mayor of Boston  Kennedy ran for the seat  beating his Republican opponent by a large margin in November 1946    He served as a congressman for six years   In the 1952 U S  Senate election   Kennedy defeated incumbent Republican Henry Cabot Lodge II for the U S  Senate seat  The following year  he married Jacqueline Bouvier      Kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years  Often absent from the Senate  he was at times critically ill and received Catholic last rites   During his convalescence in 1956  he published Profiles in Courage   a book about U S  Senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs  for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957    Rumors that this work was co written by his close adviser and speechwriter   Ted Sorensen   were confirmed in Sorensen s 2008 autobiography     At the 1956 Democratic National Convention   Presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson let the convention select the Vice Presential nominee  Kennedy finished second in the balloting  losing to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee  Kennedy received national exposure from that episode  his father thought it just as well that Kennedy lost  due to the potential political debility of his Catholicism and the strength of the Eisenhower ticket   One of the matters demanding Kennedy s attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower s bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957     Kennedy cast a procedural vote on this  which was considered by some as an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill    Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act  which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin  but Majority Leader Lyndon B  Johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure    Kennedy also voted for Title IV  termed the  Jury Trial Amendment   Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act    A final compromise bill  which Kennedy supported  was passed in September 1957     In 1958  Kennedy was re elected to a second term in the Senate  defeating his Republican opponent  Boston lawyer Vincent J  Celeste  by a wide margin  It was during his re election campaign that Kennedy s press secretary at this time  Robert E  Thompson   put together a film entitled The U S  Senator John F  Kennedy Story   which exhibited a day in the life of the Senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office  It was the most comprehensive film produced about Kennedy up to that time     While Kennedy s father was a strong supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy   McCarthy was also a friend of the Kennedy family  As well  Bobby Kennedy worked for McCarthy s subcommittee  and McCarthy dated Kennedy sister Patricia  In 1954  the Senate voted to censure McCarthy and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure  The speech  however  was not delivered  because of Kennedy s hospitalization at the time  The speech had the potential of putting Kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by  pairing  his vote against that of another senator  Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted  the episode damaged Kennedy s support among members of the liberal community  including Eleanor Roosevelt   in the 1956 and 1960 elections     On January 2  1960  Kennedy initiated his campaign for president in the Democratic primary election   where he faced challenges from Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota and Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon   Kennedy defeated Humphrey in Wisconsin and West Virginia   Morse in Maryland and Oregon  as well as token opposition  often write in candidates   in New Hampshire   Indiana   and Nebraska    Kennedy visited a coal mine in West Virginia  Most miners and others in that predominantly conservative   Protestant state were quite wary of Kennedy s Roman Catholicism  His victory in West Virginia confirmed his broad popular appeal   At the Democratic Convention  he gave his well known   New Frontier   speech  saying   For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all wonand we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier      But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promisesit is a set of challenges  It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people  but what I intend to ask of them      With Humphrey and Morse eliminated  Kennedy s main opponent at the Los Angeles convention was Senator Lyndon B  Johnson of Texas  Kennedy overcame this formal challenge as well as informal ones from Adlai Stevenson  the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956   Stuart Symington   and several favorite sons   and on July 13 the Democratic convention nominated Kennedy as its candidate  Kennedy asked Johnson to be his vice presidential candidate  despite opposition from many liberal delegates and Kennedy s own staff  including his brother Bobby     Kennedy needed Johnson s strength in the South to win what was considered likely to be the closest election since 1916   Major issues included how to get the economy moving again  Kennedy s Roman Catholicism  Cuba   and whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the U S  To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision making  he famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12  1960   I am not the Catholic candidate for president  I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic  I do not speak for my Church on public matters and the Church does not speak for me     Kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one quarter of Americans were relegated to second class citizenship just because they were Catholic  and once stated that   No one asked me my religion  serving the Navy  in the South Pacific      During the campaign  Kennedy sought a meeting with Rabbi Menachem M  Schneerson   at his office on Brooklyn  Kennedy was turned down as the rabbi was already meeting a group of simple men and women that evening       In September and October  Kennedy appeared with Republican candidate Richard Nixon   then vice president  in the first televised U S  presidential debates in U S  history  During these programs  Nixon  with a sore injured leg and his   five o clock shadow    was perspiring and looked tense and uncomfortable  while Kennedy  choosing to avail himself of makeup services  appeared relaxed  leading the huge television audience to favor Kennedy as the winner  Radio listeners either thought Nixon had won or that the debates were a draw    The debates are now considered a milestone in American political historythe point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics     Kennedy s campaign gained momentum after the first debate  and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls  On November 8  Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century  In the national popular vote Kennedy led Nixon by just two tenths of one percent  49 7  to 49 5    while in the Electoral College he won 303 votes to Nixon s 219  269 were needed to win      Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement   they voted for Senator Harry F  Byrd of Virginia  as did an elector from Oklahoma    Kennedy was the youngest man elected president  succeeding Eisenhower  who was then the oldest   Ronald Reagan surpassed Eisenhower as the oldest president in 1981      John F  Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20  1961  In his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens  famously saying   Ask not what your country can do for you  ask what you can do for your country   He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the  common enemies of man  tyranny  poverty  disease  and war itself      He added   All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days  Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days  nor in the life of this Administration  nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet  But let us begin   In closing  he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism   Finally  whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world  ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you      The address reflected Kennedy s confidence that his administration would chart an historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs  The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration     Kennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision making structure of former general Eisenhower  and he wasted no time in dismantling Eisenhower s methods    Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel  with all the spokes leading to the president  He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment  He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet   We can learn our jobs together   he stated     Much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes  Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge  This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda    The president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration  and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings  Deputy national security advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism  and Kennedy abruptly cut him off  asking   What do you want me to do about that today      Kennedy approved Defense secretary Robert McNamara  s controversial decision to award the contract for the F 111 TFX  Tactical Fighter Experimental  fighter bomber to General Dynamics  the choice of the civilian Defense department  over Boeing  the choice of the military     At the request of Senator Henry Jackson   Senator John McClellan held 46 days of mostly closed door hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigating the TFX contract from FebruaryNovember 1963     President Kennedy s foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union   manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the Cold War   In 1961  Kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev   The president started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961  The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union  but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge  His mistake helped raise tensions going into the Vienna Summit of June 1961     On the way to the summit  Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet Charles de Gaulle   who advised Kennedy to ignore Khrushchev s abrasive style  The French president feared the United States  presumed influence in Europe  Nevertheless  de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family  Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris  saying that he would be remembered as  the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris      On June 4  1961  the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the Premier to bully him  despite the warnings he had received  Khrushchev  for his part  was impressed with the president s intelligence  but thought him weak  Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them  a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin   He made it clear that any such treaty which interfered with U S access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war     Shortly after the president returned home  the U S S R  announced its intention to sign a treaty with East Berlin  abrogating any third party occupation rights in either sector of the city  Kennedy  depressed and angry  assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war  which he personally thought had a one in five chance of occurring     In the weeks immediately after the Vienna summit  more than 20 000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the USSR  Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue  where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies    In a July 1961 speech  Kennedy announced his decision to add  3 25billion to the defense budget  along with over 200 000 additional troops  stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U S  The speech received an 85  approval rating     The following month  the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city  which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall   Kennedy s initial reaction was to ignore this  as long as free access from West to East Berlin continued  This course was altered when it was learned that the West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States  Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson  along with a host of military personnel  in convoy through West Germany  including Soviet armed checkpoints  to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U S  to West Berlin     Kennedy gave a speech at Saint Anselm College on May 5  1960  regarding America s conduct in the emerging Cold War  The address detailed how American foreign policy should be conducted towards African nations  noting a hint of support for modern African nationalism by saying that  For we  too  founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule      The prior Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow the Fidel Castro regime in Cuba  The plan  led by the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  with help from the U S  military  was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter revolutionary insurgency composed of U S  trained anti Castro Cuban exiles     led by CIA paramilitary officers  The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people in hopes of removing Castro from power     On April 17  1961  Kennedy ordered what became known as the  Bay of Pigs Invasion   1 500 U S  trained Cubans  called  Brigade 2506   landed on the island  No U S  air support was provided  Allen Dulles   director of the CIA   later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action required for success once the troops were on the ground     By April 19  1961  the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles  and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1 189 survivors  After twenty months  Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for  53million worth of food and medicine    The incident made Castro wary of the U S  and led him to believe another invasion would occur     According to biographer Richard Reeves   Kennedy primarily focused on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations  When it failed  he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad    He took responsibility for the failure  saying   We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it  But maybe we ll learn something from it      In late 1961  the White House formed the  Special Group  Augmented    headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale  Secretary Robert McNamara   and others  The group s objectiveto overthrow Castro via espionage  sabotage  and other covert tacticswas never pursued     On October 14  1962  CIA U 2 spy planes took photographs of intermediate range ballistic missile sites being built in Cuba by the Soviets  The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16  a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat     Kennedy faced a dilemma  if the U S  attacked the sites  it might lead to nuclear war with the U S S R   but if the U S  did nothing  it would be faced with the increased threat from close range nuclear weapons  The U S  would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere  On a personal level  Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev  especially after the Vienna summit     More than a third of the members of the National Security Council  NSC  favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites  but for some of them this conjured up an image of  Pearl Harbor in reverse     There was also some reaction from the international community  asked in confidence   that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of U S  missiles that had been placed in Turkey by Eisenhower  There could also be no assurance that the assault would be 100  effective    In concurrence with a majority vote of the NSC  Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine  On October 22 he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced the decision on TV     The U S  Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba  beginning October 24  The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles  The president exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev  to no avail    United Nations  UN  Secretary General U Thant requested that both parties reverse their decisions and enter a cooling off period  Khrushchev said yes  but Kennedy said no     One Soviet flagged ship was stopped and boarded  On October 28 Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites  subject to UN inspections    The U S  publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its missiles in Turkey  which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM 27 Polaris missiles     This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since  In the end   the humanity  of the two men prevailed    The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president s credibility  Kennedy s approval rating increased from 66  to 77  immediately thereafter     Arguing that  those who make peaceful revolution impossible  will make violent revolution inevitable     Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in Latin America by establishing the Alliance for Progress   which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region    He worked closely with Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Muoz Marn for the development of the Alliance of Progress  and began working towards the autonomy of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico    When the president took office  the Eisenhower administration  through the CIA  had begun formulating plans for the assassination of Castro in Cuba and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic   Kennedy privately instructed the CIA that any such planning must include plausible deniability by the U S  His public position was in opposition    In June 1961 the Dominican Republic s leader was assassinated  in the days following the event  Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation  Robert Kennedy  who saw an opportunity for the U S   called Bowles  a gutless bastard  to his face     As one of his first presidential acts  Kennedy asked Congress to create the Peace Corps   His brother in law  Sargent Shriver   was the first director    Through this program  Americans volunteer to help underdeveloped nations in areas such as education  farming  health care  and construction  The organization grew to 5 000 members by March 1963 and 10 000 the following year    Since 1961  over 200 000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps  serving in 139 countries       When briefing Kennedy  Eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority  Eisenhower considered Laos to be  the cork in the bottle  in regards to the regional threat  In March 1961  Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a  free  Laos to a  neutral  Laos  indicating privately that Vietnam   and not Laos  should be deemed America s tripwire for communism s spread in the area     In May 1961 he dispatched Lyndon Johnson to meet with South Vietnam s President Ngo Dinh Diem   Johnson assured Diem more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists    Kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with Diem in defeat of communism in South Vietnam      Kennedy initially followed Eisenhower s lead  using limited military action to fight the communist forces led by Ho Chi Minh     He continued policies that provided political  economic  and military support to the South Vietnamese government    Late in 1961  the Viet Cong began assuming a predominant presence  initially seizing the provincial capital of Phuoc Vinh    Kennedy increased the number of helicopters  military advisors  and undeclared U S  Special Forces in the area  but he was reluctant to order a full scale deployment of troops       In late 1961  President Kennedy sent Roger Hilsman   then director of the State Department s Bureau of Intelligence and Research  to assess the situation in Vietnam  There  Hilsman met Sir Robert Thompson   head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam and the concept of the Strategic Hamlet Program was formed  It was approved by Kennedy and South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem   It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation  village internment  and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents  It was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government  By November 1963 the program waned and officially ended in 1964     In early 1962  Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the  National Security Action Memorandum Subversive Insurgency  War of Liberation      Secretary of State Dean Rusk voiced strong support for U S  involvement      Operation Ranch Hand    a large scale aerial defoliation effort  began on the roadsides of South Vietnam      b    In April 1963  Kennedy assessed the situation in Vietnam   We don t have a prayer of staying in Vietnam  Those people hate us  They are going to throw our asses out of there at any point  But I can t give up that territory to the communists and get the American people to re elect me     Kennedy faced a crisis in Vietnam by July  despite increased U S  support  the South Vietnamese military was only marginally effective against pro communist Viet Cong forces   On August 21  just as the new U S  Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge  Jr  arrived  Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu ordered South Vietnam forces  funded and trained by the CIA  to quell Buddhist demonstrations  The crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d tat to remove Diem with  or perhaps by  his brother  Nhu    Lodge was instructed to try to get Diem and Nhu to step down and leave the country  Diem would not listen to Lodge     Cable 243  DEPTEL 243   dated August 24  followed  declaring Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu s actions  and Lodge was ordered to pressure Diem to remove Nhu  If Diem refused  the Americans would explore alternative leadership    Lodge stated that the only workable option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and Nhu  as originally planned     At week s end  Kennedy learned from Lodge that the Diem government might  due to France s assistance to Nhu  be dealing secretly with the communistsand might ask the Americans to leave  orders were sent to Saigon and throughout Washington to  destroy all coup cables     At the same time  the first formal anti Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by U S  clergy from the Ministers  Vietnam Committee     A White House meeting in September was indicative of the very different ongoing appraisals  the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the Department of Defense  General Victor Krulak   and the State Department   Joseph Mendenhall    Krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won  while Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any U S  influence  Kennedy reacted  saying   Did you two gentlemen visit the same country   The president was unaware that the two men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight     In October 1963  the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General Maxwell D  Taylor to a Vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy  The objective of the McNamara Taylor mission  emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U S  representatives in Vietnam     In meetings with McNamara  Taylor  and Lodge  Diem again refused to agree to governing measures insisted upon by the U S   helping to dispel McNamara s previous optimism about Diem     Taylor and McNamara were also enlightened by Vietnam s vice president  Nguyen Ngoc Tho  choice of many to succeed Diem should a coup occur   who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor s information that the military was succeeding in the countryside    At Kennedy s insistence  the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals  1 000 by year s end and complete withdrawal in 1965  something the NSC considered a strategic fantasy    The final report declared that the military was making progress  that the increasingly unpopular Diem led government was not vulnerable to a coup  and that an assassination of Diem or Nhu was a possibility     In late October  intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot  The source  Vietnamese General Duong Van Minh  also known as  Big Minh    wanted to know the U S  position  Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup  excluding assassination  and to ensure deniability by the U S    Later that month  as the coup became imminent  Kennedy ordered all cables to be routed through him  A policy of  control and cut out  was initiated to insure presidential control of U S  responses  while cutting him out of the paper trail     On November 1  1963  South Vietnamese generals  led by  Big Minh   overthrew the Diem government   arresting and then killing Diem and Nhu   Kennedy was shocked by the deaths  He found out afterwards that Minh had asked the CIA field office to secure safe passage out of the country for Diem and Nhu  but was told that 24 hours were needed to procure a plane  Minh responded that he could not hold them that long     News of the coup initially led to renewed confidenceboth in America and in South Vietnamthat the war might be won    McGeorge Bundy drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas  It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam  with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia  Before leaving for Dallas  Kennedy told Michael Forrestal that  after the first of the year     he wanted  an in depth study of every possible option  including how to get out of there    to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top   When asked what he thought the president meant  Forrestal said   it was devil s advocate stuff      Historians disagree on whether Vietnam would have escalated had Kennedy survived and been re elected in 1964    Fueling the debate are statements made by Secretary of Defense McNamara in the film   The Fog of War   that Kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of Vietnam after the 1964 election    The film also contains a tape recording of Lyndon Johnson stating that Kennedy was planning to withdraw  a position that Johnson disagreed with    Kennedy had signed National Security Action Memorandum  NSAM  263  dated October 11  which ordered the withdrawal of 1 000 military personnel by the end of the year      Such an action would have been a policy reversal  but Kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his acclaimed speech about world peace at American University on June 10  1963     When Robert Kennedy was asked in 1964 what his brother would have done if the South Vietnamese had been on the brink of defeat  he replied   We d face that when we came to it     At the time of Kennedy s death  no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam    U S  involvement in the region escalated until Lyndon Johnson  his successor  directly deployed regular U S  military forces for fighting the Vietnam War       After Kennedy s assassination  President Johnson passed NSAM 273 on November 26  1963  It reversed Kennedy s decision to withdraw 1 000 troops  and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the South Vietnamese       On June 10  1963  Kennedy delivered at the high point of his rhetorical powers   the commencement address at American University in Washington  D C  Also known as  Strategy of Peace   Kennedy not only outlined a plan to curb nuclear arms  but also  laid out a hopeful  yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U S  and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race     The President wished  to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceivedyet it is the most important topic on earth  world peace    I speak of peace because of the new face of war   in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the Second World War    an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn    I speak of peace  therefore  as the necessary rational end of rational men    world peace  like community peace  does not require that each man love his neighborit requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance    our problems are man madetherefore they can be solved by man  And man can be as big as he wants     The president also made two announcementsthat the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and that the U S had postponed planned atmospheric tests     In 1963  Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east and the impending retirement of West German Chancellor Adenauer     At the same time  French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to built a Franco West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence        To Kennedy s eyes  this Franco German cooperation seemed directed against NATO  s influence in Europe     On June 26  President Kennedy gave a public speech in West Berlin reiterating the American commitment to Germany and criticizing communism  He was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience     Kennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism   Freedom has many difficulties  and democracy is not perfect  But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in  to prevent them from leaving us   The speech is known for its famous phrase   Ich bin ein Berliner     I am a citizen of Berlin    A million people were on the street for the speech    He remarked to Ted Sorensen afterwards   We ll never have another day like this one  as long as we live      In 1960  Kennedy stated   Israel will endure and flourish  It is the child of hope and the home of the brave  It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success  It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom      Subsequently as president  Kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with Israel  and he is credited as the founder of the US Israeli military alliance  which would be continued under subsequent presidents   Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel  Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment  he was the first to introduce the concept of a  special relationship   as he described it to Golda Meir   between the US and Israel     Kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to Israel in 1962 and  beginning in 1963  was the first US president to allow the sale to Israel of advanced US weaponry  the MIM 23 Hawk    as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies which were opposed by Arab neighbours  such as its water project on the Jordan River     As result of this newly created security alliance  Kennedy also encountered tensions with the Israeli government regarding the production of nuclear materials in Dimona   which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms race in the Middle East  After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the Israeli government  David Ben Gurion stated in a speech to the Israeli Knesset on December 21  1960  that the purpose of the nuclear plant at Beersheba was for  research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna     When Ben Gurion met with Kennedy in New York  he claimed that Dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes  for the time being      When Kennedy wrote that he was skeptical  and stated in a May 1963 letter to Ben Gurion that American support to Israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the Israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming  Ben Gurion repeated previous reassurances that Dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes  The Israeli government resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  inspections  In 1962  the US and Israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime  A science attach at the embassy in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of the Dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead American scientists when they visited     According to Seymour Hersh   the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the Americans  Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg stated   It was part of my job to tip them off that Kennedy was insisting on  an inspection      Hersh contends the inspections were conducted in such a way that it  guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash  as the president and his senior advisors had to understand  the American inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance  and with the full acquiescence of Israel      Marc Trachtenberg argued   Although well aware of what the Israelis were doing  Kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of Israeli compliance with America s non proliferation policy     The American who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find  ways to not reach the point of taking action against Israel s nuclear weapons program      Rodger Davies   the director of the State Department s Office of Near Eastern Affairs  concluded in March 1965 that Israel was developing nuclear weapons   He reported that Israel s target date for achieving nuclear capability was 196869    On May 1  1968  Undersecretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach told President Johnson that Dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year  The State Department argued that if Israel wanted arms  it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program    Dimona was never placed under IAEA safeguards  Attempts to write Israeli adherence to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  NPT  into contracts for the supply of U S  weapons continued throughout 1968     In 1963  the Kennedy administration backed the coup against the government of Iraq headed by Abd al Karim Qasim   who five years earlier had deposed the Western allied Iraqi monarchy     On February 8  1963  Kennedy received a memo stating   We will make informal friendly noises as soon as we can find out whom to talk with  and ought to recognize as soon as we re sure these guys are firmly in the saddle  CIA had excellent reports on the plotting  but I doubt either they or UK should claim much credit for it     The CIA had planned to remove Qasim in the past  but those efforts did not come to fruition     The new government  led by President Abdul Salam Arif and dominated by the Ba ath Party  along with a coalition of Nasserists and Iraqi nationalists    used listspossibly provided by the CIAof suspected communists and other leftists to systematically murder unknown numbers of Iraq s educated elite      After a power struggle with the Ba athist Prime Minister  Ahmed Hassan al Bakr   Arif purged the Ba ath Party from the government     Former CIA officer James Chritchfield disputed the notion that the CIA offered  active support  to the coup plotters  arguing that while  well informed  on the first coup  it was  surprised  by the power struggles that followed     During his four day visit to his ancestral home of Ireland in June 1963    Kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the Chief Herald of Ireland and received honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College  Dublin     He visited the cottage at Dunganstown  near New Ross   County Wexford where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to America     He also became the first foreign leader to address the Houses of the Oireachtas  the Irish parliament     On December 22  2006  the Irish Department of Justice released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as Kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit     Troubled by the long term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation   Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty  originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson  s 1956 presidential campaign    In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961  Khrushchev and Kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing  but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September  The United States responded by conducting tests five days later    Shortly thereafter  new U S  satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U S  in the arms race    Nevertheless  the greater nuclear strength of the U S  was of little value as long as the U S S R  perceived themselves to be at parity     In July 1963  Kennedy sent W  Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets    The introductory sessions included Khrushchev  who later delegated Soviet representation to Andrei Gromyko   It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented  due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance     Ultimately  the United States  the United Kingdom  and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty  which prohibited atomic testing on the ground  in the atmosphere  or underwater  but not underground  The U S  Senate ratified this and Kennedy signed it into law in October 1963  France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses     Kennedy called his domestic program the   New Frontier    It ambitiously promised federal funding for education  medical care for the elderly  economic aid to rural regions  and government intervention to halt the recession  Kennedy also promised an end to racial discrimination      In his 1963 State of the Union address   he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 2090  to a range of 1465   he proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47   Kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70  if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners    Congress did not act until 1964  after his death  when the top individual rate was lowered to 70   and the top corporate rate was set at 48   see Revenue Act of 1964       To the Economic Club of New York   he spoke in 1963 of     the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low  and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now     Congress passed few of Kennedy s major programs during his lifetime  but did vote them through in 196465 under his successor Johnson     Kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies  loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and encourage growth of the economy    He presided over the first government budget to top the  100billion mark  in 1962  and his first budget in 1961 led to the country s first non war  non recession deficit     The economy  which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office  accelerated notably during his presidency  Despite low inflation and interest rates  GDP had grown by an average of only 2 2  per annum during the Eisenhower presidency  scarcely more than population growth at the time   and had declined by 1  during Eisenhower s last twelve months in office     The economy turned around and prospered during the Kennedy administration  GDP expanded by an average of 5 5  from early 1961 to late 1963    while inflation remained steady at around 1  and unemployment eased    Industrial production rose by 15  and motor vehicle sales rose by 40     This rate of growth in GDP and industry continued until around 1969  and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time     Bobby Kennedy stated   We re going for broke      their expense accounts  where they ve been and what they ve been doing      the FBI is to interview them all      we can t lose this      Robert took the position that the steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices  The administration s actions influenced U S  Steel to rescind the price increase    The Wall Street Journal wrote that the administration had acted  by naked power  by threats  by agents of the state security police     Yale law professor Charles Reich opined in The New Republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict U S  Steel for collusion so quickly     A New York Times editorial praised Kennedy s actions and said that the steel industry s price increase  imperils the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation     Nevertheless  the administration s Bureau of Budget reported the price increase would have resulted in a net gain for GDP as well as a net budget surplus    The stock market  which had steadily declined since Kennedy s election  dropped 10  shortly after the administration s action on the steel industry     As president  Kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to Furman v  Georgia   a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions    Victor Feguer was sentenced to death by a federal court in Iowa and was executed on March 15  1963    Kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman Jimmie Henderson on February 12  1962  changing the penalty to life in prison     On March 22  1962  Kennedy signed into law HR5143  PL87 423   abolishing the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder in the District of Columbia  the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty    The death penalty has not been applied in the District of Columbia since 1957  and has now been abolished     The turbulent end of state sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s  Jim Crow segregation was the established law in the Deep South     The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled in 1954 in Brown v  Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional  Many schools  especially in southern states  did not obey the Supreme Court s decision  The Court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities  such as buses  restaurants  theaters  courtrooms  bathrooms  and beaches  but it continued nonetheless     Kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights  during the 1960 campaign he telephoned Coretta Scott King   wife of the Reverend Martin Luther King  Jr    who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter  Robert Kennedy called Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver and obtained King s release from prison  which drew additional black support to his brother s candidacy     In his first State of the Union Address in January 1961  President Kennedy said  The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race   at the ballot box and elsewhere   disturbs the national conscience  and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage     Kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress  which was dominated by conservative Southern Democrats  and he distanced himself from it     Kennedy also was more concerned with other issues early in his presidency  such as the Cold War   Bay of Pigs fiasco and the situation in Southeast Asia  As articulated by brother Robert  the administration s early priority was to  keep the president out of this civil rights mess   Many civil rights leaders viewed Kennedy as lukewarm  especially concerning the Freedom Riders   who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south  and who were repeatedly met with violence by whites  including law enforcement officers  both federal and state  Kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the Freedom Riders as an alternative to using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents  Robert Kennedy  speaking for the president  urged the Freedom Riders to  get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts      On March 6  1961  Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925 which required government contractors to  take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race  creed  color  or national origin     It established the President s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity   Displeased with the pace of Kennedy s addressing the issue of segregation  Martin Luther King  Jr  and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of Abraham Lincoln and use an Executive Order to deliver a blow for Civil Rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation   Kennedy did not execute the order     In September 1962  James Meredith enrolled at the University of Mississippi   but was prevented from entering  Attorney General Robert Kennedy responded by sending 400 federal marshals  while President Kennedy reluctantly sent 3 000 troops after the situation on campus turned violent    The Ole Miss riot of 1962 left two dead and dozens injured  but Meredith did finally enroll in his first class  The instigating subculture at the Old Miss riot and at many other racially ignited events  was the Ku Klux Klan     On November 20  1962  Kennedy signed Executive Order 11063   prohibiting racial discrimination in federally supported housing or  related facilities      In early 1963  Kennedy related to Martin Luther King  Jr   about the prospects for civil rights legislation   If we get into a long fight over this in Congress  it will bottleneck everything else  and we will still get no bill     Civil rights clashes were on the rise that year    Brother Robert and Ted Sorenson pressed Kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front     On June 11  1963  President Kennedy intervened when Alabama Governor George Wallace blocked the doorway to the University of Alabama to stop two African American students  Vivian Malone and James Hood   from attending  Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and the Alabama National Guard   which had just been federalized by order of the president  That evening Kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio  launching his initiative for civil rights legislationto provide equal access to public schools and other facilities  and greater protection of voting rights       His proposals became part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964   The day ended with the murder of a NAACP leader  Medgar Evers   in front of his home in Mississippi    As the president had predicted  the day after his TV speech  and in reaction to it  House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise him that his two year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia  Area Redevelopment Administration  had been defeated  primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans     Earlier  Kennedy had signed the executive order creating the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women on December 14  1961    Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission  The Commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination  their final report documenting legal and cultural barriers was issued in October 1963    Further  on June 10  1963  Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963   a federal law amending the Fair Labor Standards Act   aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex     Over a hundred thousand  predominantly African Americans  gathered in Washington for the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28  1963  Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress  and declined an invitation to speak  He turned over some of the details of the government s involvement to the Dept  of Justice  which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March  including the N A A C P  and Martin Luther King s Southern Christian Leadership Conference  SCLC      To ensure a peaceful demonstration  the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4 00pm  Thousands of troops were placed on standby  Kennedy watched King s speech on TV and was very impressed  The March was considered a  triumph of managed protest   and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred  Afterwards  the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken  Kennedy felt the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill     Nevertheless  the struggle was far from over  Three weeks later  a bomb exploded on Sunday  September 15 at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham  by the end of the day  four African American children had died in the explosion and two other children shot to death in the aftermath    Due to this resurgent violence  the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill  to the outrage of the president  Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill  without the additions  had enough votes to get it out of the House committee     In 1963  FBI Director J  Edgar Hoover   who hated civil rights leader Martin Luther King  Jr  and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker    presented the Kennedy Administration with allegations that some of King s close confidants and advisers were communists  Concerned that the allegations  if made public  would derail the Administration s civil rights initiatives  Robert Kennedy and the president both warned King to discontinue the suspect associations  After the associations continued  Robert Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference   King s civil rights organization     Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King s phones  on a trial basis  for a month or so     Hoover extended the clearance so his men were  unshackled  to look for evidence in any areas of King s life they deemed worthy    The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968     John F  Kennedy initially proposed an overhaul of American immigration policy that later was to become the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965   sponsored by Kennedy s brother Senator Edward Kennedy   It dramatically shifted the source of immigration from Northern and Western European countries towards immigration from Latin America and Asia  The policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification    Kennedy wanted to dismantle the selection of immigrants based on country of origin and saw this as an extension of his civil rights policies     Construction of the Kinzua Dam flooded 10 000 acres  4 047ha  of Seneca nation land that they had occupied under the Treaty of 1794   and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to Salamanca  New York   Kennedy was asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to intervene and halt the project  but he declined  citing a critical need for flood control  He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca  and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land  damages  and assistance to help mitigate their displacement       The Apollo program was conceived early in 1960  during the Eisenhower administration  as a follow up to Project Mercury   to be used as a shuttle to an Earth orbital space station   flights around the Moon  or landing on it  While NASA went ahead with planning for Apollo  funding for the program was far from certain  given Eisenhower s ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight    As Senator  Kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it     In constructing his Presidential administration  Kennedy elected to retain Eisenhower s last science advisor Jerome Wiesner as head of the President s Science Advisory Committee   Wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration    having issued a report highly critical of Project Mercury      Kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for NASA administrator before the post was accepted by James E  Webb   an experienced Washington insider who served President Harry S  Truman as budget director and undersecretary of State  Webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of Congress  the President  and the American people    Kennedy also persuaded Congress to amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the National Aeronautics and Space Council to the Vice President      both because of the knowledge of the space program Johnson gained in the Senate working for the creation of NASA   and to help keep the politically savvy Johnson occupied     In Kennedy s January 1961 State of the Union address  he had suggested international cooperation in space  Khrushchev declined  as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities    Early in his presidency  Kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program  but postponed any decision out of deference to Johnson  who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the Senate    Kennedy s advisors speculated that a Moon flight would be prohibitively expensive    and he was considering plans to dismantle the Apollo program due to its cost     However  this quickly changed on April 12  1961  when Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space  reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union    Kennedy now became eager for the U S  to take the lead in the Space Race   for reasons of strategy and prestige  On April 20  he sent a memo to Johnson  asking him to look into the status of America s space program  and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up      After consulting with Wernher von Braun   Johnson responded approximately one week later  concluding that  we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership       His memo concluded that a manned Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first    Kennedy s advisor Ted Sorensen advised him to support the Moon landing  and on May 25  Kennedy announced the goal in a speech titled Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs         I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal  before this decade is out  of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth  No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind  or more important for the long range exploration of space  and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish     Full text  After Congress authorized the funding  Webb began reorganizing NASA  increasing its staffing level  and building two new centers  a Launch Operations Center for the large Moon rocket northwest of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station   and a Manned Spacecraft Center on land donated through Rice University in Houston   Texas  Kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at Rice to promote the space effort on September 12  1962  in which he said    No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space     We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things  not because they are easy  but because they are hard     Full text  On November 21  1962  in a cabinet meeting with NASA administrator Webb and other officials  Kennedy explained that the Moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige  and that the expense was justified    Johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well  Costs for the Apollo program were expected to reach  40 billion     In a September 1963 speech before the United Nations  Kennedy urged cooperation between the Soviets and Americans in space  specifically recommending that Apollo be switched to  a joint expedition to the Moon     Khrushchev again declined  and the Soviets did not commit to a manned Moon mission until 1964    On July 20  1969  almost six years after Kennedy s death  Apollo 11 landed the first manned spacecraft on the Moon   President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas  Texas  at 12 30pm Central Standard Time on Friday November 22  1963  while on a political trip to Texas to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough  no relation  and conservative John Connally     Traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas  he was shot once in the throat    and once in the head     Kennedy was taken to Parkland Hospital for emergency medical treatment  but pronounced dead at 1 00pm  Only 46  President Kennedy died younger than any other U S  president to date  Lee Harvey Oswald   an employee of the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were suspected to have been fired  was arrested for the murder of a local police officer  and was subsequently charged with the assassination of Kennedy  He denied shooting anyone  claiming he was a patsy       but was killed by Jack Ruby on November 24  before he could be tried  Ruby was then arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald  Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3  1967  while the date for his new trial was being set   President Johnson created the Warren Commission chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren to investigate the assassination  which concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin  The results of this investigation are disputed by many    The assassination proved to be an important moment in U S  history because of its impact on the nation and the ensuing political repercussions  A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66  of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy   while 74  thought there had been a cover up    A Gallup Poll in mid November 2013  showed 61  believed in a conspiracy  and only 30  thought Oswald did it alone    In 1979  the U S  House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that it believed  that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy   The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy      A Requiem Mass was held for Kennedy at the Cathedral of St  Matthew the Apostle on November 25  1963  Afterwards  Kennedy s body was buried in a small plot   20by 30ft    in Arlington National Cemetery   Over a period of three years  196466   an estimated 16million people had visited his grave  On March 14  1967  Kennedy s body was moved to a permanent burial plot and memorial at the cemetery  The funeral was officiated by Father John J  Cavanaugh     It was from this memorial that the graves of both Bobby and Ted were modeled   The honor guard at Kennedy s graveside was the 37th Cadet Class of the Irish Army   Kennedy was greatly impressed by the Irish Cadets on his last official visit to Ireland  so much so that Jackie Kennedy requested the Irish Army to be the honor guard at her husband s funeral     Kennedy s wife  Jacqueline and their two deceased minor children were buried with him later  His brother  Senator Robert Kennedy  was buried nearby in June 1968  In August 2009  his brother  Senator Edward M  Kennedy   was also buried near his two brothers  John F  Kennedy s grave is lit with an   Eternal Flame    Kennedy and William Howard Taft are the only two U S  presidents buried at Arlington      According to the JFK Library    I Have a Rendezvous with Death   by Alan Seeger  was one of John F  Kennedy s favorite poems and he often asked his wife to recite it      Kennedy appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States    In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments  Kennedy appointed 21 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals   and 102 judges to the United States district courts    Kennedy met his future wife  Jacqueline Lee  Jackie  Bouvier  19291994   when he was a congressman  Charles L  Bartlett   a journalist  introduced the pair at a dinner party    They were married a year after he was elected senator  on September 12  1953    The Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States  having produced a president  three senators  and multiple other Representatives  both on the federal and state level  Family patriarch  Joe Kennedy  was a prominent American businessman and political figure  serving in multiple roles  including Ambassador to the United Kingdom   from 1938 to 1940   In October 1951  during his third term as Massachusetts s 11th district congressman  the then 34 year old Kennedy embarked on a seven week trip to India  Japan  Vietnam   and Israel with his then 25 year old brother Bobby  who had just graduated from law school four months earlier  and his then 27 year old sister Pat  Because they were several years apart in age  the brothers had previously seen little of each other  This 25 000 mile  40 000km  trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends     Bobby was campaign manager for Kennedy s successful 1952 Senate campaign and later  his successful 1960 presidential campaign  The two brothers worked closely together from 1957 to 1959 on the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field   when Robert was its chief counsel  During Kennedy s presidency  Robert served in his cabinet as Attorney General and was his closest advisor     Kennedy was a life member of the National Rifle Association       Kennedy came in third  behind Martin Luther King  Jr  and Mother Teresa   in Gallup s List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century       Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born in 1957 and is the only surviving member of JFK s immediate family  John Fitzgerald Kennedy  Jr    nicknamed  John John  by the press as a child  was born in late November 1960  17 days after his father was elected  John Jr   died in 1999 when the small plane he was piloting crashed en route to Martha s Vineyard      Kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them  and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians  influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines  Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television  Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium    In 1961 the Radio Television News Directors Association presented Kennedy with its highest honor  the Paul White Award  in recognition of his open relationship with the media     Mrs  Kennedy brought new art and furniture to the White House  and directed its restoration  They invited a range of artists  writers and intellectuals to rounds of White House dinners  raising the profile of the arts in America  On the White House lawn  the Kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house  while Caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home   The president was closely tied to popular culture  emphasized by songs such as   Twisting at the White House   Vaughn Meader s First Family comedy album  which parodied the president  the first lady  their family  and the administration  sold about four million copies  On May 19  1962  Marilyn Monroe sang   Happy Birthday  Mr  President   at a large party in Madison Square Garden   celebrating Kennedy s upcoming forty fifth birthday   The term   Camelot   came to be retroactively seen as iconic of the Kennedy administration  and the charisma of him and his family  The term was first publicly used by his wife  in a post assassination Life magazine interview with Theodore H  White   in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary Broadway musical of the same name   particularly the closing lines of the title song     Don t let it be forgot  that once there was a spot  for one brief  shining moment that was known as Camelot   There ll be great presidents again     but there will never be another Camelot    In 2002 Robert Dallek wrote an extensive history of Kennedy s health  Dallek was able to consult a collection of Kennedy associated papers from the years 1955 1963 including x rays and prescription records from the files of White House physician Dr  Janet Travell   According to Travell s records  during his Presidential years Kennedy suffered from  high fevers  stomach  colon  and prostate issues  abscesses  high cholesterol  and adrenal problems  Travell kept a  Medicine Administration Record   cataloguing Kennedy s medications   injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency  procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back  Lomotil  Metamucil  paregoric  phenobarbital  testosterone  and trasentine to control his diarrhea  abdominal discomfort  and weight loss  penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary tract infections and an abscess  and Tuinal to help him sleep      Years after Kennedy s death  it was revealed that in September 1947  while Kennedy was 30 and in his first term in Congress  he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at The London Clinic with Addison s disease   a rare endocrine disorder  In 1966 Dr  Travell revealed that Kennedy also had hypothyroidism   The presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2  APS 2      Kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain  for which he had surgery and was written up in the American Medical Association  s Archives of Surgery   Kennedy s condition may have had diplomatic repercussions  as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 Vienna Summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev   The combination included hormones  animal organ cells  steroids  vitamins  enzymes  and amphetamines  and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity  hypertension   impaired judgment  nervousness  and mood swings    Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors  one of whom  Max Jacobson   was unknown to the other two  as his mode of treatment was controversial   and used for the most severe bouts of back pain     There were disagreements among his doctors  into late 1961  over the proper balance of medication and exercise  with the president preferring the former as he was short on time and desired immediate relief    During that timeframe the president s physician  George Burkley  did set up some gym equipment in the White House basement where Kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week    Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy s lifetime     Kennedy experienced many personal  family tragedies  The oldest Kennedy sibling  Joe Jr    was killed in action over the English Channel in 1944 during World War II at the age of 29  Kennedy s younger sister Rose Marie  Rosemary  Kennedy was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a pre frontal lobotomy at age 23  leaving her permanently incapacitated  His next youngest sister  Kathleen  Kick  Kennedy Cavendish  died in France as the result of a plane crash in 1948  Jacqueline Kennedy wife suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956  A son  Patrick Bouvier Kennedy   died shortly after birth in August 1963   As a young single man in the 1940s  Kennedy had affairs with Danish journalist Inga Arvad     and actress Gene Tierney     Later in life  Kennedy reportedly had affairs with a number of women  including Marilyn Monroe     Gunilla von Post     Judith Campbell     Mary Pinchot Meyer     Marlene Dietrich     Mimi Alford     and his wife s press secretary Pamela Turnure     The extent of a relationship with Monroe will never be known  although it has been reported they spent a weekend together in March 1962 while Kennedy was staying at Bing Crosby  s house    Furthermore  the White House switchboard noted calls from her during 1962    J  Edgar Hoover   the FBI director  received reports as to Kennedy s indiscretions     Kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters    According to Reeves  this included  the logistics of Kennedy s liaisons      which  required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians     Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from revelations about his sex life     The Kennedy family originally came from Dunganstown  County Wexford   Ireland     In 1848  Patrick Kennedy  18231858  left his farm and boarded a ship in New Ross bound for Liverpool on his way to Boston     Kennedy departed at the height of Ireland s Great Famine   It was in Boston he met the woman he was to marry  Bridget Murphy  c 18241888      Kennedy s paternal great grandfather came to Boston and took a job as a migrant worker  He died several years later from cholera     They had three daughters and two sons  the elder son died young from cholera   He left behind a widow and four children to carry on  the youngest child being Joseph Kennedy  Sr  s father  Patrick Joseph  P  J   Kennedy    Television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding John F  Kennedy s assassination  In fact  television started to come of age before the assassination  On September 2  1963  Kennedy helped inaugurate network television s first half hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Walter Cronkite      Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information  In this sense it was the first major  TV news event  of its kind  the TV coverage uniting the nation  interpreting what went on and creating memories of this space in time  All three major U S  television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all news coverage from November 22 through November 25  1963  being on the air for 70 hours  making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9 11     Kennedy s state funeral procession and the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald were all broadcast live in America and in other places around the world  The state funeral was the first of three in a span of 12 months  The other two were for General Douglas MacArthur and President Herbert Clark Hoover   All three have two things in common  the commanding general of the Military District of Washington during those funerals was Army Major General Philip C  Wehle and the riderless horse was Black Jack   who also served in that role during Lyndon B  Johnson  s funeral   The assassination had an effect on many people  not only in the U S  but around the world  Many vividly remember where they were when first learning of the news that Kennedy was assassinated  as with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7  1941  before it and the September 11 attacks after it  UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson said of the assassination   all of us      will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours   Many people have also spoken of the shocking news  compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin s   the possible instigators and the causes of the killing as an end to innocence  and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s  especially the Vietnam War    The US Special Forces had a special bond with Kennedy   It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret   said Forrest Lindley  a writer for the US military newspaper Stars and Stripes who served with Special Forces in Vietnam    c   This bond was shown at Kennedy s funeral   At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy s death  General Michael D  Healy   the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam  spoke at Arlington Cemetery   Later  a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave  continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin   Kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the U S  Navy    and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command  the Navy SEALs     which Kennedy enthusiastically supported     Ultimately  the death of President Kennedy and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishmenta point made by commentators from Gore Vidal to Arthur M  Schlesinger  Jr  and implied by Oliver Stone in several of his films  such as his landmark 1991 JFK    Although President Kennedy opposed segregation and had shown support for the civil rights of African Americans  he originally believed in a more measured approach to legislation given the political realities he faced in Congress  especially with the Southern Conservatives    However  impelled by the civil rights demonstrations of Martin Luther King   Kennedy in 1963 proposed legislative action  In a radio and TV address to the nation in June 1963a century after President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation Kennedy became the first president to call on all Americans to denounce racism as morally wrong  Kennedy s civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964      President Lyndon B  Johnson   Kennedy s successor  took up the mantle and pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president s memory      President Johnson then signed the Act into law on July 2  1964  This civil rights law ended what was known as the   Solid South   and certain provisions were modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1875   signed into law by President Ulysses S  Grant      Kennedy s continuation of Presidents Harry S  Truman and Dwight D  Eisenhower  s policies of giving economic and military aid to South Vietnam left the door open for President Johnson s escalation of the conflict    At the time of Kennedy s death  no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam  leading historians  cabinet members and writers to continue to disagree on whether the Vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived      His agreement to the NSAM 263   action of withdrawing 1 000 troops by the end of 1963  and his earlier 1963 speech at American University     suggested he was ready to end the Vietnam War   The Vietnam War contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties  amid violent disappointment on the political landscape   Many of Kennedy s speeches  especially his inaugural address  are considered iconic  and despite his relatively short term in office and lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term  Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents  in the same league as Abraham Lincoln   George Washington   and Franklin D  Roosevelt   Some excerpts of Kennedy s inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington   He was posthumously awarded the Pacem in Terris Award   It was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations  Pacem in terris is Latin for  Peace on Earth    President Kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father  He is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent  His maternal grandmother  Mary Josephine  Josie  Hannon  died in August 1964  several months after his assassination   Throughout the English speaking world   the given name Kennedy has sometimes been used in honor of President Kennedy  as well his brother Robert     In 1961  Kennedy was presented with a grant of arms for all the descendants of Patrick Kennedy from the Chief Herald of Ireland   The design of the arms strongly alludes to symbols in the coats of arms of the O Kennedys of Ormonde and the FitzGeralds of Desmond  from whom the family is believed to be descended  The crest is an armored hand holding four arrows between two olive branches  elements taken from the coat of arms of the United States of America and also symbolic of Kennedy and his brothers   Kennedy received a signet ring engraved with his arms for his 44th birthday as a gift from his wife  and the arms were incorporated into the seal of the USS John F  Kennedy   Following his assassination  Kennedy was honored by the Canadian government by having a mountain  Mount Kennedy   named for him  which his brother  Robert Kennedy  climbed in 1965 to plant a banner of the arms at the summit     General  ",

March 16   O S  March 5  1751 June 28  1836  was an American statesman  political theorist  and the fourth President of the United States  180917   He is hailed as the  Father of the Constitution  for being instrumental in the drafting of the U S  Constitution and as the key champion and author of the Bill of Rights     He served as a politician much of his adult life   After the constitution had been drafted  Madison became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify it  His collaboration with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay produced The Federalist Papers  1788   Circulated only in New York at the time  they would later be considered among the most important treatises in support of the Constitution  He was also a delegate to the Virginia constitutional ratifying convention  and was instrumental to the successful ratification effort in Virginia  Like most of his contemporaries  Madison changed his political views during his life  During the drafting and ratification of the constitution  he favored a strong national government  though later he grew to favor stronger state governments  before settling between the two extremes late in his life   In 1789  Madison became a leader in the new House of Representatives   drafting many basic laws  He is notable for drafting the first ten amendments to the Constitution  and thus is known as the  Father of the Bill of Rights     Madison worked closely with President George Washington to organize the new federal government  Breaking with Hamilton and what became the Federalist Party in 1791  Madison and Thomas Jefferson organized what they called the Republican Party  later called by historians the Democratic Republican Party     As Jefferson s Secretary of State  180109   Madison supervised the Louisiana Purchase   which doubled the nation s size  After his election to the presidency  he presided over renewed prosperity for several years  As president  180917   after the failure of diplomatic protests and a trade embargo against the United Kingdom   he led the U S  into the War of 1812   He was responding to British encroachments on American honor and rights  in addition  he wanted to end the influence of the British among their Indian allies  whose resistance blocked U S  settlement in the Midwest around the Great Lakes   Madison found the war to be an administrative nightmare  as the United States had neither a strong army nor financial system  as a result  he afterward supported a stronger national government and a strong military  as well as the national bank  which he had long opposed  Like other Virginian statesmen in the state s slave society    he was a slaveholder who inherited his plantation known as Montpelier   and owned hundreds of slaves during his lifetime to cultivate tobacco and other crops  Madison supported the Three Fifths Compromise that allowed three fifths of the enumerated population of slaves to be counted for representation       James Madison  Jr  was born at Belle Grove Plantation near Port Conway  Virginia on March 16  1751   March 5  1751  Old Style   Julian calendar    where his mother had returned to her parents  home to give birth  He grew up as the oldest of twelve children    Nelly and James Sr  had seven more boys and four girls  Three of James Jr  s brothers died as infants  including one who was stillborn   In the summer of 1775  his sister Elizabeth  age 7  and his brother Reuben  age 3  died in a dysentery epidemic that swept through Orange County because of contaminated water       His father  James Madison  Sr   17231801   was a tobacco planter who grew up on a plantation  then called Mount Pleasant   in Orange County  Virginia   which he had inherited upon reaching adulthood  He later acquired more property and slaves  with 5 000 acres  2 000ha   he became the largest landowner and a leading citizen of Orange County  in the Piedmont  James Jr  s mother  Nelly Conway Madison  17311829   was born at Port Conway  the daughter of a prominent planter and tobacco merchant and his wife  Madison s parents were married on September 15  1749      In these years the southern colonies were becoming a slave society  in which slave labor powered the economy and slaveholders formed the political lite     From ages 11 to 16  the young  Jemmy  Madison was sent to study under Donald Robertson  an instructor at the Innes plantation in King and Queen County  Virginia in the Tidewater region  Robertson was a Scottish teacher who tutored numerous prominent plantation families in the South  From Robertson  Madison learned mathematics  geography  and modern and ancient languages  He became especially proficient in Latin  Madison said that he owed his bent for learning  largely to that man  Robertson         At age 16  he returned to Montpelier  where he began a two year course of study under the Reverend Thomas Martin in preparation for college  Unlike most college bound Virginians of his day  Madison did not choose the College of William and Mary   because the lowland climate of Williamsburg   where mosquitoes transmitted fevers and other infectious diseases during the summer  might have strained his delicate health  Instead  in 1769  he enrolled at the College of New Jersey  now Princeton University   where he became roommates and close friends with poet Philip Freneau   Madison unsuccessfully proposed to Freneau s sister Mary     Through diligence and long hours of study that may have damaged his health    Madison graduated in 1771  His studies included Latin   Greek   science   geography   mathematics   rhetoric   and philosophy   Great emphasis also was placed on speech and debate  Madison helped found the American Whig Society   in direct competition to fellow student Aaron Burr  s Cliosophic Society  After graduation  Madison remained at Princeton to study Hebrew and political philosophy under the university president  John Witherspoon   before returning to Montpelier in the spring of 1772  He became quite fluent in Hebrew   Madison studied law from his interest in public policy  not with the intent of practicing law as a profession     At a height of only five feet  four inches  163cm   and never weighing more than 100 pounds  he was the smallest president     Although educated by Presbyterian clergymen  young Madison was an avid reader of English deist tracts    Madison as an adult paid little attention to religious matters  Hutson says that historians searching through Madison s voluminous writings discover that after he left college   there is no trace  no clue as to his personal religious convictions     However  some scholars say he leaned toward deism       Others maintain that Madison accepted Christian tenets generally and formed his outlook on life within a Christian world view     After graduation from Princeton  young Madison took an increasing interest in the relationship between the American colonies and Great Britain  which deteriorated over the issue of British taxation  In 1774  Madison took a seat on the local Committee of Safety  a patriot pro revolution group that oversaw the local militia  This was the first step in a life of public service that his family s wealth allowed him to pursue    In October 1775 he was commissioned as the colonel of the Orange County militia  He would not serve in combat on account of poor health     As a young man during the American Revolutionary War   Madison served in the Virginia state legislature  17761779   where he became known as a protg of the delegate Thomas Jefferson  He had earlier witnessed the persecution of Baptist preachers in Virginia  who were arrested for preaching without a license from the established Anglican Church   He worked with the Baptist preacher Elijah Craig on constitutional guarantees for religious liberty in Virginia    Working on such cases helped form his ideas about religious freedom  which he applied to the Constitution and Bill of Rights   Madison attained prominence in Virginia politics  working with Jefferson to draft the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom   which was finally passed in 1786  It disestablished the Church of England and disclaimed any power of state compulsion in religious matters  He excluded Patrick Henry  s plan to compel citizens to pay taxes that would go to a congregation of their choice  In 1777 Madison s cousin  the Right Reverend James Madison  17491812   became president of The College of William   Mary   Working closely with Madison and Jefferson  Bishop Madison helped lead the College through the changes involving separation from both Great Britain and the Church of England  He also led college and state actions that resulted in the formation of the new Episcopal Diocese of Virginia after the Revolution   As the youngest delegate to the Continental Congress  17801783   Madison was considered a legislative workhorse and a master of parliamentary coalition building      He persuaded Virginia to give up its claims to northwestern territoriesconsisting of most of modern day Ohio and points westto the Continental Congress   It created the Northwest Territory in 1783  as a federally supervised territory from which new states would be developed and admitted to the union  Virginia s land claims had partially overlapped with those of Connecticut  Pennsylvania and Maryland  they too ceded their westernmost lands to national authority  with the understanding that new states could be formed from the land  The Northwest Ordinance prohibited slavery in the new territory north of the Ohio River  but did not end it for those slaves held by settlers already in the territory   Madison was elected a second time to the Virginia House of Delegates   serving from 1784 to 1786 in the new years of independence  During these final years in the House of Delegates  Madison grew increasingly frustrated with what he saw as excessive democracy  He criticized the tendency for delegates to cater to the particular interests of their constituents  even if such interests were destructive to the state at large  In particular  he was troubled by a law that denied diplomatic immunity to ambassadors from other countries  and a law that legalized paper money    He thought legislators should be  disinterested  and act in the interests of their state at large  even if this contradicted the wishes of constituents  This  excessive democracy   Madison grew to believe  was the cause of a larger social decay which he and others  such as Washington  believed had resumed after the revolution and was nearing a tipping point  They were alarmed by Shays  Rebellion      The Articles of Confederation established the United States as a confederation of sovereign states with a weak central government  This arrangement did not work particularly well  and was even less successful after the war was over  Congress had no power to tax  and as a result was unable to pay debts left over from the Revolution  Madison and other nationalists  such as Washington and Alexander Hamilton   were very concerned about this  They feared a break up of the union and national bankruptcy    The historian Gordon S  Wood has noted that many leaders  including Madison and Washington  feared more that the revolution had not fixed the social problems that had triggered it and that the excesses ascribed to the King were being seen in the state legislatures  Shays  Rebellion is often cited as the event that forced the issue  Wood argues that many at the time saw it as only the most extreme example of democratic excess  They believed the constitution would need to do more than fix the Articles of Confederation  Like the revolution  it would need to rewrite the social compact and redefine the relationship among the states  the national government  and the people     As Madison wrote   a crisis had arrived which was to decide whether the American experiment was to be a blessing to the world  or to blast for ever the hopes which the republican cause had inspired     Partly at Madison s instigation  a national convention was called in 1787  Madison was crucial in persuading George Washington to attend the convention  since he knew how important the popular general would be to the adoption of a constitution  As one of the first delegates to arrive  while waiting for the convention to begin  Madison wrote what became known as the Virginia Plan   The Virginia Plan was submitted at the opening of the convention  and the work of the convention quickly became to amend the Virginia Plan and to fill in the gaps      Though the Virginia Plan was an outline rather than a draft of a possible constitution  and though it was extensively changed during the debate  especially by John Rutledge and James Wilson in the Committee of Detail    its use at the convention led many to call Madison the  Father of the Constitution     He was only 36 years old   During the course of the Convention  Madison spoke over two hundred times  and his fellow delegates rated him highly  For example  William Pierce wrote that      every Person seems to acknowledge his greatness  In the management of every great question he evidently took the lead in the Convention     he always comes forward as the best informed Man of any point in debate   Madison recorded the unofficial minutes of the convention  and these have become the only comprehensive record of what occurred  The historian Clinton Rossiter regarded Madison s performance as  a combination of learning  experience  purpose  and imagination that not even Adams or Jefferson could have equaled     Years earlier he had pored over crates of books that Jefferson sent him from France on various forms of government  The historian Douglas Adair called Madison s work  probably the most fruitful piece of scholarly research ever carried out by an American     Many have argued that this study helped prepare him for the convention   Gordon Wood   however  argues that Madison s frustrating experience in the Virginia legislature years earlier most shaped his constitutional views  Wood notes that the governmental structure in both the Virginia Plan and the final constitution were not innovative  since they were copied from the British government  had been used in the states since 1776  and numerous authors had already argued for their adoption at the national level    Most of what was controversial in the Virginia Plan was removed  and most of the rest had been commonly accepted as necessary for a functional government  state or national  for decades  thus  Madison s contribution was more qualitative    Wood argues that  like most national politicians of the late 1780s  Madison believed that the problem was less with the Articles of Confederation than with the nature of the state legislatures  He believed the solution was to restrain the excesses of the states  This required more than an alteration in the Articles of Confederation  it required a change in the character of the national compact  The ultimate question before the convention  Wood notes  was not how to design a government but whether the states should remain sovereign  whether sovereignty should be transferred to the national government  or whether the constitution should settle somewhere in between     Those  like Madison  who thought democracy in the state legislatures was excessive and insufficiently  disinterested   wanted sovereignty transferred to the national government  while those  like Patrick Henry   who did not think this a problem  wanted to fix the Articles of Confederation  Madison was one of the only delegates who wanted to deprive the states of sovereignty completely  which he considered the only solution to the problem  Though sharing the same goal as Madison  most other delegates reacted strongly against such an extreme change to the status quo  Though Madison lost most of his battles over how to amend the Virginia Plan  most importantly over the exclusion of the Council of Revision    in the process he increasingly shifted the debate away from a position of pure state sovereignty  Since most disagreements over what to include in the constitution were ultimately disputes over the balance of sovereignty between the states and national government  Madison s influence was critical  Wood notes that Madison s ultimate contribution was not in designing any particular constitutional framework  but in shifting the debate toward a compromise of  shared sovereignty  between the national and state governments       The Constitution developed by the convention in Philadelphia had to be ratified  This would be done by special conventions called in each state to decide that sole question of ratification    Madison was a leader in the ratification effort  He  Alexander Hamilton and John Jay wrote The Federalist Papers  a series of 85 newspaper articles published in New York to explain how the proposed Constitution would work  mainly by responding to criticisms from anti federalists  They were also published in book form and became a virtual debater s handbook for the supporters of the Constitution in the ratifying conventions    The historian Clinton Rossiter called The Federalist Papers  the most important work in political science that ever has been written  or is likely ever to be written  in the United States     They were not scholarly arguments or impartial justifications for the constitution  but political polemics intended to assist the federalists in New York  which was the only state to have a coordinated anti federalist movement  One reason Madison was involved in the project was because he was a delegate to the lame duck Confederation Congress  which was meeting in New York   If Virginia  the most populous state at the time  did not ratify the Constitution  the new national government would likely not succeed  When the Virginia convention began  the constitution had not yet been ratified by the required nine states  New York  the second largest state and a bastion of anti federalism  would likely not ratify it if Virginia rejected the constitution  and Virginia s exclusion from the new government would disqualify George Washington from being the first president    Virginia delegates believed that Washington s election as the first president was an implicit condition for their acceptance of the new constitution and the new government  Without Virginia  a new convention might have been held and a new constitution written in a much more polarized atmosphere  since the constitution did not specify what would happen if it was only partially ratified  The states might have joined in regional confederacies or allied with Spain  France or Britain  which still had North American colonies    Arguably the most prominent anti federalist  the powerful orator Patrick Henry was a delegate and had a following second only to Washington  who was not a delegate   Most delegates believed that most Virginians opposed the constitution    Initially Madison did not want to stand for election to the Virginia ratifying convention  but was persuaded to do so because the situation looked so bad  His role at the convention was likely critical to Virginia s ratification  and thus to the success of the constitution generally     As the states were leery of creating a powerful central government  the drive to achieve ratification was difficult  Patrick Henry feared that the constitution would trample on the independence of the states and the rights of citizens  In the Virginia ratifying convention  Madison  who was a poor public speaker  had to go up against Henry  who was the most esteemed orator in the country    Although Henry was by far the more powerful and dramatic speaker  Madison successfully matched him  While Henry s arguments were emotional appeals to possible unintended consequences  Madison responded with rational answers to these claims  he eventually argued that Henry s claims were becoming absurd  Madison pointed out that a limited government would be created  and that the powers delegated  to the federal government are few and defined     Madison persuaded prominent figures such as George Mason and Edmund Randolph   who had refused to endorse the constitution at the convention  to change their position and support it at the ratifying convention  Mason and Randolph s switch likely changed the votes of several more anti federalists    When the vote was nearing  and the constitution still looked likely to be defeated  Madison pleaded with a small group of anti federalists  and promised them he would push for a bill of rights later if they changed their votes  When the vote was held  the convention barely had sufficient votes to ratify  and these likely did not appear until the last minute     In terms of slavery and the Constitution  Madison viewed African American slaves as an  unfortunate race  and believed their true nature was both human and property    On February 12  1788  Madison  in the Federalist Letter No  54   stated that the Constitutional three fifths compromise clause was the best alternative for the slaves  current condition and for determining representation of citizens in Congress    Madison believed that slaves  as property  would be protected by both their masters and the government     Madison was called the  Father of the Constitution  by his peers in his own lifetime  However  he was modest  and he protested the title as being  a credit to which I have no claim      The Constitution was not  like the fabled Goddess of Wisdom  the offspring of a single brain  It ought to be regarded as the work of many heads and many hands     He wrote Hamilton at the New York ratifying convention  stating his opinion that  ratification was in toto and  for ever     Madison had been a delegate to the Confederation Congress  and wanted to be elected senator in the new government  A vengeful Patrick Henry wanted to deny Madison a seat in the new congress  so he ensured that Madison remained in the lame duck Confederation Congress to prevent him as long as possible from campaigning  Henry used his power to keep the Virginia legislature from appointing Madison as one of the state s senators  When Madison decided to run for election to the house instead  Henry gerrymandered Madison s home district  filling it with anti federalists in an attempt to prevent Madison s election  Madison could have run in another district  so to prevent this  Henry forced through a law requiring congressmen to live in the district they represent  Later this was recognized as unconstitutional but  at the time  the law made it increasingly unlikely that Madison would be elected to congress  He ran against James Monroe   a future president  and traveled with Monroe while campaigning  Later as president  Madison was told by some of his former constituents that  had it not been for unusually bad weather on election day  Monroe likely would have won  Madison defeated Monroe and became an important leader in Congress     Though the idea for a bill of rights had been suggested at the end of the constitutional convention  the delegates wanted to go home and thought the suggestion unnecessary  The omission of a bill of rights became the main argument of the anti federalists against the constitution  Though no state conditioned ratification of the constitution on a bill of rights  several states came close  and the issue almost prevented the constitution from being ratified  Some anti federalists continued to contest this after the constitution had been ratified and threatened the entire nation with another constitutional convention  This would likely have been far more partisan than the first  Madison objected to a specific bill of rights   for several reasons  he thought it was unnecessary  since it purported to protect against powers that the federal government had not been granted  that it was dangerous  since enumeration of some rights might be taken to imply the absence of other rights  and that at the state level  bills of rights had proven to be useless paper barriers against government powers     Though few in the new congress wanted to debate a possible Bill of Rights  for the next century  most thought that the Declaration of Independence   not the first ten constitutional amendments  constituted the true Bill of Rights   Madison pressed the issue    Congress was extremely busy with setting up the new government  most wanted to wait for the system to show its defects before amending the constitution  and the anti federalist movements  which had demanded a new convention  had died out quickly once the constitution was ratified  Despite this  Madison still feared that the states would compel congress to call for a new constitutional convention  which they had the right to do  He also believed that the constitution did not sufficiently protect the national government from excessive democracy and parochialism  the defects he saw in the state governments   so he saw his amendments as a way to mitigate these problems  On June 8  1789  Madison introduced his bill proposing amendments consisting of Nine Articles comprising up to 20 Amendments  depending on how one counts  Madison initially proposed that the amendments be incorporated into the body of the Constitution  The House passed most of his slate of amendments  but rejected the idea of placing the amendments in the body of the Constitution  Instead  it adopted 17 amendments to be attached separately and sent this bill to the Senate       The Senate condensed this slate to eleven amendments and removed the language that Madison had included to integrate them into the body of the constitution    The Senate also added what became the Ninth Amendment  which was not in his original slate    To Madison s deep disappointment  it excluded a proposed amendment guaranteeing national sovereignty over the states  Some have argued that if this amendment had been included  the American Civil War could have been avoided    By 1791  the last ten of the proposed amendments were ratified and became the Bill of Rights   The Second Amendment originally proposed by Madison  but not then ratified  was later ratified in 1992 as the Twenty seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution   The remaining proposal was intended to accommodate future increase in the members of the House of Representatives   When Britain and France went to war in 1793  the U S  was caught in the middle  The 1778 treaty of alliance with France was still in effect  yet most of the new country s trade was with Britain  War with Britain seemed imminent in 1794  as the British seized hundreds of American ships that were trading with French colonies  Madison believed that Britain was weak and the United States was strong  and that a trade war with Britain  although risking a real war by the British government  probably would succeed  and would allow Americans to assert their independence fully  Great Britain  he charged   has bound us in commercial manacles  and very nearly defeated the object of our independence   As Varg explains  Madison discounted the much more powerful British army and navy for  her interests can be wounded almost mortally  while ours are invulnerable   The British West Indies  Madison maintained  could not live without American foodstuffs  but Americans could easily do without British manufactures  This faith led him to the conclusion  that it is in our power  in a very short time  to supply all the tonnage necessary for our own commerce     However  George Washington avoided a trade war and instead secured friendly trade relations with Britain through the Jay Treaty of 1794  Madison threw his energies into fighting the Treatyhis mobilization of grassroots support helped form the First Party System   He failed in both the Senate and House  and the Jay Treaty led to ten years of prosperous trade with Britain  and anger on the part of France leading to the Quasi War   All across the United States  voters divided for and against the Treaty and other key issues  and thus became either Federalists or Jeffersonian Republicans    1789  Madison was elected to the U S  House of Representatives with 57 37  of the vote  defeating James Monroe   1790  Madison was re elected with 97 79  of the vote  defeating Monroe   Supporters for ratification of the Constitution had become known as the Federalist Party   Those opposing the proposed constitution were labeled Anti Federalists   but neither group was a political party in the modern sense  Following ratification of the Constitution and formation of the first government in 1789  two new political factions formed along similar lines as the old division  The supporters of Alexander Hamilton  s attempts to strengthen the national government called themselves Federalists  while those who opposed Hamilton called themselves  Republicans   later historians would refer to them as the Democratic Republican party    Madison and other Democratic Party organizers  who favored states  rights and local control  were struggling to find an institutional solution to the Constitution s seeming inability to prevent concentration of power in an administrative republic     As first Secretary of the Treasury  Hamilton created many new federal institutions  including the Bank of the United States   Madison led the unsuccessful attempt in Congress to block Hamilton s proposal  arguing that the new Constitution did not explicitly allow the federal government to form a bank  As early as May 26  1792  Hamilton complained   Mr  Madison cooperating with Mr  Jefferson is at the head of a faction decidedly hostile to me and my administration     On May 5  1792  Madison told Washington   with respect to the spirit of party that was taking place    I was sensible of its existence     He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1794     In 1798 under President John Adams   the U S  and France unofficially went to warthe Quasi War   that involved naval warships and commercial vessels battling in the Caribbean  The Federalists created a standing army and passed laws against French refugees engaged in American politics and against Republican editors  Congressman Madison and Vice President Jefferson were outraged  Madison and Jefferson secretly drafted the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions declaring the Alien and Sedition Acts to be unconstitutional and noted that  states  in contesting obnoxious laws  should  interpose for arresting the progress of the evil      These turned out to be unpopular  even among republicans  since they called for state governments to invalidate federal laws  Jefferson went further  urging states to secede if necessary  though Madison convinced Jefferson to back down from this extreme view     According to Chernow  Madison s position  was a breathtaking evolution for a man who had pleaded at the Constitutional Convention that the federal government should possess a veto over state laws     Chernow feels that Madison s politics remained closely aligned with Jefferson s until his experience as president with a weak national government during the War of 1812 caused Madison to appreciate the need for a strong central government to aid national defense  At the time  he began to support a national bank  a stronger navy  and a standing army   The historian Gordon S  Wood says that Lance Banning  as in his Sacred Fire of Liberty  1995   is the  only present day scholar to maintain that Madison did not change his views in the 1790s     In claiming this  Banning downplays Madison s nationalism in the 1780s    Wood notes that many historians struggle to understand Madison  but Wood looks at him in the terms of Madison s own timesas a nationalist but one with a different conception of nationalism from the Federalists   He wanted to avoid a European style government and always thought that the embargo would ultimately have been successful    Thus  Wood assesses Madison from a different point of view    Gary Rosen and Banning use other approaches to suggest Madison s consistency         Madison was 43 when he married for the first time  which was considered late in that era  On September 15  1794  James Madison married Dolley Payne Todd   a 26 year old widow  at Harewood   in what is now Jefferson County  West Virginia     Madison had no children but did adopt Todd s one surviving son  John Payne Todd  known as Payne   after the marriage   Dolley Payne was born May 20  1768  at the New Garden Quaker settlement in North Carolina  where her parents  John Payne and Mary Coles Payne  lived briefly  Dolley s sister  Lucy Payne   had recently married George Steptoe Washington   a nephew of President Washington  As a member of Congress  Madison had doubtless met the widow Todd at social functions in Philadelphia  then the nation s capital  She had been living there with her late husband  In May 1794  Madison asked their mutual friend Aaron Burr to arrange a meeting  By August  she had accepted his proposal of marriage  For marrying Madison  a non Quaker  she was expelled from the Society of Friends    They were known to have a happy marriage  Dolley Madison put her social gifts to use when the couple lived in Washington  beginning when he was Secretary of State  With the White House still under construction  she advised as to its furnishings and sometimes served as First Lady for ceremonial functions for President Thomas Jefferson  a widower and their friend  When her husband was president  she created the role of First Lady  using her social talents to advance his program  She is credited with adding to his popularity in office   Madison s father died in 1801 and at age 50  Madison inherited the large plantation of Montpelier and other holdings  and his father s 108 slaves  He had begun to act as a steward of his father s properties by 1780  but this completed his takeover     When Thomas Jefferson was inaugurated as president in 1801  he named Madison to be his secretary of state  At the start of his term  Madison was a party to the United States Supreme Court case Marbury v  Madison  1803   in which the doctrine of judicial review was asserted by the high Court  much to the annoyance of the Jeffersonians who did not want a powerful federalist judiciary  The main challenge to the Jefferson Administration was maintaining neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars   Throughout Jefferson s presidency  much of Europe was at war  at first between France and Austria   After the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805  where France decisively defeated the Austrian Habsburgs   the conflict transformed into a grinding war between France and Britain   Shortly before Jefferson s election  Napoleon had seized power from the hapless French Directory   which had recently mismanaged France s finances in unsuccessful wars and had lost control of Saint Domingue  Haiti  after a slave rebellion  Beginning in 1802  Napoleon sent more than 20 000 troops to try to restore slavery on the island  as its colonial sugar cane plantations had been the chief revenue producer for France in the New World  The warfare went badly and the troops were further decimated by yellow fever   Napoleon gave up on thoughts of restoring the empire and sold the Louisiana territory to Madison and Jefferson in 1803  Later that year  the 7 000 surviving French troops were withdrawn from the island  and in 1804 Haiti declared its independence as the second republic in the western hemisphere   Many contemporaries and later historians  such as Ron Chernow   noted that Madison and President Jefferson ignored their  strict construction  view of the Constitution to take advantage of the purchase opportunity  Jefferson would have preferred to have a constitutional amendment authorizing the purchase  but did not have time nor was he required to do so  The Senate quickly ratified the treaty that completed the purchase  The House  with equal alacrity  passed enabling legislation    With the wars raging in Europe  Madison tried to maintain American neutrality  and insisted on the legal rights of the U S  as a neutral under international law   Neither London nor Paris showed much respect  however  and the situation deteriorated during Jefferson s second term  After Napoleon achieved victory at Austerlitz over his enemies in continental Europe  he became more aggressive and tried to starve Britain into submission with an embargo that was economically ruinous to both sides  Madison and Jefferson had also decided on an embargo to punish Britain and France  which forbade American trade with any foreign nation  The embargo failed in the United States just as it did in France  and caused massive hardships up and down the seaboard  which depended on foreign trade  The Federalists made a comeback in the Northeast by attacking the embargo  which was allowed to expire just as Jefferson was leaving office      pageneeded    With Jefferson s second term winding down  and his decision to retire widely known  Madison was the party choice for president in 1808  He was opposed by Rep  John Randolph   who had broken earlier with Jefferson and Madison  The Republican Party Congressional caucus chose the candidate and easily selected Madison over James Monroe    As the Federalist party by this time had largely collapsed outside New England  Madison easily defeated Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney      Upon his inauguration in 1809  Madison immediately had difficulty in his appointment selection of Sec  Albert Gallatin as Secretary of State    Under opposition from Sen  William B  Giles   Madison chose not to fight Congress for the nomination but kept Sec  Gallatin  a carry over from the Jefferson administration  in the Treasury    The talented Swiss  born Gallatin was Madison s primary advisor  confidant  and policy planner    Madison appointed Robert Smith for Secretary of State  Jefferson s former Secretary of Navy  For his Secretary of Navy  Madison appointed Paul Hamilton     Madison s cabinet  which included men of arguably mediocre talent  was chosen for the purposes of national interest and political harmony    When Madison assumed office in 1809  the federal government had a surplus of  9 500 000  by 1810 the national debt had been reduced  and taxes cut     Madison sought to continue Jefferson s agenda  in particular the dismantling of the system left behind by the Federalist Party under Washington and Adams  One of the most pressing issues Madison confronted was the first Bank of the United States   Its twenty year charter was scheduled to expire in 1811  and while Madison s treasury secretary said the bank was a necessity  Congress failed to re authorize it  As the absence of a national bank made war with Britain very difficult to finance  Congress passed a bill in 1814 chartering a second national bank  Madison vetoed it    In 1816  Congress passed another bill to charter a second national bank  Madison signed the act  having learned the bank was needed from the war with Britain       By 1809 the Federalist party was no longer competitive outside a few strongholds  Some former members  such as John Quincy Adams   Madison s ambassador to Russia  had joined Madison s Republican party    Though one party appeared to dominate  it had begun to split into rival factions  which would later form the basis of the modern party system  In particular  with hostilities against Britain appearing increasingly likely  factions in favor of and against war with Britain formed in Congress    The predominant faction  the  War Hawks   were led by House Speaker Henry Clay   When war finally did break out  the war effort was led by the War Hawks in Congress under Clay at least as much as it was by Madison  this accorded with the president s preference for checks and balances   Napoleon had won a decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805  and as a consequence Europe remained mostly at peace for the next few years  Congress repealed Jefferson s embargo shortly before Madison became president    America s new  nonintercourse  policy was to trade with all countries including France and Britain if restrictions on shipping were removed    Madison s diplomatic efforts in April 1809  although initially promising  to get the British to withdraw the Orders in Council were rejected by British Foreign Secretary George Canning     By August 1809  diplomatic relations with Britain deteriorated as minister David Erskine was withdrawn and replaced by  hatchet man  Francis James Jackson   Madison however  resisted calls for war    In his Political Observations from April 20  1795 Madison had stated   After Jackson accused Madison of duplicity with Erskine  Madison had Jackson barred from the State Department and sent packing to Boston    During his first State of the Union Address in November 1809  Madison asked Congress for advice and alternatives concerning the British American trade crisis  and warned of the possibility of war  By spring 1810  Madison was specifically asking Congress for more appropriations to increase the Army and Navy in preparation for war with Britain    Together with the effects of European peace  the United States economy began to recover early in Madison s presidency  By the time Madison was standing for reelection  the Peninsular War in Spain had spread  while at the same time Napoleon invaded Russia   and the entire European continent was once again embroiled in war   The United States entered the War of 1812   which in many respects was a theater of the broader Napoleonic Wars   Napoleon began his Continental System   intended to force other European countries to join his embargo on Britain  Although he was initially successful in starving out Britain  Portugal refused to capitulate  leading to the Peninsular War throughout Spain  This loosened Spain s grip on its South American colonies  Soon Great Britain was the only major power in the Atlantic   As Great Britain increased naval pressure against Napoleon  it inadvertently did the same against American ships  Some British tactics quickly caused widespread American anger  Britain had used its navy to prevent American ships from trading with France  the United States  which was a neutral nation  saw this act as a violation of international law  The Royal Navy boarded American ships on the high seas and impressed its seamen  as it needed more sailors than it could recruit  The United States considered this no less an affront to American sovereignty than an invasion of American soil      Britain also armed Indian tribes in the Northwest Territory and encouraged them to attack settlers  even though Britain had ceded this territory to the United States by treaties in 1783 and 1794   Americans called for a  second war of independence  to restore honor and stature to the new nation    An angry public elected a  war hawk  Congress  led by Henry Clay and John C  Calhoun   Madison asked Congress for a declaration of war  which was passed along sectional and party lines  with intense opposition from the Federalists and the Northeast  where the economy had suffered during Jefferson s trade embargo        Madison hurriedly called on Congress to put the country  into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis   specifically recommending enlarging the army  preparing the militia  finishing the military academy  stockpiling munitions  and expanding the navy    Madison faced formidable obstaclesa divided cabinet  a factious party  a recalcitrant Congress  obstructionist governors  and incompetent generals  together with militia who refused to fight outside their states  Most serious was lack of unified popular support  There were serious threats of disunion from New England  which engaged in extensive smuggling with Canada and refused to provide financial support or soldiers    The problems were worse due to Jefferson s and Madison s dismantling of the system built by Hamilton and the Federalists  They had reduced the military  closed the Bank of the U S   and narrowed the tax system  They distrusted standing armies and banks  and the dismantling of the federalist taxation system meant they could not finance the quick hiring of mercenaries  By the time the war began  Madison s military force consisted mostly of poorly trained militia members   The senior command at the War Department and in the field proved incompetent or cowardlythe general at Detroit surrendered to a smaller British force without firing a shot  Gallatin at the Treasury discovered the war was almost impossible to fund  since the national bank had been closed and major financiers in the Northeast refused to help  Madison believed the U S  could easily seize Canada and thus cut off food supplies to the West Indies  making for a good bargaining chip at the peace talks  But the US invasion efforts all failed  Madison had believed the state militias would rally to the flag and invade Canada  but the governors in the Northeast failed to cooperate  Their militias either sat out the war or refused to leave their respective states for action    The British armed American Indians in the Northwest  most notably several tribes allied with the Shawnee chief  Tecumseh   But  after losing control of Lake Erie at the naval Battle of Lake Erie in 1813  the British were forced to retreat  General William Henry Harrison caught up with them at the Battle of the Thames   where he destroyed the British and Indian armies  killed Tecumseh  and permanently destroyed Indian power in the Great Lakes region  Madison remains the only president to lead troops in battle while in office  although that Battle of Bladensburg  in 1814  did not go well for the American side      The British then raided Washington  as Madison headed a dispirited militia  Dolley Madison rescued White House valuables and documents shortly before the British burned the White House  the Capitol and other public buildings       By 1814  Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison had destroyed the main Indian threats in the South and West  respectively  As part of the war effort  an American naval shipyard was built up at Sackets Harbor  New York   where thousands of men produced twelve warships and had another nearly ready by the end of the war  American frigates and other vessels  such as the USS Constitution   USS United States   USS Chesapeake   USS Hornet   USS Wasp     disambiguation needed   and USS Essex   won some significant naval battles on the Great Lakes  In late 1814  Madison and his Secretary of War James Monroe unsuccessfully attempted to establish a national draft of 40 000 men during the war    Antiwar Congressman Daniel Webster of New Hampshire fiercely criticized the proposal on the House floor    and nothing ultimately came of it   In a famous three hour battle with the HMS Java   the USS Constitution earned her nickname   Old Ironsides     The U S  fleet on Lake Erie went up against a superior British force there and destroyed or captured the entire British Fleet on the lake  Commander Oliver Hazard Perry reported his victory with the simple statement   We have met the enemy  and they are ours     America had built up one of the largest merchant fleets in the world  though it had been partially dismantled under Jefferson and Madison  Madison authorized many of these ships to become privateers in the war  Armed  they captured 1 800 British ships     The courageous  successful defense of Ft  McHenry   which guarded the seaway to Baltimore   against one of the most intense naval bombardments in history  over 24 hours   led Francis Scott Key to write the poem that was set to music as the U S  national anthem    The Star Spangled Banner      In New Orleans  Gen  Andrew Jackson put together a force including regular Army troops  militia  frontiersmen  Creoles  Native American allies and Jean Lafitte  s pirates  The Battle of New Orleans took place two weeks after peace treaty was drafted  but before it was ratified  so the war was not over   The American defenders repulsed the British invasion army in the most decisive victory of the war    The Treaty of Ghent ended the war in February 1815  with no territorial gains on either side  The Americans felt that their national honor had been restored in what has been called  the Second War of American Independence     On March 3  1815  the U S  Congress authorized deployment of naval power against Algiers  and two squadrons were assembled and readied for war  the Second Barbary War would mark the beginning of the end for piracy in that region   To most Americans  the quick succession of events at the end of the war  the burning of the capital  the Battle of New Orleans  and the Treaty of Ghent  appeared as though American valor at New Orleans had forced the British to surrender after almost winning  This view  while inaccurate  strongly contributed to the post war euphoria that persisted for a decade  It also helps explain the significance of the war  even if it was strategically inconclusive  Napoleon was defeated for the last time at the Battle of Waterloo near the end of Madison s presidency  and as the Napoleonic Wars ended  so did the War of 1812  Madison s final years began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity  which was called the Era of Good Feelings   Madison s reputation as President improved and Americans finally believed the United States had established itself as a world power     With peace finally established  Americans believed they had secured a solid independence from Britain  The Federalist Party  which had called for secession over the war at the Hartford Convention   dissolved and disappeared from politics  With Europe finally at peace  the Era of Good Feelings described the prosperity and relatively equable political environment  Some political contention continued  for instance  in 1816  two thirds of the incumbents in Congress were defeated for re election after having voted to increase their salary  Madison approved a Hamiltonian national bank  an effective taxation system based on tariffs  a standing professional military  and the internal improvements championed by Henry Clay under his American System   In 1816  pensions were extended to orphans and widows of the War of 1812 for a period of 5 years at the rate of half pay    However  in his last act before leaving office  he vetoed the Bonus Bill of 1817   which would have financed more internal improvements  including roads  bridges  and canals     Having considered the bill    I am constrained by the insuperable difficulty I feel in reconciling this bill with the Constitution of the United States     The legislative powers vested in Congress are specified    in the    Constitution  and it does not appear that the power proposed to be exercised by the bill is among the enumerated powers   Madison rejected the view of Congress that the General Welfare provision of the Taxing and Spending Clause justified the bill  stating   Such a view of the Constitution would have the effect of giving to Congress a general power of legislation instead of the defined and limited one hitherto understood to belong to them  the terms  common defense and general welfare  embracing every object and act within the purview of a legislative trust   Madison urged a variety of measures that he felt were  best executed under the national authority   including federal support for roads and canals that would  bind more closely together the various parts of our extended confederacy      James Wilkinson was a controversial U S  military commander and appointed governor of the Louisiana Territory by Thomas Jefferson in 1805    Wilkinson had earlier been implicated in Aaron Burr  s conspiracy to form a new nation in the West and taking Spanish gold  however  he was exonerated in 1808    Jefferson chose to retain Wilkinson  a Republican  for political expedience     After Madison assumed the Presidency in 1809  he placed Wilkinson in charge of Terre aux Boeufs on the Louisiana coast to protect the U S  from invasion    Wilkinson proved to be an incompetent general  many soldiers complained that he was ineffectual  their tents were defective  and they became sick by malaria   dysentery   and scurvy   dozens died daily    Wilkinson made excuses and refused to move inland from the mosquito infested coastline    A two year congressional investigation into the Wilkinson matter proved to be inconclusive  and Madison had to decide whether to keep or sack him    Like Jefferson  Madison chose to retain Wilkinson for political reasons  as Wilkinson had influence as a Pennsylvania Republican      By retaining Wilkinson  both Jefferson and Madison supported military leaders in both the Army and Navy for political reasons rather than competence      Historian Robert Allen Rutland stated the Wilkinson affair left  scars on the War Department  and  left Madison surrounded by senior military incompetents      at the beginning of the War of 1812     After Wilkinson s two battle defeats by the British  Madison relieved the officer from active military service     Upon assuming office on March 4  1809 James Madison  in his first Inaugural Address to the nation  stated that the federal government s duty was to convert the American Indians by the  participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state     Like Jefferson  Madison had a paternalistic attitude toward American Indians  encouraging the men to give up hunting and become farmers    Although there are scant details  Madison often met with Southeastern and Western Indians who included the Creek and Osage     As pioneers and settlers moved West into large tracts of Cherokee   Choctaw   Creek   and Chickasaw territory  Madison ordered the US Army to protect Native lands from intrusion by settlers  to the chagrin of his military commander Andrew Jackson   Jackson wanted the President to ignore Indian pleas to stop the invasion of their lands   and resisted carrying out the president s order    In the Northwest Territory after the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811  Indians were pushed off their tribal lands and replaced entirely by white settlers    By 1815  with a population of 400 000 European American settlers in Ohio  Indian rights to their lands had effectively become null and void      Madison appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States    Madison appointed eleven other federal judges  two to the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia   and nine to the various United States district courts   One of those judges was appointed twice  to different seats on the same court   When Madison left office in 1817  he retired to Montpelier   his tobacco plantation in Orange County  Virginia   not far from Jefferson s Monticello   He was 65 years old  Dolley  who thought they would finally have a chance to travel to Paris  was 49  As with both Washington and Jefferson  Madison left the presidency a poorer man than when he entered  due to the steady financial collapse of his plantation  aided by the continued low price of tobacco and his stepson s mismanagement   Insight into Madison is provided by the first  White House memoir   A Colored Man s Reminiscences of James Madison  1865   told by his former slave Paul Jennings   who served the president from the age of 10 as a footman  and later as a valet for the rest of Madison s life  After Madison s death  Jennings was purchased in 1845 from Dolley Madison by arrangement with the senator Daniel Webster   who enabled him to work off the cost and gain his freedom  Jennings published his short account in 1865    He had the highest respect for Madison and said he never struck a slave  nor permitted an overseer to do so  Jennings said that if a slave misbehaved  Madison would meet with the person privately to try to talk about the behavior     Some historians speculate that Madison s mounting debt was one of the chief reasons why he refused to allow his notes on the Constitutional Convention  or its official records which he possessed  to be published in his lifetime   He knew the value of his notes  and wanted them to bring money to his estate for Dolley s use as his plantation failedhe was hoping for one hundred thousand dollars from the sale of his papers  of which the notes were the gem     Madison s financial troubles weighed on him  and deteriorating mental and physical health would haunt him   In his later years  Madison became extremely concerned about his historic legacy  He took to modifying letters and other documents in his possession  changing days and dates  adding and deleting words and sentences  and shifting characters  By the time he had reached his late seventies  this  straightening out  had become almost an obsession  As an example  he edited a letter written to Jefferson criticizing Lafayette  Madison not only inked out original passages  but imitated Jefferson s handwriting as well in making changes      During the final six years of his life  amid a sea of personal  financial  troubles that were threatening to engulf him   At times mental agitation issued in physical collapse  For the better part of a year in 1831 and 1832 he was bedridden  if not silenced    Literally sick with anxiety  he began to despair of his ability to make himself understood by his fellow citizens      In 1826  after the death of Jefferson  Madison was appointed as the second Rector   President   of the University of Virginia   He retained the position as college chancellor for ten years until his death in 1836   In 1829  at the age of 78  Madison was chosen as a representative to the constitutional convention in Richmond for the revising of the Virginia state constitution  It was his last appearance as a legislator and constitutional drafter  The issue of greatest importance at this convention was apportionment   The western districts of Virginia complained that they were underrepresented because the state constitution apportioned voting districts by county  not population  The growing population in the Piedmont and western parts of the state were not reflected in their representation in the legislature  Western reformers also wanted to extend suffrage to all white men  in place of the historic property requirement  Madison tried to effect a compromise  but to no avail  Eventually  suffrage rights were extended to renters as well as landowners  but the eastern planters refused to adopt population apportionment  Madison was disappointed at the failure of Virginians to resolve the issue more equitably   Madison was very concerned about the continuing issue of slavery in Virginia and the South  He believed that transportation of free American blacks to Africa offered a solution  as promoted by the American Colonization Society  ACS     He told Lafayette at the time of the convention that colonization would create a  rapid erasure of the blot on our Republican character     The British sociologist Harriet Martineau visited with Madison during her tour of the United States in 1834  She characterized his faith in colonization as the solution to slavery as  bizarre and incongruous     Madison may have sold or donated his gristmill in support of the ACS    The historian Drew R  McCoy believes that  The Convention of 1829  we might say  pushed Madison steadily to the brink of self delusion  if not despair  The dilemma of slavery undid him       Like most African Americans of the time  Madison s slaves wanted to remain in the U S  where they had been born and believed their work earned them citizenship  they resisted  repatriation      Through failing health  Madison wrote several memoranda on political subjects  including an essay against the appointment of chaplains for Congress and the armed forces  He felt it would produce religious exclusion but not political harmony     Between 1834 and 1835  Madison sold 25  of his slaves to make up for financial losses on his plantation    Madison lived until 1836  increasingly ignored by the new leaders of the American polity  He died at Montpelier on June 28  as the last of the Founding Fathers    He was buried in the Madison Family Cemetery at Montpelier     In 1842  Dolley Madison sold the Montpelier mansion  and in 1844 sold the extensive plantation lands to Henry W  Moncure    She leased half of the remaining slaves to Moncure  The other half were inherited by her  her son John Payne Todd   and James Madison  Jr   a nephew    Between 1845 and 1849 Todd sold numerous slaves  by 1851 he retained only 15 at his residence    By 1850  the Montpelier plantation was a  ghost of its former self     In 1851  Montpelier was owned by Thomas Thorton  an Englishman  he held 40 slaves     The historian Garry Wills wrote   Madison s claim on our admiration does not rest on a perfect consistency  any more than it rests on his presidency  He has other virtues      As a framer and defender of the Constitution he had no peer      The finest part of Madison s performance as president was his concern for the preserving of the Constitution      No man could do everything for the countrynot even Washington  Madison did more than most  and did some things better than any  That was quite enough     George F  Will once wrote that if we truly believed that the pen is mightier than the sword  our nation s capital would have been called  Madison  D C    instead of Washington  D C     Madison s writings are studied for the debate over human rights among different classes of citizens in the 21st century  Madison appears to have anticipated the danger of a strong majority imposing its will on a weaker minority by popular vote    Madison  in The Federalist Papers   in Federalist No  51   wrote   It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers  but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part    In a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker  anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature  where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger   In 1986  Congress created the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation as part of the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution  The Foundation offers  24 000 graduate level fellowships to secondary teachers to undertake a master s degree which emphasizes the study of the Constitution  Montpelier   his family s plantation and his home in Orange  Virginia  has been designated a National Historic Landmark    Many counties  several towns  cities  educational institutions  a mountain range and a river are named after Madison   US
